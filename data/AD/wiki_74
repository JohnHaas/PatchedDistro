Sea anemone

Sea anemones are a group of water-dwelling, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria. They are named for the anemone, a terrestrial flower. Sea anemones are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. Anthozoa often have large polyps that allow for digestion of larger prey and also lack a medusa stage. As cnidarians, sea anemones are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and "Hydra".
Anatomy.
A sea anemone is a polyp attached at the bottom to the surface beneath it by an adhesive foot, called a basal disc, with a column-shaped body ending in an oral disc. Most are from in diameter, but anemones as small as or as large as nearly are known. They can have anywhere from a few tens to a few hundred tentacles.
A few species are pelagic and are not attached to the bottom; instead they have a gas chamber within the pedal disc, allowing them to float upside down in the water.
The mouth, also the anus of the sea anemone, is in the middle of the oral disc surrounded by tentacles armed with many cnidocytes, which are cells that function as a defense and as a means to capture prey. Cnidocytes contain nematocyst, capsule-like organelles capable of everting, giving phylum Cnidaria its name. The cnidae that sting are called "nematocysts". Each nematocyst contains a small vesicle filled with toxins (actinoporins), an inner filament, and an external sensory hair. A touch to the hair mechanically triggers a cell explosion—which launches a harpoon-like structure that attaches to organisms that trigger it, and injects a dose of venom in the flesh of the aggressor or prey. This gives the anemone its characteristic sticky feeling. The sea anemone eats small fish and shrimp.
The venom is a mix of toxins, including neurotoxins, that paralyzes the prey so the anemone can move it to the mouth for digestion inside the gastrovascular cavity. Actinoporins have been reported as highly toxic to fish and crustaceans, which are the natural prey of sea anemones. Anemonefish (clownfish), small banded fish in various colors, are not affected by their host anemone's sting and shelter themselves from predators among its tentacles. Most sea anemones are harmless to humans, but a few highly toxic species have caused severe injuries and are potentially lethal.
The internal anatomy of anemones is quite complex.
Digestive system.
A gastrovascular cavity (which functions as a stomach) with a single opening to the outside is both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening, which can be described as an incomplete gut. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a "siphonophore", is ciliated, and helps to circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity. Some anemones feed on small particles, which are caught with the aid of a mucus secretion and moving currents that are set up by the tentacles. Most sea anemones are predacious, immobilizing their prey with the aid of their nematocysts.
The mouth opens into a flattened pharynx. This consists of an in-folding of the body wall, and is therefore lined by the animal's epidermis. The pharynx typically runs for about two-thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the remainder of the body.
The gastrovascular cavity itself is divided into a number of chambers by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge at the base of the pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central pharynx. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and includes filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as "acontial filaments".
Nerve system.
A primitive nervous system, without centralization, coordinates the processes involved in maintaining homeostasis as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli. There are no specialized sense organs.
The muscles and nerves are much simpler than those of most other animals, although more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers are not true muscles because they are not freely suspended in the body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter.
Since the anemone lacks a skeleton, the contractile cells pull against the gastrovascular cavity, which acts as a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by shutting its mouth, which keeps the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume, making it more rigid. Although generally sessile, sea anemones are capable of slow movements using their pedal disc, or of swimming, using either their tentacles or by flexing their body.
Life cycle.
Unlike other cnidarians, anemones (and other anthozoans) entirely lack the free-swimming medusa stage of the life cycle; the polyp produces eggs and sperm, and the fertilized egg develops into a planula that develops directly into another polyp.
Anemones tend to stay in the same spot until conditions become unsuitable (prolonged dryness, for example), or a predator attacks them. In that case anemones can release themselves from the substrate and use flexing motions to swim to a new location. Most sea anemones attach temporarily to submerged objects; a few thrust themselves into the sand or live in burrows; a few are parasitic on other marine organisms and some have symbiotic relationships with hermit crabs.
The sexes in sea anemones are separate in some species, while other species, like the brooding anemone ("Epiactis prolifera"), are protandric hermaphrodites. The gonads are strips of tissue within the mesenteries. Both sexual and asexual reproduction can occur. In sexual reproduction males release sperm to stimulate females to release eggs, and fertilization occurs. Anemones eject eggs and sperm through the mouth. The fertilized egg develops into a planula, which settles and grows into a single polyp.
Anemones can also reproduce asexually, by budding, binary fission (the polyp separates into two halves), and pedal laceration, in which small pieces of the pedal disc break off and regenerate into small anemones.
Ecology.
The sea anemone has an oral disk, which the organism uses to capture prey. The anemone attaches to the substrate using the basal disk at its posterior end. Others also burrow into weaker objects. Some species attach to kelp while others are free-swimming. 
Symbiotic relationships.
Although not plants and therefore incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative symbiotic relationship with certain single-celled green algae species that reside in the animals' gastrodermal cells. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from the products of the algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, nematocysts, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores.
A second symbiotic relationship is formed between some sea anemones and clownfish.
Habitats.
Most species inhabit tropical reefs, although there are species adapted to relatively cold waters, intertidal reefs, and sand/kelp environments.
Exploitation.
The global trade of marine ornamentals has been a rapidly expanding industry involving numerous countries worldwide. In the early 1980s, the estimated value of imported marine fish and invertebrates was US$24–40 million annually. Current estimates place that value at US$200–330 million, with the United States accounting for 80% of the industry imports. Despite advances and the expansion of aquaculture, post-larval capture and rearing, the majority of marine ornamentals are collected in the wild as adults or juveniles.
Anemones are susceptible to overexploitation due to their long life spans, slower relative growth rates, and lower reproductive rates than their resident fish, which are also affected due to the fact that they settle exclusively and are restricted to specific host sea anemones. The demand for these organisms is reflected in fishermen's catch records, which document the value they are paid per catch, and on average sea anemones were valued at five times the average value of anemonefish, and ten times the value of the most abundant anemonefish, and in fact only made up 4.1% of the total value of the catch.
Research has shown that aquarium fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemonefish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas, and could also negatively impact anemone shrimp, and any organisms obligately associated with sea anemones. It should be noted that anemonefish can survive alone in captivity, as has been shown by multiple research efforts.
In southern Italy and southwestern Spain the anemone "Anemonia sulcata" is consumed as a delicacy. The whole animal is marinated in vinegar, then coated in a tempura-like batter and deep-fried in olive oil. They are similar in appearance and texture to croquettes, but have an intense seafood taste.
Fossil record.
Most Actiniaria do not form hard parts that can be recognized as fossils, but a few do exist; "Mackenzia", from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of Canada, is the oldest fossil identified as a sea anemone.

Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves

"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves" is the first single released by Cher for the album of the same name, her seventh solo album. It was her first chart-topper as a solo artist in the United States. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA for the sales of over 1 million copies.
Song information.
"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves" was the first single from Cher's 1971 eponymous album "Cher". The album was subsequently renamed and re-released as "Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves" after the success of the single. The song was written by songwriter Bob Stone as a story-song called "Gypsys, Tramps and White Trash". Producer Snuff Garrett advised that the title be changed and Stone then changed it to "Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves".
Released four years after her last top ten hit "You Better Sit Down Kids", this song was very much a comeback single for Cher, not only returning her to the top ten of the charts but also giving her two weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1971. The single also reached #1 in Canada and #4 in the United Kingdom. It became Cher's best-selling single at that point, selling more than 4.5 million copies worldwide.
The song describes the life of a girl, the narrator of the song, who was "born in the wagon of a traveling show". Her mother "used to dance for the money they'd throw", while her father would do "whatever he could; preach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good". Although the people of the town insulted them with such terms suggested in the title of the song, they paid them well "every night" for their services.
When a young man is picked up in Mobile, the narrator is 16, while he is 21. Her family took care of him for a while and allowed him to travel with them, although her father "would have shot him if he knew what he'd done". Three months later, the narrator describes herself as a "girl in trouble", and her young man has disappeared.
Echoing the beginning of the song, the narrator's own daughter was "born in the wagon of a traveling show", while the narrator now dances "for the money they throw" and "Grandpa" — the narrator's own father — supported them in just the same way as before. 
The title of this song has also been shown with the alternative spelling "Gypsies", this of course being a correct spelling of this word, which can also be spelt "Gipsies", but never "Gypsys".
The lyrics of the song are often ridiculed for their claim to have "picked up a boy just south of Mobile", the idea being that "just south of Mobile" is somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, there are at least six small communities directly south of Mobile on the west side of the bay, and twice that many on the east side. 
The song has been adopted by Clyde F.C., a Scottish football team whose fans are known as "The Gypsy Army", and the song is played before the kickoff of home matches at Broadwood Stadium.
English punk rock band Anti-Nowhere League covered the song on their 2006 album "Pig Iron – The Album".
The song was featured in an episode of the popular British motoring show "Top Gear", in which the hosts traveled to Miami to purchase a car for $1000 and go on a road trip. The song played when the hosts were crossing into Alabama as a joke.
In the 2000 TV mini-series "The 10th Kingdom", John Larroquette's character sings this song to a group of gypsys after they threaten to kill him if he does not sing.
Live performances.
Cher performed the song on the following concert tours:
Music video.
The video for "Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves" was Cher's first music video. The video was a recorded performance of the song on "The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour" in 1971. Throughout the video Cher is singing in front of a house wagon and in front of a fire. A second video was made, but it was very similar to the original. In the second video, clips of dancing female gypsies were shown.
Remix version.
In 2002, a special remix medley was created by Dan-O-Rama for a video montage that was used in Cher's . The medley contains the videos of "All I Really Want to Do", "Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves", "Half-Breed", and "Dark Lady".

West Virginia Mountaineer

History.
In the 1930s the unofficial mascot appeared at West Virginia University sporting events wearing flannel shirts, bearskin capes and coonskin caps. At first volunteers, Burton “Irish” Crow, Lawson Hill, William “Buckwheat” Jackson, among others made appearances throughout the season.
Beginning in 1934, The Monticola (the WVU yearbook) sponsored a contest to determine the male senior who had contributed most to the university throughout his four years in college. This male was entitled to be, “The Mountaineer.” However, within the next decade the choice shifted to a person who suited the role. This dropped the restriction of a male senior, who had done the most for the university. 
In 1936, the Mountain honorary society selected Boyd Harrison “Slim” Arnold to be the first official “buckskin-clad”.
The Mountain honorary society was not active for three years, during this time the president of the student body was responsible for choosing the Mountaineer. (3)
Currently, The Mountain Honorary Society still chooses the Mountaineer through an intense application and interview process. Finalists are decided based on outstanding character and enthusiasm. Finalists then compete in a cheer-off at a WVU basketball game. The winner receives a tuition waiver or scholarship. 
The Mountaineer was first used in commerce in 1972 and registered as a U.S. trademark in 1985. Mountaineer’s retired rifles, and costumes are housed in a glass case in the Vandalia lounge of the Mountainlair, located on the downtown campus. In 1950, The Mountain Honorary Society held a Mountaineer Statue Festival raising $15,000. This bought the bronze statue of the Mountaineer in the Mountainlair front lawn.
Natalie Tennant, who became the West Virginia secretary of state in January 2009, served as the first female Mountaineer in 1990. Rebecca Durst was the only other woman to fill the role in 2009. Rock Wilson is the only Mountaineer to serve the position for three years (1991-1994). 
The current West Virginia University Mountaineer is Jonathan Kimble. He is a from Franklin, WV in Pendleton County. Jonathan Kimble is a graduate student at WVU, majoring in Industrial & Labor Relations.
West Virginia University Athletic Traditions.
One of the most beloved of all West Virginia athletic traditions, the Mountaineer first appeared at WVU sporting events in the late 1920s.
Daily Athenaeum articles indicate that designating individuals to serve as the Mountaineer started as early as 1927. Clay Crouse was designated that year followed in 1932 by Burton Crow and then Bill Fahey. Others may have served. However, it was not until 1934-35 when trackster Lawson Hill was selected by Mountain that a more stable process was established. By 1937, the Mountaineer was being selected on an annual basis by Mountain.
The Mountaineer is a member of the student body chosen by Mountain for outstanding enthusiasm, character, service to the community and academics. The mascot symbolizes the proud and rich heritage of the Mountain State and its people.
However, the Mountaineer doesn't just have responsibilities associated with athletics. The mascot is expected to appear at community and alumni events to promote Mountaineer spirit statewide.
Candidates apply to become the Mountaineer by writing essays about why they want the position. From there, they are interviewed by Mountain members and representatives of the athletic department and student affairs. The top candidates are then invited to "cheer-off" at the next-to-last home basketball event each season. There, the candidates are judged and the Mountaineer is announced at the season's final basketball game.
Boyd H. "Slim" Arnold, a physical education major from Bayard in Grant County, was the first Mountaineer selected to serve three years in succession (1937-38-39) and was the longest tenured until Rock Wilson equaled it in 1993. (1991-92-93).
During Arnold's tenure, he became the first Mountaineer to wear the now traditional buckskin uniform. Minutes of Mountain meetings from the late 1930s indicate that a donor gave the Honorary several deerskins asking that a buckskin costume be made for the Mountaineer. Prior to that the Mountaineer wore overalls, a flannel shirt, coonskin cap, a sheep or bear skin type vest and carried a rifle.
The post has remained relatively unchanged since that time. The costume is tailored to fit each year's winner, and male Mountaineers customarily grow beards during their tenure. The rifle is a true flintlock that requires the user to become schooled in the amount of powder required to fire the charge.
In 1991, Natalie Tennant of Fairview became the first female selected as Mountaineer. 
Duties.
The responsibilities of the Mountaineer Mascot are set forth by the
Mountaineer Advisory Committee Manual Regulations. The Mountaineer must attend every away and home West Virginia Mountaineers football game, as well as every home men’s and women’s basketball games. They might also be required to travel with the team as determined by the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. The mascot is also encouraged to attend certain events such as alumni events, community events, and visit the WVU Children’s Hospital. It is said that the Mountaineer may make close to 300 appearances per year. He or she is also responsible for the cleaning, care, and handling of the rifle and no one else is allowed to fire it except for himself or herself or the Alternate Mountaineer. Additionally, the Mountaineer is expected to follow a proper code of conduct at all times. While in costume, the mascot cannot be under the influence of alcohol or use tobacco at any time, and may not accept money or gifts for appearances or endorse a company or product for profit.
" "The guy who makes the rifle, I go to him for gunpowder, and he gives me however much I need. We get a new rifle approximately every eight to 10 years that’s passed down from each Mountaineer to Mountaineer. The buckskin is made out of real deerskin. They’re custom to each Mountaineer, and we get to keep those." " - Mountaineer Mascot, Jonathan Kimble 
Traditions.
The Mountaineer Mascot is a part of many traditions at West Virginia University. Most of them are associated with sporting events. It is the Mountaineer who leads the football team onto Mountaineer Field every game, firing his or her rifle into the air. The Mountaineer also leads the fans, along with the cheerleaders, on the football field and the basketball court in the Let’s Go Mountaineers cheer and other cheers.

Human trafficking

Human trafficking is the trade in humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation for the trafficker or others, or for the extraction of organs or tissues, including surrogacy and ova removal. Human trafficking can occur within a country or trans-nationally. Human trafficking is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation. Human trafficking is the trade in people, and does not necessarily involve the movement of the person to another location.
Human trafficking represents an estimated $32 billion of international trade per annum, of the illegal international trade estimated at $650 billion per annum in 2010.
Human trafficking is condemned as a violation of human rights by international conventions. In addition, human trafficking is subject to a directive in the European Union.
Overview.
Although it can occur at local levels, human trafficking has transnational implications, as recognized by the United Nations in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (also referred to as the "Trafficking Protocol"), an international agreement under the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC) which entered into force on 25 December 2003. The protocol is one of three which supplement the CTOC. The "Trafficking Protocol" is the first global, legally binding instrument on trafficking in over half a century, and the only one with an agreed-upon definition of trafficking in persons. One of its purposes is to facilitate international cooperation in investigating and prosecuting such trafficking. Another is to protect and assist human trafficking's victims with full respect for their rights as established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The "Trafficking Protocol" defines human trafficking as
The "Trafficking Protocol" was adopted by the United Nations in Palermo in 2000 and entered into force on 25 December 2003. As of March 2013 it has been signed by 117 countries and ratified by 154 parties.
In 2004, the total annual revenue for trafficking in persons were estimated to be between USD$5 billion and $9 billion.
In 2005, Patrick Belser of ILO estimated a global annual profit of $31.6 billion. In 2008, the United Nations estimated nearly 2.5 million people from 127 different countries are being trafficked into 137 countries around the world.
As of 2013, the U.S. government estimates that at any given time, approximately 27 million men, women, and children may be victims of human trafficking (Seelke 1) and within that 27 million, 18,000 people from over 50 countries are trafficked into the United States every year and over 300,000 children are trafficked within the U.S. annually.
Definition and usage.
Human trafficking differs from people smuggling, which involves a person voluntarily requesting or hiring another individual to covertly transport them across an international border, usually because the smuggled person would be denied entry into a country by legal channels. Though illegal, there may be no deception or coercion involved. After entry into the country and arrival at their ultimate destination, the smuggled person is usually free to find their own way.
According to the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), people smuggling is a crime against the State due to the violation of national immigration laws, and does not require violations of the rights of the smuggled person. Human trafficking, on the other hand, is a crime against a person because of the violation of the victim's rights through coercion and exploitation.
While smuggling requires travel, trafficking does not. Much of the confusion rests with the term itself, as the word "trafficking" evokes the idea of transport or travel. However, unlike most cases of people smuggling, victims of human trafficking are not permitted to leave upon arrival at their destination. They are held against their will through acts of coercion, and forced to work for or provide services to the trafficker or others. The work or services may include anything from bonded or forced labor to commercial sexual exploitation. The arrangement may be structured as a work contract, but with no or low payment, or on terms which are highly exploitative. Sometimes the arrangement is structured as debt bondage, with the victim not being permitted or able to pay off the debt.
Bonded labor, or debt bondage, is probably the least known form of labor trafficking today, and yet it is the most widely used method of enslaving people. Victims become "bonded" when their labor is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan or service in which its terms and conditions have not been defined or in which the value of the victims’ services is not applied toward the liquidation of the debt. Generally, the value of their work is greater than the original sum of money "borrowed."
Forced labor is a situation in which victims are forced to work against their own will under the threat of violence or some other form of punishment; their freedom is restricted and a degree of ownership is exerted. Men are at risk of being trafficked for unskilled work, which globally generates 31 billion USD according to the International Labor Organization. Forms of forced labor can include domestic servitude, agricultural labor, sweatshop factory labor, janitorial, food service and other service industry labor, and begging. Some of the products produced by forced labor are: clothing, cocoa, bricks, coffee, cotton, and gold, among others.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM), the single largest global provider of services to victims of trafficking, reports receiving an increasing number of cases in which victims of trafficked were subjected to forced labour. A 2012 study observes that “…2010 was particularly notable as the first year in which IOM assisted more victims of labour trafficking than those who had been trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation.”
Child labour is a form of work that is likely to be hazardous to the physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development of children and can interfere with their education. The International Labor Organization estimates worldwide that there are 246 million exploited children aged between 5 and 17 involved in debt bondage, forced recruitment for armed conflict, prostitution, pornography, the illegal drug trade, the illegal arms trade, and other illicit activities around the world.June 2012
General.
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has further assisted many non-governmental organizations in their fight against human trafficking. The 2006 armed conflict in Lebanon, which saw 300,000 domestic workers from Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and the Philippines jobless and targets of traffickers, led to an emergency information campaign with NGO Caritas Migrant to raise human-trafficking awareness. Additionally, an April 2006 report, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, helped to identify 127 countries of origin, 98 transit countries and 137 destination countries for human trafficking. To date, it is the second most frequently downloaded UNODC report. Continuing into 2007, UNODC supported initiatives like the Community Vigilance project along the border between India and Nepal, as well as provided subsidy for NGO trafficking prevention campaigns in Bosnia, Croatia, and Herzegovina. Public service announcements have also proved useful for organizations combating human trafficking. In addition to many other endeavors, UNODC works to broadcast these announcements on local television and radio stations across the world. By providing regular access to information regarding human-trafficking, individuals are educated how to protect themselves and their families from being exploited.
The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT) was conceived to promote the global fight on human trafficking, on the basis of international agreements reached at the UN. UN.GIFT was launched in March 2007 by UNODC with a grant made on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. It is managed in cooperation with the International Labour Organization (ILO); the International Organization for Migration (IOM); the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF); the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
Within UN.GIFT, UNODC launched a research exercise to gather primary data on national responses to trafficking in persons worldwide. This exercise resulted in the publication of the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons in February 2009. The report gathers official information for 155 countries and territories in the areas of legal and institutional framework, criminal justice response and victim assistance services. UN.GIFT works with all stakeholders — governments, business, academia, civil society and the media — to support each other's work, create new partnerships, and develop effective tools to fight human trafficking.
The Global Initiative is based on a simple principle: human trafficking is a crime of such magnitude and atrocity that it cannot be dealt with successfully by any government alone. This global problem requires a global, multi-stakeholder strategy that builds on national efforts throughout the world. To pave the way for this strategy, stakeholders must coordinate efforts already underway, increase knowledge and awareness, provide technical assistance, promote effective rights-based responses, build capacity of state and non-state stakeholders, foster partnerships for joint action, and above all, ensure that everybody takes responsibility for this fight. By encouraging and facilitating cooperation and coordination, UN.GIFT aims to create synergies among the anti-trafficking activities of UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders to develop the most efficient and cost-effective tools and good practices.
UN.GIFT aims to mobilize state and non-state actors to eradicate human trafficking by reducing both the vulnerability of potential victims and the demand for exploitation in all its forms, ensuring adequate protection and support to those who fall victim, and supporting the efficient prosecution of the criminals involved, while respecting the fundamental human rights of all persons. In carrying out its mission, UN.GIFT will increase the knowledge and awareness on human trafficking, promote effective rights-based responses, build capacity of state and non-state actors, and foster partnerships for joint action against human trafficking. For more information view the UN.GIFT Progress Report 2009.
Further UNODC efforts to motivate action launched the Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking on March 6, 2009, which Mexico launched its own national version of in April 2010. The campaign encourages people to show solidarity with human trafficking victims by wearing the blue heart, similar to how wearing the red ribbon promotes transnational HIV/AIDS awareness. On November 4, 2010, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons to provide humanitarian, legal and financial aid to victims of human trafficking with the aim of increasing the number of those rescued and supported, and broadening the extent of assistance they receive.
In December 2012, UNODC published the new edition of the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons. The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2012 has revealed that 27 per cent of all victims of human trafficking officially detected globally between 2007 and 2010 are children, up 7 per cent from the period 2003 to 2006.
The Global Report recorded victims of 136 different nationalities detected in 118 countries between 2007 and 2010, during which period, 460 different flows were identified. Around half of all trafficking took place within the same region with 27 per cent occurring within national borders. One exception is the Middle East, where most detected victims are East and South Asians. Trafficking victims from East Asia have been detected in more than 60 countries, making them the most geographically dispersed group around the world. There are significant regional differences in the detected forms of exploitation. Countries in Africa and in Asia generally intercept more cases of trafficking for forced labour, while sexual exploitation is somewhat more frequently found in Europe and in the Americas. Additionally, trafficking for organ removal was detected in 16 countries around the world.The Report raises concerns about low conviction rates - 16 per cent of reporting countries did not record a single conviction for trafficking in persons between 2007 and 2010. On a positive note, 154 countries have ratified the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol, of which UNODC is the guardian. Significant progress has been made in terms of legislation, as 83 per cent of countries now have a law that criminalizes trafficking in persons in accordance with the Protocol.
United States.
In 2002, Derek Ellerman and Katherine Chon founded a non-government organization called Polaris Project to combat human trafficking. In 2007, Polaris instituted the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) where callers can report tips and receive information on human trafficking. Polaris' website and hotline informs the public about where cases of suspected human trafficking have occurred within the United States. The website records calls on a map.
In 2007 the U.S. Senate designated January 11 as a National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness in an effort to raise consciousness about this global, national and local issue. In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, President Barack Obama proclaimed January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.
Council of Europe.
On 3 May 2005, the Committee of Ministers adopted the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CETS No. 197). The Convention was opened for signature in Warsaw on 16 May 2005 on the occasion of the 3rd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe. On 24 October 2007, the Convention received its tenth ratification thereby triggering the process whereby it entered into force on 1 February 2008. As of February 2014, the Convention has been ratified by 41 states, with another 3 states having signed but not yet ratified.
While other international instruments already exist in this field, the Council of Europe Convention, the first European treaty in this field, is a comprehensive treaty focusing mainly on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights. It also aims to prevent trafficking and to prosecute traffickers. In addition, the Convention provides for the setting up of an effective and independent monitoring mechanism capable of controlling the implementation of the obligations contained in the Convention.
The Convention is not restricted to Council of Europe member states; non-member states and the European Union also have the possibility of becoming Party to the Convention.
The Convention established a Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) which monitors the implementation of the Convention through country reports. As of 1 March 2013, GRETA has published 17 country reports.
In addition, the European Court of Human Rights of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg has passed judgments concerning trafficking in human beings which violated obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights: Siliadin v. France, judgment of 26 July 2005, and Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, judgment of 7 January 2010.
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In 2003 the OSCE established an anti-trafficking mechanism aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within participating States to tackle it effectively.
The OSCE actions against human trafficking are coordinated by the Office of the Special Representative for Combating the Traffic of Human Beings. In January 2010, Maria Grazia Giammarinaro became the OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. Dr. Giammarinaro (Italy) has been a judge at the Criminal Court of Rome since 1991. She served from 2006 until 2009 in the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security in Brussels, where she was responsible for work to combat human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, as well as for penal aspects of illegal immigration within the unit dealing with the fight against organized crime. During this time, she co-ordinated the Group of Experts on Trafficking in Human Beings of the European Commission. From 2001 to 2006 she was a judge for preliminary investigation in the Criminal Court of Rome. Prior to that, from 1996 she was Head of the Legislative Office and Adviser to the Minister for Equal Opportunities. From 2006 to December 2009 the office was headed by Eva Biaudet, a former Member of Parliament and Minister of Health and Social Services in her native Finland.
The activities of the Office of the Special Representative range from training law enforcement agencies to tackle human trafficking to promoting policies aimed at rooting out corruption and organised crime. The Special Representative also visits countries and can, on their request, support the formation and implementation of their anti-trafficking policies. In other cases the Special Representative provides advice regarding implementation of the decisions on human trafficking, and assists governments, ministers and officials to achieve their stated goals of tackling human trafficking.
The Anti-trafficking Policy Index.
The '3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index' measures the effectiveness of government policies to fight human trafficking based on an evaluation of policy requirements prescribed by the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (2000).
The policy level is evaluated using a five-point scale, where a score of five indicates the best policy practice, while score 1 is the worst. This scale is used to analyze the main three anti-trafficking policy areas: (i) prosecuting (criminalizing) traffickers, (ii) protecting victims, and (iii) preventing the crime of human trafficking. Each sub-index of prosecution, protection and prevention is aggregated to the overall index with an unweighted sum, with the overall index ranging from a score of 3 (worst) to 15 (best). It is available for up to 177 countries over the 2000-2009 period (on an annual basis).
The outcome of the Index shows that anti-trafficking policy has overall improved over the 2000-2009 period. Improvement is most prevalent in the prosecution and prevention areas worldwide. An exception is protection policy, which shows a modest deterioration in recent years.
In 2009 (the most recent year of the evaluation), seven countries demonstrate the highest possible performance in policies for all three dimensions (overall score 15). These countries are Germany, Australia, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Sweden and the US. The second best performing group (overall score 14) consists of France, Norway, South Korea, Croatia, Canada, Austria, Slovenia and Nigeria. The worst performing country in 2009 was North Korea, receiving the lowest score in all dimensions (overall score 3), followed by Somalia.

Trafficking of children.
Trafficking of children involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of children for the purpose of exploitation. The commercial sexual exploitation of children can take many forms, including forcing a child into prostitution or other forms of sexual activity or child pornography. Child exploitation may also involve forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, the removal of organs, illicit international adoption, trafficking for early marriage, recruitment as child soldiers, for use in begging or as athletes (such as child camel jockeys or football players), or for recruitment for cults.
IOM statistics indicate that a significant minority (35%) of trafficked persons it assisted in 2011 were less than 18 years of age, which is roughly consistent with estimates from previous years. It was reported in 2010 that Thailand and Brazil were considered to have the worst child sex trafficking records.
Traffickers in children may take advantage of the parents' extreme poverty. Parents may sell children to traffickers in order to pay off debts or gain income, or they may be deceived concerning the prospects of training and a better life for their children. They may sell their children into labor, sex trafficking, or illegal adoptions.
The adoption process, legal and illegal, when abused can sometimes result in cases of trafficking of babies and pregnant women from developing countries to the West. In David M. Smolin’s papers on child trafficking and adoption scandals between India and the United States, he presents the systemic vulnerabilities in the inter-country adoption system that makes adoption scandals predictable.
Sex trafficking.
[[File:Trafficking of Females.svg|thumb|A world map showing the legislative situation in different countries to prevent female trafficking according to "WomanStats Project".
There is no universally accepted definition of trafficking for sexual exploitation. The term was formerly thought of as the organized movement of people, usually women, between countries and within countries for sex work with the use of physical coercion, deception and bondage through forced debt. However, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (USA), does not require movement for the offence. The issue becomes contentious when the element of coercion is removed from the definition to incorporate facilitating the willing involvement in prostitution. For example, in the United Kingdom, The Sexual Offenses Act 2003 incorporated trafficking for sexual exploitation but did not require those committing the offence to use coercion, deception or force, so that it also includes any person who enters the UK to carry out sex work with consent as having been trafficked. In addition, any minor involved in a commercial sex act in the United States while under the age of 18 qualifies as a trafficking victim, even if no force, fraud or coercion is involved, under the definition of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons, in the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.
Sexual trafficking includes coercing a migrant into a sexual act as a condition of allowing or arranging the migration. Sexual trafficking uses physical or sexual coercion, deception, abuse of power and bondage incurred through forced debt. Trafficked women and children, for instance, are often promised work in the domestic or service industry, but instead are sometimes taken to brothels where they are used in Sex worker, with their passports and other identification papers confiscated. They may be beaten or locked up and promised their freedom only after earning – through prostitution – their purchase price, as well as their travel and visa costs.
The Yogyakarta Principles, a document on international human rights law on sexual orientation and gender identity, also affirms that "States shall (c) establish legal, educational and social measures, service and programs to address factors that increase vulnerability to trafficking, sale and all forms of exploitation, including but not limited to sexual exploitation, on the grounds of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity, including such factors as social exclusion, discrimination, rejection by families or cultural communities, lack of financial independence, homelessness, discriminatory social attitudes leading to low self-esteem, and lack of protection from discrimination in access to housing accommodation, employment and social services.
Sex trafficking victims are generally found in dire circumstances and easily targeted by traffickers. Individuals, circumstances, and situations vulnerable to traffickers include homeless individuals, runaway teens, displaced homemakers, refugees, job seekers, tourists, kidnap victims and drug addicts. While it may seem like trafficked people are the most vulnerable and powerless minorities in a region, victims are consistently exploited from any ethnic and social background.
Traffickers, also known as pimps or madams, exploit vulnerabilities and lack of opportunities, while offering promises of marriage, employment, education, and/or an overall better life. However, in the end, traffickers force the victims to become prostitutes or work in the sex industry Various work in the sex industry includes prostitution, dancing in strip clubs, performing in pornographic films and pornography, and forms of involuntary servitude. Underage sex trafficking victims in the U.S. are often runaways, troubled, and homeless youth.
Human trafficking does not require travel or transport from one location to another, but one form of sex trafficking involves international agents and brokers who arrange travel and job placements for women from one country. Women are lured to accompany traffickers based on promises of lucrative opportunities unachievable in their native country. However, once they reach their destination, the women discover that they have been deceived and learn the true nature of the work that they will be expected to do. Most have been told false information regarding the financial arrangements and conditions of their employment and find themselves in coercive or abusive situations from which escape is both difficult and dangerous. According to a 2009 U.S. Department of Justice report, there were 1,229 suspected human trafficking incidents in the United States from January 2007- September 2008. Of these, 83 percent were sex trafficking cases, though only 9% of all cases could be confirmed as examples of human trafficking.
Profile and modus operandi of traffickers.
Traffickers of young girls into prostitution in India are often women who have been trafficked themselves. As adults they use personal relationships and trust in their villages of origin to recruit additional girls.
In some cases, traffickers approach very vulnerable women (including underage girls) to offer them "legitimate" work or the promise of an opportunity for education. The main types of work offered are in the catering and hotel industry, in bars and clubs, modeling contracts, or au pair work. Traffickers sometimes use offers of marriage, threats, intimidation, and kidnapping as means of obtaining victims. In many cases, the women end up trafficked into the sex industry. Also, some (migrating) prostitutes (See: migrant sex work) can become victims of human trafficking because the women know they will be working as prostitutes, but they are led to have an inaccurate view of the circumstances and the conditions of the work in their country of destination, and consequently get exploited.
In order to obtain control over their victims, traffickers will use force, drugs, emotional tactics and financial methods. On occasion, they will even resort to various forms of violence, such as gang rape and mental and physical abuse. Sometimes, the victims will succumb to Stockholm Syndrome because their captors will pretend to "love" and "need" them, even going so far as promise marriage and future stability. This is particularly effective with younger victims, because they are more inexperienced and therefore easily manipulated.
Profile of victims.
The main motive of a woman (in some cases, an underage girl) to accept an offer from a trafficker is better financial opportunities for herself or her family. A study on the origin countries of trafficking confirms that most trafficking victims are not the poorest in their countries of origin, and sex trafficking victims are likely to be women from countries with some freedom to travel alone and some economic freedom.
Combating sex trafficking.
International institutions and legislation.
History of international legislation.
International pressure to address trafficking in women and children became a growing part of the social Reform movement in the United States and Europe during the late 19th century. International legislation against the trafficking of women and children began with the conclusion of an international convention in 1901, followed by conclusion of the International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic in 1904. (The latter was revised in 1910.) These conventions were ratified by 34 countries. The first formal international research into the scope of the problem was funded by American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, through the American Bureau of Social Hygiene. In 1923, a committee from the bureau was tasked with investigating trafficking in 28 countries, interviewing approximately 5,000 informants and analyzing information over two years before issuing its final report. This was the first formal report on trafficking in women and children to be issued by an official body.
The League of Nations, formed in 1919, took over as the international coordinator of legislation intended to end the trafficking of women and children. An international Conference on White Slave Traffic was held in 1921, attended by the 34 countries that ratified the 1901 and 1904 conventions. Another convention against trafficking was ratified by League members in 1922, and like the 1904 international convention, this one required ratifying countries to submit annual reports on their progress in tackling the problem. Compliance with this requirement was not complete, although it gradually improved: in 1924, approximately 34% of the member countries submitted reports as required, which rose to 46% in 1929, 52% in 1933, and 61% in 1934. The 1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children was sponsored by the League of Nations.
United Nations.
In 1949, the first international protocol dealing with sex slavery was the 1949 UN Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and Exploitation of Prostitution of Others. This convention followed the abolitionist idea of sex trafficking as incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person. Serving as a model for future legislation, the 1949 UN Convention was not ratified by every country, but came into force in 1951. These early efforts led to the 2000 Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, mentioned above. These instruments contain the elements of the current international law on trafficking in humans.
In 2011, the United Nations reported that girl victims made up two thirds of all trafficked children. Girls constituted 15 to 20 per cent of the total number of all detected victims, including adults, whereas boys comprised about 10 per cent, said the Report, which was based on official data supplied by 132 countries. 
Current international treaties include the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages, entered into force in 1964.
In the United States.
Up until the early 1960s, when racism was a major issue in the US, Congress was concerned about White slavery. The result of this fear was the White Slave Traffic Act of 1910 (better known as the Mann Act), which criminalized interracial marriage and banned single women from crossing state borders for morally wrong acts. In 1914, of the women arrested for crossing state borders under this act, 70% were charged with voluntary prostitution. Once the idea of a sex slave shifted from a White woman to an enslaved woman from countries in poverty, the US began passing immigration acts to curtail aliens from entering the country among other reasons. Several acts such as the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and Immigration Act of 1924 were passed to prevent emigrants from Europe and Asia from entering the United States. Following the banning of immigrants during the 1920s, human trafficking was not seen as a major issue until the 1990s.
At 18 U.S.C. § 1591, or the Commercial Sex Act, the US makes it illegal to recruit, entice, obtain, provide, move or harbor a person or to benefit from such activities knowing that the person will be caused to engage in commercial sex acts where the person is under 18 or where force, fraud or coercion exists.
Under the Bush Administration, fighting sex slavery worldwide and domestically became a priority with an average of $100 million spent per year, which substantially outnumbers the amount spent by other countries. Before President Bush took office, Congress had passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA). The TVPA strengthened services to victims of violence, law enforcements ability to reduce violence against women and children, and education against human trafficking. Also specified in the TVPA was a mandate to collect funds for the treatment of sex trafficking victims that provided shelter, food, education, and financial grants. Internationally, the TVPA set standards that governments of other countries must follow in order to receive aid from the U.S. to fight human trafficking. Once George W. Bush took office in 2001, restricting sex trafficking became one of his primary humanitarian efforts. The Attorney General under President Bush, John Ashcroft, strongly enforced the TVPA. The Act was subsequently renewed in 2004, 2006, and 2008. It established two stipulations an applicant has to meet in order to receive the benefits of a T-Visa. First, a trafficked victim must prove/admit to being trafficked and second must submit to prosecution of his or her trafficker. In 2011, Congress failed to re-authorize the Act. The State Department publishes an annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which examines the progress that the U.S. and other countries have made in destroying human trafficking businesses, arresting the kingpins, and rescuing the victims.
Council of Europe.
Complementary protection is ensured through the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (Lanzarote, 25 October 2007).
Other government actions.
Actions taken to combat human trafficking vary from government to government. Some government actions include 
Raising awareness can take three forms. First, governments can raise awareness amongst potential victims, particularly in countries where human traffickers are active. Second, they can raise awareness amongst the police, social welfare workers and immigration officers to equip them to deal appropriately with the problem. And finally, in countries where prostitution is legal or semi-legal, they can raise awareness amongst the clients of prostitution so that they can watch for signs of human trafficking victims. Methods to raise general awareness often include television programs, documentary films, internet communications, and posters. and posters.
Many countries have come under criticism for inaction, or ineffective action. Criticisms include the failure of governments to properly identify and protect trafficking victims, enactment of immigration policies which potentially re-victimize trafficking victims, and insufficient action in helping prevent vulnerable populations from becoming trafficking victims. A particular criticism has been the reluctance of some countries to tackle trafficking for purposes other than sex.
Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
Many NGOs work on the issue of sex trafficking. One major NGO is the International Justice Mission (IJM). IJM is a U.S.-based non-profit human rights organization that combats human trafficking in developing countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. IJM states that it is a “human rights agency that brings rescue to victims of slavery, sexual exploitation, and other forms of violent oppression.” It is a faith-based organization since its purported goal is to “restore to victims of oppression the things that God intends for them: their lives, their liberty, their dignity, the fruits of their labor.” The IJM receives over $900,000 from the U.S. government. The organization has two methods for rescuing victims: brothel raids in cooperation with local police, and "buy bust" operations in which undercover agencies pretend to purchase sex services of an underage girl. After the raid and rescue, the women are sent to rehabilitation programs run by NGOs (such as churches) or the government. 
Campaigns and initiatives.
The Demi and Ashton (DNA) Foundation was created by celebrity humanitarians Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher in 2009 in their efforts to fight human trafficking (specifically focusing on sex trafficking of children) in the U.S. In September 2010, the pair announced the launch of their “Real Men Don't Buy Girls” campaign to combat child sex trafficking alongside other Hollywood stars and technology companies like Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook. "Real Men Don't Buy Girls" is based on the idea that high-profile men speaking out against child sex trafficking can help reduce the demand for young girls in the commercial sex trade. A press conference was held on September 23 at the Clinton Global Initiative. In 1994 Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women was established to combat trafficking in women in any grounds. In addition to campaigns led by high profile celebrities, the popular TV channel MTV started a campaign of their own to combat sex trafficking. The initiative called “MTV Exit” joined forces with Facebook to raise awareness in South Asia. MTV had hopes of educating young girls about sex trafficking via social media. The purpose of the campaign was to not only raise awareness but also to educate young women on human trafficking. Young children, and often women who come from countries that are not as advanced and developed as the United States, are in most cases more susceptible to be victims of this particular crime. The Internet may provide a line of communication when no other means of communication are available between countries.
While globalization fostered new technologies that may exacerbate sex trafficking, technology can also be used to assist law enforcement and anti-trafficking efforts. A study was done on online classified ads surrounding the Super Bowl. A number of reports have noticed increase in sex trafficking during previous years of the Super Bowl. For the 2011 Super Bowl held in Dallas, Texas, the Back page for Dallas area experienced a 136% increase on the number of posts in the Adult section on Super Bowl Sunday, where as Sundays typically have the lowest amount of posts. Researchers analyzed the most salient terms in these online ads, which suggested that many escorts were traveling across state lines to Dallas specifically for the Super Bowl, and found that the self-reported ages were higher than usual. Twitter was another social networking platform studied for detecting sex trafficking. Digital tools can be used to narrow the pool of sex trafficking cases, albeit imperfectly and with uncertainty.
'End Demand'.
End Demand refers to the strategy and efforts of different institutions that seek to end sex trafficking by eliminating and criminalizing the demand for commercial sex. End Demand is very popular in some countries including the United States and Canada. Proponents of the end demand strategy support initiatives such as "John's schools" that rehabilitate johns, increased arrests of johns, and public shaming (e.g. billboards and websites that publicly name johns who were caught). John's Schools were pioneered in San Francisco in 1995 and now used in many cities across the U.S. as well as other countries such as the UK and Canada. Some compare John's Schools programs to driver's safety courses, because first offenders can pay a fee to attend class(es) on the harms of prostitution, and upon completion, the charges against the john will be dropped. Another initiative that seeks to end demand is the cross-country tour "Ignite the Road to Justice," launched by the 2011 Miss Canada, Tara Teng. Teng's initiative circulates a petition to end the demand for commercial sex that drives prostitution and sex trafficking. End Demand efforts also include large-scale public awareness campaigns. Campaigns have started in Sweden, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Atlanta, Georgia. The Atlanta campaign in 2006 was titled "Dear John," and ran ads in local media reaching out to potential johns to discourage them from buying sex. Massachusetts and Rhode Island also had legislative efforts that criminalized prostitution and increased end demand efforts by targeting johns.
Sweden criminalized the buying of sex in 1999, and Norway and Iceland have later introduced similar laws. The laws were aimed at combating trafficking. Iceland also banned strip clubs in 2010.
Measures of human trafficking and efforts.
There are many different estimates of how large the human trafficking and sex trafficking industries are. According to scholar Kevin Bales, author of Disposable People (2004), estimates that as many as 27 million people are in "modern-day slavery" across the globe. In 2008, the U.S. Department of State estimates that 2 million children are exploited by the global commercial sex trade. In the same year, a study classified 12.3 million individuals worldwide as “forced laborers, bonded laborers or sex-trafficking victims.” Approximately 1.39 million of these individuals worked as commercial sex slaves, with women and girls comprising 98%, or 1.36 million, of this population.
The enactment of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (TVPA) in 2000 by the United States Congress and its subsequent re-authorizations established the Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, which engages with foreign governments to fight human trafficking and publishes a Trafficking in Persons Report annually. The Trafficking in Persons Report evaluates each country's progress in anti-trafficking and places each country onto one of three tiers based on their governments' efforts to comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking as prescribed by the TVPA.
In particular, there were three main components of the TVPA, commonly called the three P’s:
PROTECTION: The TVPA increased the U.S. Government’s efforts to protect trafficked foreign national victims including, but not limited to:
Victims of trafficking, many of whom were previously ineligible for government assistance, were provided assistance; and a non-immigrant status for victims of trafficking if they cooperated in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers (T-Visas, as well as providing other mechanisms to ensure the continued presence of victims to assist in such investigations and prosecutions).
PROSECUTION: The TVPA authorized the U.S. Government to strengthen efforts to prosecute traffickers including, but not limited to: Creating a series of new crimes on trafficking, forced labor, and document servitude that supplemented existing limited crimes related to slavery and involuntary servitude; and recognizing that modern-day slavery takes place in the context of fraud and coercion, as well as force, and is based on new clear definitions for both trafficking into sexual exploitation and labor exploitation: Sex trafficking was defined as, “a commercial sex act that is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age. Labor trafficking was defined as, “the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.
PREVENTION: The TVPA allowed for increased prevention measures including, but not limited to: Authorizing the U.S. Government to assist foreign countries with their efforts to combat trafficking, as well as address trafficking within the United States, including through research and awareness-raising; and providing foreign countries with assistance in drafting laws to prosecute trafficking, creating programs for trafficking victims, and assistance with implementing effective means of investigation.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton later identified a fourth P, “partnership,” in 2009 to serve as a, “pathway to progress in the effort against modern-day slavery.”6
Structural factors.
A complex set of factors fuel sex trafficking, including poverty, unemployment, social norms that discriminate against women, demand for commercial sex, institutional challenges, and globalization.
Poverty and globalization.
Poverty and lack of educational and economic opportunities in one's hometown may lead women to voluntarily migrate and then be involuntarily trafficked into sex work. As globalization opened up national borders to greater exchange of goods and capital, labor migration also increased. Less wealthy countries have fewer options for livable wages. The economic impact of globalization pushes people to make conscious decisions to migrate and be vulnerable to trafficking. Gender inequalities that hinder women from participating in the formal sector also push women into informal sectors.
Long waiting lists for organs in the United States and Europe created a thriving international black market. Traffickers harvest organs, particularly kidneys, to sell for large profit and often without properly caring for or compensating the victims. Victims often come from poor, rural communities and see few other options than to sell organs illegally. Wealthy countries' inability to meet organ demand within their own borders perpetuates trafficking. By reforming their internal donation system, Iran achieved a surplus of legal donors and provides an instructive model for eliminating both organ trafficking and -shortage.
Globalization and the rise of internet technology has also facilitated sex trafficking. Online classified sites and social networks such as Craigslist have been under intense scrutiny for being used by johns and traffickers in facilitating sex trafficking and sex work in general. Traffickers use explicit sites and underground sites (e.g. Craigslist, Backpage, MySpace) to market, recruit, sell, and exploit females. Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites are suspected for similar uses. For example, Randal G. Jennings was convicted of sex trafficking five underage girls by forcing them to advertise on Craigslist and driving them to meet the johns. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, online classified ads reduce the risks of finding prospective customers. Studies have identified the internet as the single biggest facilitator of commercial sex trade, although it is difficult to ascertain which women advertised are sex trafficking victims. Traffickers and pimps use the internet to recruit minors, since internet and social networking sites usage have significantly increased especially among children.
Organized criminals can generate up to several thousand dollars per day from one trafficked girl, and the internet has further increased profitability of sex trafficking and child trafficking. With faster access to a wider clientele, more sexual encounters can be scheduled. Victims and clients, according a New York City report on sex trafficking in minors, increasingly use the internet to meet customers. Due to protests, Craigslist has since closed its adult services section. According to authorities, Backpage is now the main source for advertising trafficking victims. Investigators also frequently browse online classified ads to identify potential underage girls who are trafficked.
While globalization fostered new technologies that may exacerbate sex trafficking, technology can also be used to assist law enforcement and anti-trafficking efforts. A study was done on online classified ads surrounding the Super Bowl. A number of reports have noticed increase in sex trafficking during previous years of the Super Bowl. For the 2011 Super Bowl held in Dallas, Texas, the Backpage for Dallas area experienced a 136% increase on the number of posts in the Adult section on Super Bowl Sunday, where as Sundays typically have the lowest amount of posts. Researchers analyzed the most salient terms in these online ads, which suggested that many escorts were traveling across state lines to Dallas specifically for the Super Bowl, and found that the self-reported ages were higher than usual. Twitter was another social networking platform studied for detecting sex trafficking. Digital tools can be used to narrow the pool of sex trafficking cases, albeit imperfectly and with uncertainty. 
However, there has been no evidence found actually linking the Super Bowl - or any other sporting event - to increased trafficking or prostitution.
Political and institutional challenges.
Corrupt and inadequately trained police officers can be complicit in sex trafficking and/or commit violence against sex workers, including sex trafficked victims.
Anti-trafficking agendas from different groups can also be in conflict. In the movement for sex workers rights, sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking themselves. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has "self-regulatory boards" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations. Critics argue that since sex trafficking is an economic and violent crime, it calls for law enforcement to intervene and prevent violence against victims.
Criminalization of sex work also may foster the underground market for sex work and enable sex trafficking.
Difficult political situations such as civil war and social conflict are push factors for migration and trafficking. A study reported that larger countries, the richest and the poorest countries, and countries with restricted press freedom are likely to engage in more sex trafficking. Specifically, being in a transitional economy made a country nineteen times more likely to be ranked in the highest trafficking category, and gender inequalities in a country's labor market also correlated with higher trafficking rates.
An annual US State Department report in June 2013 cited Russia and China as among the worst offenders in combatting forced labour and sex trafficking, raising the possibility of US sanctions being leveraged against these countries.
In 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada declared the laws which effectively prohibited prostitution illegal. It delayed the implementation of this ruling for one year to give the parliament time to enact replacement laws, if it so desired.
Social norms.
Women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of social norms that marginalize their value and status in society. Females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead people to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma, further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. Various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.
Demand for commercial sex.
Abolitionists who seek an end to sex trafficking explain the nature of sex trafficking as an economic supply and demand model. In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.
Consequences.
Consequences for victims.
Sex trafficking victims face threats of violence from many sources, including customers, pimps, brothel owners, madams, traffickers, and corrupt local law enforcement officials. Raids as an anti-sex trafficking measure severely impact sex trafficked victims. Due to their complicated legal status and their language barriers, the arrest or fear of arrest creates stress and other emotional trauma for trafficking victims. Victims may also experience physical violence from law enforcement during raids.
Trafficking victims are also exposed to different psychological stressors. They suffer social alienation in the host and home countries. Stigmatization, social exclusion, and intolerance make reintegration into local communities difficult. The governments offer little assistance and social services to trafficked victims upon their return. As the victims are also pushed into drug trafficking, many of them face criminal sanctionoso.
Economic impacts.
According to estimates from the International Labour Organization (ILO), every year the human trafficking industry generates 32 billion USD, half of which ($15.5 billion) is made in industrialized countries, and a third of which ($9.7 billion) is made in Asia. A 2011 paper published in "Human Rights Review", “Sex Trafficking: Trends, Challenges and Limitations of International Law,” notes that, since 2000, the number of sex-trafficking victims has risen while costs associated with trafficking have declined: “Coupled with the fact that trafficked sex slaves are the single most profitable type of slave, costing on average $1,895 each but generating $29,210 annually, are stark predictions about the likely growth in commercial sex slavery in the future.” Sex trafficking victims rarely get a share of the money that they make through coerced sex work, which further keeps them oppressed.
Criticism.
Both the human trafficking discourse and the actions undertaken by the anti-human traffickers have been criticized by some scholars. and journalists The criticism touches upon three main themes: 1) statistics and data on human trafficking; 2) the concept itself; 3) the anti-trafficking measures.
Problems with statistics and data.
Numerous NGOs and governmental agencies produce estimates and specific statistics on the numbers of potential and actual victims of trafficking. According to the critics, these figures rarely have identifiable sources or transparent methodologies behind them and in most (if not all) instances, they are mere guesses. Scholars argue that this is a result of the fact that it is impossible to produce any meaningful statistics on a reportedly illegal and covert phenomenon happening in the shadow economy. Others argue that many of these statistics are inflated to aid advocacy of anti-trafficking NGOs and the anti-trafficking policies of governments. Due to the definition of trafficking as a process (not a singly defined act) and the fact that it is a dynamic phenomenon with constantly shifting patterns relating to economic circumstances, much of the statistical evaluation is flawed.
Problems with the concept.
According to some scholars, the very concept of human trafficking is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: ‘would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt’. One scholar says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.
The critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by illegal migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of some evil trafficking networks. Tara McCormack believes that the whole trafficking discourse can actually be detrimental to the interests of migrants as it denies them agency and as it depoliticizes debates on migration.
The international Save the Children organization also stated: "... The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se. ... trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other. ... On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti-trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution."
Some critics claim that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ the 'politics of pity,' which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering. One critic identifies two strategies that gain pity: denunciation - attributing all violence and suffering to the perpetrator - and sentiment - exclusively depicting the suffering of the women. NGOs' use of images of unidentifiable females suffering physically help display sex trafficking scenarios as all the same. However, critics point out that not all trafficking victims have been abducted, abused physically, and repeatedly raped, unlike popular portrayals.
Problems with anti-trafficking measures.
Groups like Amnesty International have been critical of insufficient or ineffective government measures to tackle human trafficking. Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking - identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government’s new anti-trafficking measures as 'not fit for purpose'.
Victim identification and protection in the UK.
In the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status. High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the asylum system is linked to the trafficking victim protection system.
Laura Agustin has suggested that in some cases 'anti-traffickers' ascribe victim status to immigrants who have made conscious and rational decisions to cross the borders knowing they will be selling sex and who do not consider themselves to be victims. There have been instances in which the alleged victims of trafficking have actually refused to be rescued or run away from the anti-trafficking shelters.
In a 2013, the Court of Appeal gave guidance to prosecuting authorities on the prosecution of victims of human trafficking, and held that the convictions of 3 Vietnamese children and one Ugandan woman ought to be quashed as the proceedings amounted to an abuse of the court's process. The case was reported by the BBC and one of the victims was interviewed by Channel 4.
Law enforcement and the use of raids.
In the U.S., services and protections for trafficked victims are related to cooperation with law enforcement. Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle "criminal networks," and to rescue victims from abuse.
Critics, however, argue that anti-trafficking raids in the U.S. are misguided and do more harm than good to the victims, as well as being ineffective in holding traffickers accountable. Private actors who conduct raids are criticized because of their lack of experience and expertise in identifying actual victims and their lack of capacity to provide legal and social services for people rescued from raids.
The problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.
Law enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful. 
Social workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.
As raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.
Critics suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, critics suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model.
End Demand programs.
Critics argue that End Demand programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, "John's Schools" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers due to the higher risk nature of their work. The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of John's Schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some John's Schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John's Schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.
Alternative perspectives.
Third-Way Feminism.
The third-way feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on "sexualized domination," which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic in that it overrides consent of individuals.
Third-way feminism harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-way feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-way feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-way feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.
Third-way feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to Amartya Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims. Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.

<doc id="19333696" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19333696" title="Münzmeister">
Münzmeister

In medieval and early modern Germany, the Münzmeister ("mint master", the Latin term is "monetarius") was the director or administrator of a mint, a moneyer with responsibility for the minting of coins, or specie. His duties were defined differently at different locations and ages.
Middle ages.
The need for currency was relatively low during Merovingian times. The "Münzmeister" produced coins in small workshops, working alone or with the aid of a few assistants, and handled the precious metals required. During Carolingian times, minting of specie became the task of royally appointed officials.
During the High Middle Ages they were replaced by the "Münzerhausgenossenschaft", or minting house cooperative. Its members came from the ranks of rich burghers: usually merchants, precious-metal traders, moneychangers, goldsmiths, who in turn appointed one out of their ranks as "Münzmeister". For their labor, the members of the cooperative were due a share of the minting profits. They also enjoyed certain rights and privileges, including a monopoly on the purchase of gold and silver, exemption from customs duties and taxes, and independent jurisdiction in minting matters. The house cooperatives saw their heyday in the 13th and 14th centuries.
In the late Middle Ages, the minting house cooperatives vanished when minting was taken over by sovereigns or cities. The "Münzmeister" was now an entrepreneur who determined weight, precious-metal content, seignorage and their own share, by way of free negotiations with the principals. Next to mines and shipyards, mints had become the largest enterprises of the age.
Modern era.
In modernity, local entrepreneurs and their mints gained in importance. The era saw the rise of "Münzmeister" dynasties, with leases that were extended over several generations. Frequently the coins bear symbols engraved by the "Münzmeister", often as tiny rosettae, tools, monographs or initials. In the 17th and 18th century the number of Jewish leaseholders in minting increased, not least because access of Jews to other occupations became more restricted on religious grounds.
During the Habsburg era in Austria and Germany, the government soon began to establish a minting system. Austria created the office of a supreme heritable "Münzmeister" that provided for a sinecure without a share in profits. In Bohemia, too, the supreme office of "Münzmeister" was held by dukes and noblemen who at the same time supervised all the kingdom's mining facilities.
Besides the "Münzmeister", there were other minting officials, such as the master smith, the dye-cutter, and the minter. The Münzwardein (in Latin, "wardinus") was tasked with making sure that minting was done properly from the right alloy. He also had to take samples that were presented to the "Probationstag" (= sampling commission) in line with official regulations. The sampling commission was constituted from the royal court or local gentry or their repreesentatives.

Churchill Chine is a geological feature on the south west coast of the Isle of Wight, England. It is west of the village of Brook and just east of Hanover Point. It is a small sandy coastal gully, one of a number of such chines on the island created by stream erosion of soft Cretaceous rocks. It leads from the 30 foot high clifftop to the beach of Brook Bay.
The Chine carries water from a lake about 100m to the north, just across the nearby Military Road and also from a small brook that runs down the hillside from Dunsbury. The gully contains a small waterfall which drops drop to the beach.
The Isle of Wight Coastal Path crosses the top of the chine via a small footbridge.

United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland

The United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland or more formally, the "Special Envoy of the President and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland" is the top U.S. diplomat supporting the Northern Ireland peace process.
Origins.
Traditionally U.S. leaders were reluctant to get involved in the Troubles in Northern Ireland, viewing it primarily as an internal matter of the United Kingdom. However when Bill Clinton became U.S. President that changed. When Clinton was on the campaign trail as the Democratic candidate for President in 1992, he suggested both orally and in a letter to Congressman Bruce Morrison that he would favor the appointment of a Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Clinton was not alone in supporting a more active U.S. involvement in Northern Ireland. On February 23, 1993, shortly after Clinton assumed office as President, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy, together with 16 co-sponsors, sponsored a Congressional Resolution calling for the appointment of a Special Envoy. The Resolution called that it be:
However, the proposed Resolution initially came to nothing. Nevertheless, Clinton discussed the prospect of appointing a Special Envoy with the Irish premier, Albert Reynolds when the two leaders first met on St. Patrick's Day in 1993. However Clinton deferred any appointment. When the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) declared a ceasefire in 1994, Sinn Féin party leader, Gerry Adams urged Washington to play a "nudging role" as it did in South Africa and the Middle East. Congressman Bruce Morrison was considered a potential candidate.
George Mitchell.
It was not until 1995 that a decision to appoint a Special Envoy was finally made. The announcement of the appointment of former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell as Special Envoy initially "infuriated" the UK government. Mitchell was recognised as being more than a token envoy but someone representing a President with a deep interest in events. However, around the time of Mitchell's appointment, it was agreed with both the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom John Major and his Irish counterpart John Bruton that Mitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of paramilitary groups. Mitchell went on to successfully chair the talks that resulted in the Belfast Agreement (also known as the "Good Friday Agreement").
Later Envoys.
The United States has continued to support the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and has demonstrated its readiness to assist the process in any way. On June 10, 2003, President George W. Bush announced his intention to designate Ambassador Richard N. Haass as the Special Envoy. Haass was an active Envoy. In 2001, within a week of the September 11 attacks, Haass warned Irish Republicans that the suspected links between the IRA and Colombian terrorist groups could have "potentially serious consequences for the role of the United States in the peace process". Later, Haass attacked then Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble for setting a deadline for pulling out of power-sharing, accusing him of adding to a sense of crisis.
Later, Mitchell Reiss was appointed as the Special Envoy. At the invitation of the British and Irish governments, Special Envoy Reiss participated in the peace process negotiations that took place at Leeds Castle in 2004. On February 15, 2007, Paula Dobriansky, U.S. Undersecretary for Democracy and Global Affairs at the State Department, was designated the U.S. Envoy for Northern Ireland. The transition from the former Special Envoy, Ambassador Mitchell Reiss, took place on February 15, 2007. In February 2008, Special Envoy Dobriansky led a trade mission to Belfast.
Each of the Special Envoys has periodically reported to U.S. Congressional Committees on their activities and the status of the Northern Ireland peace process and other matters concerning Northern Ireland.
Future.
The United States has at times contemplated whether to terminate the position of U.S. Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. In 2001, then U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell stated in response to questions that:
During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign in the United States, Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama was reported in "The Irish Times" as having questioned the necessity to keep a U.S. Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. This drew a robust response from the Republican Party candidate, Senator John McCain, who strongly backed retaining a U.S. Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. The Senator criticised Senator Obama's position as demonstrating a willingness:

Sir John Curzon, 1st Baronet

Sir John Curzon, 1st Baronet (c. 1599 – 13 December 1686) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons of England from 1640 to 1648. He supported the parliamentarian cause during the English Civil War
Curzon was the son of John Curzon of Kedleston Hall (High Sheriff of Derbyshire 1609),and his wife Millicent Sacheveral, daughter of Sir Ralph Sacheverel of Staunton, and widow of Thomas Gell of Hopton. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford on 12 June 1618, aged 18 and was a student of the Inner Temple in 1620.

Languages of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands

The only official language of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is English, and this is spoken by almost everyone on a day to day basis. The islands' population is currently transient, and there never were any native South Georgians, although a handful of people have been born there.
Current.
English language.
English has been used throughout the recorded history of South Georgia, from the earliest explorations by Anthony de la Roché and James Cook to the present day. It is used for the territory's administration, postage stamps and various other purposes.
The majority of the area's toponyms are either in English or anglicised, and have been given by both British and American explorers - e.g. Bird Island, Grass Island, Echo Pass, Gold Harbour and many others.
Latin.
Latin is used in the motto of the islands - "Leo Terram Propriam Protegat" meaning "May the Lion protect his own land". It also appears on the church at Grytviken.
Historic.
Several languages have been used historically in South Georgia.
Norwegian.
Norwegian was used in South Georgia mainly by the numerous whalers.
Norwegian's main legacy is in a sizeable number of placenames, including Hestesletten ("Horse's Plain"), Skrap Skerries ("skrapskjaer" or "skrapskjar"), Trollhul and Elsehul. A couple of whaling stations had Norwegian names- Husvik (house bay) and Godthul (good hollow).
The first person to be born in South Georgia (and south of the Antarctic Convergence), Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen would have been a Norwegian speaker. The settlement Grytviken (which is a "Swedish" name) was founded by Carl Anton Larsen, another Norwegian speaker.
Russian.
Russian was used by some explorers, such as Bellinghausen, and is retained in placenames such as Visokoi Island ("высокий" meaning "high"), Zavodovski and Kupriyanov Islands ("Mys Kupriyanov") and Annenkov Island.
Spanish.
The role of Spanish is more controversial, particularly as Argentina still contests the British claim to the islands, and considers them part of the Tierra del Fuego province.
The Compañía Argentina de Pesca operated in Grytviken until about 1960.
The Argentine naval station Corbeta Uruguay was clandestinely built on Thule Island, South Sandwich Islands on 7 November 1976, in the wake of many protests. At an early stage of the Falklands War, 32 special forces troops from Corbeta Uruguay were brought by the Argentine Navy ship "Bahía Paraiso" to South Georgia and landed at Leith Harbour on March 25, 1982. During this period, Argentina would have used Spanish "officially". However, Argentine control was not complete, and the Argentines in South Georgia surrendered to the British on April 25, 1982.
Spanish does not feature much in the official toponomy of the islands, other than the names of scientific bases, and Carlita Bay; however, a number of placenames have Spanish equivalents, e.g. Vindication Island is "Isla Vindicación".
Swedish language.
Swedish is closely related to and often mutually intelligible with Norwegian.
The placenames Grytviken (Pot Bay) and Maiviken (Majviken -May Bay) derive from Swedish.
Others.
Numerous other languages would have been used by explorers, whalers, sealers etc. in the vicinity, these would include Lowland Scots (along with some Scottish placenames), and German (retained in placenames such as Bertrab Glacier and Brocken).

Hedgehog Engine

Hedgehog Engine is a game engine developed by Sonic Team.
Features.
Hedgehog Engine is capable of rendering high quality graphics with low performance costs. It makes use of modern illumination methods like Global Illumination and Dynamic Shadows.
Development.
Sonic Team began development of the core of a new engine in 2005, to be used in the next Sonic games. With the announcement of Sonic Unleashed in 2008, Sonic Team stated that the game was made with that newly developed engine, christened Hedgehog Engine, which was intended for current generation consoles, and was capable of modern graphical features. The Playstation 2 version of Sonic Unleashed was made in another engine, due to Playstation 2 lacks of resources to be able to run any Hedgehog Engine game.
Later on, Sonic Team stated that Sonic Generations would make use of Hedgehog Engine, and that the game would be making its way to the Microsoft Windows platform, as well as the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, marking the debut of the engine on PCs.
During the development of Phantasy Star Online 2, Sonic Team stated that the game would make use of Hedgehog Engine, and it would be exclusive for PCs. This is the first time that a Phantasy Star game would not be present on Consoles.
The Wii U version of Sonic Lost World also uses the Hedgehog Engine.

Crosby Scout and Guide Marina Club

The Crosby Scout and Guide Marina Club, established in 1973, is a sailing and canoeing club located at Crosby Marina, in Cambridge Road, Waterloo, Merseyside, at the northern end of the Seaforth Freeport container terminal.
Crosby Marina.
Crosby Marina, a man-made marina of some , is bounded by the Mersey Estuary to the west, Liverpool Freeport and Seaforth Nature Reserve to the South, and a predominately residential area to the east. It is separated from the River Mersey by a sea wall, topped by a promenade overlooking Crosby Beach, and sand dunes around wide. The prevailing wind is westerly. The marina is about deep, and was constructed on land reclaimed from the sea when the adjacent Seaforth Freeport container base was built.
The premises occupied since 1974 were recently demolished in 2008 to make way for a new Crosby Water Centre, which was due for completion in Summer 2009. The opening was delayed with a fall-out between Sefton Council and the trust that was originally to run the new centre. In the meantime the club used several temporary portakabins as a clubhouse and changing rooms.
In October 2009, the club moved into the new building, which is now to be known as the Crosby Lakeside Adventure Centre, where it will use the new amenities along with designated new changing rooms and shower facilities.
About the Club.
The club runs a dinghy section, sailing a variety of craft - Wayfarer, GP14s, Enterprise, RS Fevas, Herons, Gulls, Toppers - and a kayak section. It is run by the Scout and Guide movements, but not exclusively for scouts and guides, and draws its membership from local youngsters aged 10 to about 20 years.

Colt Police Positive Special

Introduced to the firearms market in 1908, The Colt Police Positive Special is a small frame, double-action revolver with a six round cylinder, primarily chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, designed and manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company. The Police Positive Special was intended primarily for sale to law enforcement agencies and enjoys the distinction of being Colt’s most widely produced revolver design with over 750,000 built.
Development and history.
The Police Positive Special was an iterative improvement of Colt's earlier Police Positive model, the only differences being a slightly lengthened cylinder and elongated and strengthened frame to allow the chambering of the longer, more powerful .32-20 Winchester and .38 Special cartridges. In the early 20th century the Colt Positive and Positive Special teamed with Colt's other admired model, the Official Police, to capture the lion's share of the law enforcement firearms market. Very popular with law enforcement officers due to its light weight, the Positive Special went through a number of series or “issues”. The first issue ran from introduction to 1927 and had the early 1900-era distinctive Colt black hard rubber grips. The second issue introduced wooden grips which were smooth in the early years, later giving way to a checkered style, also the smooth topstrap was replaced with a serrated one. The Third issue began in 1947, and the Fourth issue in 1977 introduced a Colt Python-style shrouded ejector-rod housing. Production of the Police Positive Special ended in 1995.
Features.
Produced with fine carbon steel, the Positive Special featured Colt’s characteristic highly polished surfaces and was available with Colt's signature bright royal blued finish as well as a nickel plated veneer. Built on Colt’s “D” frame, it was offered in four, five, and six inch barreled models, weighing a scant 23 ounces in the four inch. The Positive Special also incorporated Colt’s “Positive Lock” safety which preventing the firing pin from hitting the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. Intended to address deficiencies of earlier models such as the Single Action Army, Colt's Positive Lock prevented an accidental discharge even if the lowered hammer was struck or the pistol was dropped, allowing the revolver to be safely carried with all six chambers loaded. The pistol’s sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s topstrap.
Trivia.
The Colt Police Positive was the pistol that the President of Brazil, Getúlio Vargas, used to commit suicide in 1954. He was in his bedroom in the presidential residence at that time, which was called Palácio do Catete, in Rio de Janeiro.

<doc id="19334116" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19334116" title="Luna (Serbian band)">
Luna (Serbian band)

Luna (Serbian Cyrillic: Луна; trans. "The Moon") was a Serbian and former Yugoslav post-punk/gothic rock band from Novi Sad.
Formed on the ashes of the New Wave band La Strada and getting the name by the Bernardo Bertolucci film "La Luna", Luna quickly gained the public's attention and established a cult status. Owing to Marko Brecelj, a former Buldožer member, who had approached them after a performance in Rijeka, Zoran Bulatović "Bale" (guitar), Slobodan Tišma (vocals), Ivan Fece "Firchie" (drums) and Jasmina Mitrušić "Mina" (keyboards, vocals) got the opportunity to release their debut album. However, their debut and only album "Nestvarne stvari" ("Unreal Things") was released after the band disbanded. The album was critically well acclaimed and is considered one of the finest releases of the former Yugoslav rock scene. Twenty years after the album release, in 2004, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the Novi Sad Exit festival.
History.
Formation, rise to prominence.
During the mid-1981, following a dispute between the band members of the band La Strada and the departure of the bassist Boris Oslovčan "Bora" and guitarist Predrag Ostojić, the band, at the time featuring Slobodan Tišma (guitar, vocals) and Ivan Fece "Firchie" (drums), was joined by the former Pekinška Patka member Zoran Bulatović "Bale" as the new bassist. At the time, the band was preparing for a three-date mini tour, including Novi Sad, Pančevo and Belgrade, organized by the Muzička Omladina concert agency, with the bands Lačni Franz, Čista Proza and Fotomodeli. Despite being well accepted at the performances, the band ceased to exist.
During the late 1981, Zoran Bulatović "Bale" (guitar), Slobodan Tišma (vocals) and Ivan Fece "Firchie" (drums) joined by the former Pekinška Patka member Marinko Vukmanović (bass) formed Luna, choosing the name by the Bernardo Bertolucci film "La Luna". Since the band members were already well-known, the formation of the band caused great interest in the public. The band started writing new material, with Bulatović being responsible for the music writing and arrangement, while Tišma was the band's lyricist. A few days before the band's first public appearance, Vukmanović had left the band, forming his own pop group Primavera, and was replaced by Jasmina Mitrušić "Mina" (keyboards, vocals). 
The lineup had their first live appearance in March 1982 in the Vienna club Arena at the Novosadski Novi Talas festival (Novi Sad New Wave music festival). After the festival, Luna started performing at numerous Novi Sad and Belgrade venues, establishing itself a cult status and receiving positive reactions from the critics. The journalist Petar Luković in the April 1982 edition of the "Duga" magazine stated that "Luna is today probably the most mature Novi Sad band from this generation: their music is a strange symbiosis of avant-garde influences of the alternative music scene and a luster of pop philosophy, backed with a steady rhythm and striking vocals". Yet another critic, Dragan Kremer, in the December 1982 edition of the "Omladinske novine" stated that "Luna is the best band we have. Next year either belongs to them, or to nobody else".
In the meantime, in the Radio Novi Sad studios, the band recorded their first demo, featuring the song "Ogledalo lune" ("The Mirror of Luna"), which become a local hit and was often broadcast on the Studio B radio station. The demo, along with the La Strada two track demo, a live recording of the song "Metropolis" recorded at the Ben Akiba theatre June 27, 1983, and an entire March 11 performance at the KCM Sonja Marinković surfaced during the late 1980s on the bootleg album "Hokej klub Virginitas" ("Hockey Club Virginitas") by Ding Dong records on compact cassette only. During the autumn of 1983, the band went on a tour of Croatia, performing in Zagreb and Rijeka, and Slovenia, performing in Ljubljana and Kopar. After the Rijeka performance, the band was approached by a former Buldožer member Marko Brecelj, who later took the demo recordings to his former band-mate Boris Bele, one of the head of the Helidon record label.
Debut album recording, breakup.
Having returned from the tour, the band entered the Aquarius Studio in Belgrade, where, with the help of sound engineer Đorđe Petrović and producer Saša Habić. As Bulatović later stated in an interview, the band had entered the studio well-rehearsed, with the track-sheets written out and a clearly worked out strategy of the music recording process. The album recording was finished by September 1983 and, at the time, due to a quarrel between Bulatović and Tišma, the latter was expelled from the band. Jasmina Mitrušić followed Tišma and the two went on to reforming La Strada during the following year. Bulatović went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army after which he joined Imperium of Jazz and Fece joined Katarina II. 
The debut album "Nestvarne stvari" ("Unreal Things"), was released by Helidon during the spring of 1984 and due to the band disbandment and the fact that there would be no album promotion it was released in 920 copies only. The album was marked by the poetic vignettes like "Lambo", "Okean" ("The Ocean", featuring lead vocals by Mitrušić), "Amazon" ("Amazonia"), and "Ogledalo Lune" ("The Mirror of Luna") with a consistent minimalist form. On the album Tišma signed himself as Artur, the pseudonym he started using under the influence of the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. After the album release, the "Rock" magazine voted "Nestvarne stvari" the seventh best album of the year 1984, the band also got the award Sedam Sektetara SKOJ-a in Zagreb, and the album was acclaimed by the critics as one of best debut releases in former Yugoslavia.
Post-breakup, brief reformation.
With the reformed La Strada, Tišma and Mitrušić released the album "La strada" in 1987, before disbanding in 1989. After La Strada disbanded, Tišma quit his musical career and released two poetry books, the first "Mairizmi" ("Manirisms") in 1995, and "Vrt kao to" ("Garden Like That") in 1997. A collection of his texts released in literary magazines during the late 1980s and early 1990s were published as "Blues Diary - Pitoma religiozna razmišljanja" ("Blues Diary - Cultivated Religious Meditations") in 2001 and he published an autobiographical novel "Urvidek" in 2005. He also wrote a libretto for a multimedia pseudo-opera "Kralj šume" ("King of the Forest") by Andraš Urban. Mitrušić finished the Musical Academy studies and moved to Italy. In 2001 she participated the "Pesme iznad istoka i zapada" ("Songs Above the East and the West"), featuring Serbian rock musicians performing music to the poems by Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović, with the written music and arrangement for the poem "Vladaj, Bože" ("Reign, God").
In 1992 Bulatović, accompanied by former La Strada and, at the time, Obojeni Program members Robert Radić "Robi" (drums) and Zoran Lekić "Leki" (bass guitar), shortly reformed Luna, but the band dissolved soon after due to his moving to New York City. The material recorded during the short period was released fourteen years later as Bulatović's solo album "Summer Without Syphilis" and it featured Bulatović on lead vocals and guitar. In New York, with the former Igra Staklenih Perli bassist Draško Nikodijević "Dracula", he recorded the album "...And The Gods Made Wars" as White Rabbit Cult, released in 1999, featuring sampled material related to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The following year, he remastered the album "Nestvarne stvari", featuring an alternate album cover, and released it through his own independent record label Fatamalanga Records. In 2010, Bulatović and Vukomanović reunited with their former Pekinška Patka bandmates, releasing a comeback single and announcing the release of a cover album.
Fece joined Katarina II which soon after evolved into Ekatarina Velika, with whom he recorded their eponymous debut album, after which he went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army, after which he joined Laboratorija Zvuka. In 1988 he had also promptly rejoined Ekatarina Velika on the tour promoting the album "Ljubav" ("Love"), shortly replacing Srđan Todorović before moving away to New York City in April 1988. Shortly before leaving, he had patented a drum set with an alternative way of drum tuning. In New York, Bulatović, Nikodijević and former Električni Orgazam keyboard player Ljubomir Đukić and former Bezobrazno Zeleno member Vojislav Bešić "Beške" he formed a supergroup Collateral Damage, but the band did not release any material. The funds earned on the performances, the band used to buy medications which were sent to the Novi Sad Children's Hospital. In 2007 he released the album "EKV Revisited" featuring the rerecorded material of the Ekatarina Velika songs, featuring only the original vocal tracks.
One-off reunion.
Twenty years after disbanding the default Luna lineup reunited on July 3, 2004 at the Novi Sad Exit festival main stage. The band performed the album "Nestvarne stvari" in its entirety as well three songs which did not appear on the album, "Metropolis" and "Muzika" ("Music"), demo versions of both songs being released on the semi-official compilation album "Hokej klub Virginitas" in 1988, and the unreleased song "Hulica". At the time, the band had also entered the Radio Novi Sad studio and recorded the three unreleased tracks, intending to be released with the live recording of the Exit performance, however, the recordings have remained unreleased.

Assagay

Assagay, also spelt Assegay, is a suburb of eThekwini in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and forms a part of the Upper Highway Area.
History.
Assagay was formerly a small local authority on the outskirts of Durban adjacent to its sister village of Hillcrest and has now effectively become part of that booming suburb of Durban. Assagay lost its independent Health Committee status in 1996, i.e. after the 1994 fully democratic elections, and was made subject to administration by the Outer West Local Council - a substructure council of the then Durban Unicity. Subsequently in 2000 this body, i.e. the Outer West Local Council, along with other local councils, were disestablished and replaced by the single eThekwini Municipality encompassing the entire Durban metropolitan area.
Assagay today.
Assagay has access to both the M13 and N3 freeway systems linking it directly with Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and Kassier Road links it via Old Main Road to the central commercial area of Hillcrest.
The suburb of Assagay had become known as a middle-income residential area containing a mixture of individual houses, small holdings and small town house complexes; however the considerable development in the greater Hillcrest area, over the past 10 years, has tended to change this image of the area. Large secure gated estates such as Queensbridge, Silver Oaks, Highmead and the nearby Aintree Lane residential development at Shongweni surrounding the Assagay Hotel (previously known as the Polo Pony Hotel) have seen the character change to more of a high-income area. The PheZulu Safari Park and the currently developing Stoneford Equestrian Estate is in Assagay and borders on Alverstone which is situated on the plateau of that name.
The new Hillcrest Private Hospital which is now operational and a Retirement Village which is under construction has easy access to the M13. These developments have further boosted the property values in this up-market area.
International Polo (sponsored by BMW) is played to the Shongweni Polo Ground opposite the Assagay Hotel.
Conservation and the environment.
The Assagay valley forms the original catchment area of the Umhlatuzana river which flows through the Madwala Reserves. Working for Water has made a contribution towards clearing the area of invasive plants and continues to eradicate all alien flora with the cooperation of landowners.
Origin of name.
Assagay is perhaps more commonly spelt in South Africa as Assagaai. It is the word used for a throwing spear as historically used by the amaXhosa (Xhosa) of the Transkei now part of the Eastern Cape. The name for the village of Assagay will have in turn been taken from the underlying farm named Assagay Kraal. The Voortrekkers having named the early farms in their Natalia Republic (Natal) after settling throughout the area in 1839 after defeating the amaZulu (Zulu) king Dingane. NB. The parcels of land comprising the adjacent Alverstone area are still portions of the farm Assagay Kraal No 853.

Biomass briquettes

Biomass briquettes are a biofuel substitute to coal and charcoal. They are used to heat industrial boilers in order to produce electricity from steam. The most common use of briquettes are in the developing world, where energy sources are not as widely available. There has been a move to the use of briquettes in the developed world through the use of cofiring, when the briquettes are combined with coal in order to create the heat supplied to the boiler. This reduces carbon dioxide emissions by partially replacing coal used in power plants with materials that are already contained in the carbon cycle. Manufacturers mainly use three methods to create the briquettes, each depending on the way the biomass is dried out. Although biomass briquettes are usually manufactured, biomass has been used throughout history all over the world from simply starting campfires to the mass generation of electricity.
Composition and production.
Biomass briquettes, mostly made of green waste and other organic materials, are commonly used for electricity generation, heat, and cooking fuel. These compressed compounds contain various organic materials, including rice husk, bagasse, ground nut shells, municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, or anything that contains a high nitrogen content. The composition of the briquettes varies by area due to the availability of raw materials. The raw materials are gathered and compressed into briquette in order to burn longer and make transportation of the goods easier. These briquettes are very different from charcoal because they do not have large concentrations of carbonaceous substances and added materials. Compared to fossil fuels, the briquettes produce low net total greenhouse gas emissions because the materials used are already a part of the carbon cycle.
One of the most common variables of the biomass briquette production process is the way the biomass is dried out. Manufacturers can use torrefaction, carbonization, or varying degrees of pyrolysis. Researchers concluded that torrefaction and carbonization are the most efficient forms of drying out biomass, but the use of the briquette determines which method should be used.
Compaction is another factor affecting production. Some materials burn more efficiently if compacted at low pressures, such as corn stover grind. Other materials such as wheat and barley-straw require high amounts of pressure to produce heat. There are also different press technologies that can be used. A piston press is used to create solid briquettes for a wide array of purposes. Screw extrusion is used to compact biomass into loose, homogeneous briquettes that are substituted for coal in cofiring. This technology creates a toroidal, or doughnut-like, briquette. The hole in the center of the briquette allows for a larger surface area, creating a higher combustion rate.
History.
People have been using biomass briquettes in Nepal since before recorded history. Though inefficient, the burning of loose biomass created enough heat for cooking purposes and keeping warm. The first commercial production plant was created in 1982 and produced almost 900 metric tons of biomass. In 1984, factories were constructed that incorporated vast improvements on efficiency and the quality of briquettes. They used a combination of rice husks and molasses. The King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC) along with the Institute for Himalayan Conservation (IHC) created a mixture of coal and biomass in 2000 using a unique rolling machine.
Japanese "Ogalite".
In 1925, Japan independently started developing technology to harness the energy from sawdust briquettes, known as ""Ogalite"". Between 1964 and 1969, Japan increased production fourfold by incorporating screw press and piston press technology. The member enterprise of 830 or more existed in the 1960s. The new compaction techniques incorporated in these machines made briquettes of higher quality than those in Europe. As a result, European countries bought the licensing agreements and now manufacture Japanese designed machines.
Cofiring.
Cofiring relates to the combustion of two different types of materials. The process is primarily used to decrease CO2 emissions despite the resulting lower energy efficiency and higher variable cost. The combination of materials usually contains a high carbon emitting substance such as coal and a lesser CO2 emitting material such as biomass. Even though CO2 will still be emitted through the combustion of biomass, the net carbon emitted is nearly negligible. This is due to the fact that the material gathered for the composition of the briquettes are still contained in the carbon cycle whereas fossil fuel combustion releases CO2 that has been sequestered for millennia. Boilers in power plants are traditionally heated by the combustion of coal, but if cofiring were to be implemented, then the CO2 emissions would decrease while still maintaining the heat inputted to the boiler. Implementing cofiring would require few modifications to the current characteristics to power plants, as only the fuel for the boiler would be altered. A moderate investment would be required for implementing biomass briquettes into the combustion process.
Cofiring is considered the most cost-efficient means of biomass. A higher combustion rate will occur when cofiring is implemented in a boiler when compared to burning only biomass. The compressed biomass is also much easier to transport since it is more dense, therefore allowing more biomass to be transported per shipment when compared to loose biomass. Some sources agree that a near-term solution for the greenhouse gas emission problem may lie in cofiring.
Compared to coal.
The use of biomass briquettes has been steadily increasing as industries realize the benefits of decreasing pollution through the use of biomass briquettes. Briquettes provide higher calorific value per dollar than coal when used for firing industrial boilers. Along with higher calorific value, biomass briquettes on average saved 30–40% of boiler fuel cost. But other sources suggest that cofiring is more expensive due to the widespread availability of coal and its low cost. However, in the long run, briquettes can only limit the use of coal to a small extent, but it is increasingly being pursued by industries and factories all over the world. Both raw materials can be produced or mined domestically in the United States, creating a fuel source that is free from foreign dependence and less polluting than raw fossil fuel incineration.
Environmentally, the use of biomass briquettes produces much fewer greenhouse gases, specifically, 13.8% to 41.7% and NOX. There was also a reduction from 11.1% to 38.5% in emissions when compared to coal from three different leading producers, EKCC Coal, Decanter Coal, and Alden Coal. Biomass briquettes are also fairly resistant to water degradation, an improvement over the difficulties encountered with the burning of wet coal. However, the briquettes are best used only as a supplement to coal. The use of cofiring creates an energy that is not as high as pure coal, but emits fewer pollutants and cuts down on the release of previously sequestered carbon. The continuous release of carbon and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperatures. The use of cofiring does not stop this process but decreases the relative emissions of coal power plants.
Use in developing world.
The Legacy Foundation has developed a set of techniques to produce biomass briquettes through artisanal production in rural villages that can be used for heating and cooking. These techniques were recently pioneered by Virunga National Park in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, following the massive destruction of the Mountain Gorilla habitat for charcoal.
Pangani, Tanzania, is an area covered in coconut groves. After harvesting the meat of the coconut, the indigenous people would litter the ground with the husks, believing them to be useless. The husks later became a profit center after it was discovered that coconut husks are well suited to be the main ingredient in bio briquettes. This alternative fuel mixture burns incredibly efficiently and leaves little residue, making it a reliable source for cooking in the undeveloped country. The developing world has always relied on the burning biomass due it its low cost and availability anywhere there is organic material. The briquette production only improves upon the ancient practice by increasing the efficiency of pyrolysis.
Two major components of the developing world are China and India. The economies are rapidly increasing due to cheap ways of harnessing electricity and emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide. The Kyoto Protocol attempted to regulate the emissions of the three different worlds, but there were disagreements as to which country should be penalized for emissions based on its previous and future emissions. The United States has been the largest emitter but China has recently become the largest per capita. The United States had emitted a rigorous amount of carbon dioxide during its development and the developing nations argue that they should not be forced to meet the requirements. At the lower end, the undeveloped nations believe that they have little responsibility for what has been done to the carbon dioxide levels.
The major use of biomass briquettes in India, is in industrial applications usually to produce steam. A lot of conversions of boilers from FO to biomass briquettes have happened over the past decade. A vast majority of those projects are registered under CDM (Kyoto Protocol), which allows for users to get carbon credits.
The use of biomass briquettes is strongly encouraged by issuing carbon credits. One carbon credit is equal to one free ton of carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere. India has started to replace charcoal with biomass briquettes in regards to boiler fuel, especially in the southern parts of the country because the biomass briquettes can be created domestically, depending on the availability of land. Therefore, constantly rising fuel prices will be less influential in an economy if sources of fuel can be easily produced domestically. Lehra Fuel Tech Pvt Ltd is approved by Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), is one of the largest briquetting machine manufacturers from Ludhiana, India.
In the African Great Lakes region, work on biomass briquette production has been spearheaded by a number of NGOs with GVEP (Global Village Energy Partnership Citizens are also starting to manufacture briquettes at home. The first machines would create briquettes for homeowners out of compressed sawdust, however, current machines allow for briquette production out of any sort of dried biomass.
Arizona has also taken initiative to turn waste biomass into a source of energy. Waste cotton and pecan material used to provide a nesting ground for bugs that would destroy the new crops in the spring. To stop this problem farmers buried the biomass, which quickly led to soil degradation. These materials were discovered to be a very efficient source of energy and took care of issues that had plagued farms.
The United States Department of Energy has financed several projects to test the viability of biomass briquettes on a national scale. The scope of the projects is to increase the efficiency of gasifiers as well as produce plans for production facilities.
Criticism.
Biomass is composed of organic materials, therefore, large amounts of land are required to produce the fuel. Critics argue that the use of this land should be utilized for food distribution rather than crop degradation. Also, climate changes may cause a harsh season, where the material extracted will need to be swapped for food rather than energy. The assumption is that the production of biomass decreases the food supply, causing an increase in world hunger by extracting the organic materials such as corn and soybeans for fuel rather than food.
The cost of implementing a new technology such as biomass into the current infrastructure is also high. The fixed costs with the production of biomass briquettes are high due to the new undeveloped technologies that revolve around the extraction, production and storage of the biomass. Technologies regarding extraction of oil and coal have been developing for decades, becoming more efficient with each year. A new undeveloped technology regarding fuel utilization that has no infrastructure built around makes it nearly impossible to compete in the current market.

SCP 06F6

SCP 06F6 is (or was) an astronomical object of unknown type, discovered on 21 February 2006 in the constellation Boötes
during a survey of galaxy cluster CL 1432.5+3332.8 with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel.
According to research authored by Kyle Barbary of the Supernova Cosmology Project, the object brightened over a period of roughly 100 days, reaching a peak intensity of magnitude 21; it then faded over a similar period.
Barbary "et al." report that the spectrum of light emitted from the object does not match known supernova types, and is dissimilar to any known phenomena in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. The light in the blue region shows broad line features, while the red region shows continuous emission. The spectrum shows a handful of spectral lines, but when astronomers try to trace any one of them to an element the other lines fail to match up with any other known elements.
Because of its uncommon spectrum, the team was not able to determine the distance to the object using standard redshift techniques; it is not even known whether the object is within or outside the Milky Way. Furthermore, no Milky Way star or external galaxy has been detected at this location, meaning any source is very faint.
The European X-ray satellite XMM Newton made an observation in early August 2006 which appears to show an X-ray glow around SCP 06F6, two orders of magnitude more luminous than that of supernovae.
Observations from the Palomar Transient Factory reported in 2009, indicate a redshift "z" = 1.189 and a peak magnitude of −23.5 absolute (comparable to SN2005ap) making SCP 06F6 one of the most luminous transient phenomenon known as of that date.
Possible causes.
Supernovae reach their maximum brightness in only 20 days, and then take much longer to fade away. Researchers had initially conjectured that SCP 06F6 might be an extremely remote supernova; relativistic time dilation might have caused a 20-day event to stretch out over a period of 100 days. But this explanation now seems unlikely. Other conjectures that have been advanced involve a collision between a white dwarf and an asteroid, or the collision of a white dwarf with a black hole.
An analysis by a team from the University of Warwick (Boris Gänsicke "et al.") suggests that the light spectrum is "consistent with emission from a cool, carbon-rich atmosphere at a redshift of z~0.14", possibly representing the core collapse and explosion of a carbon star. Gänsicke's group concurs with Barbary "et al." that SCP 06F6 may represent "a new class" of celestial object.
The analysis of Israeli astronomers of Technion, suggest four alternative explanations for SCP 06F6, in plausibility order: the tidal destruction of a CO white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole, a type Ia supernova exploding inside the dense stellar wind of a carbon star, an asteroid that was swallowed up by a white dwarf or, least likely, a core-collapse supernova.
Observations in 2009 indicate that it may be a pair-instability supernova. 
The event was similar to SN 2005ap, and other unusually bright supernova suggesting that it was a new type of supernova.

Muslim Bagh

Muslim Bagh () is a town of Qilla Saifullah District in the Balochistan province of Pakistan. According to Census of 1998, the population of Muslim Bagh is 70,361 (Male 37,303 and Female 33,058) and 10,188 households.
Muslim Bagh is believed to be named after a garden planted by aSufi saint. In some winters, Kan Mehtarzai and Muslim Bagh experience several feet of snow, though normal temperature is about -7°C to 10°C (19°F to 50°F).
Various tribes of Kakar Pashtun inhabit the valley. In Kakar tribes the most famous tribes are, Sargarh,Khuidadzai, Samkhail, Sultan Zai, Bazai and Rahatzai. Though in touch with the outside world for a long time they have retained their age-old traditions and are proud of them. Their hospitality is well known and the coming of a guest is always considered a blessing,and the famous personalities of muslim bagh are, Haji Abdul Kareem Khuidadzai, Sardar Abdul Rasheed Khan Sargarah, Sardar Hayatullah Khan Mehterzai, Haji Mustafa Rahatzai,Malak Jan Muhammad Bazai and Haji Muhammad Azam Khuidadzai.
Railways.
This section of railways, when laid during the British Raj, was called the Zhob Valley Railway (ZVR). It has been out of service since 1986 but these days all the left over track is being uprooted and sold as scrap. This was once longest Narrow-Gauge Railways of the British Raj. 
During First World War, a Railway line was laid from a place called Khanai (30 km north of Quetta) to a place called Muslim Bagh. Muslim Bagh had Chrome mines, which was used in munitions of First World War. The railway line at that time was a private siding for the Balochistan Chrome Ore Company. The work started on Khanai-Muslim Bagh line in 1916 and was opened for rail traffic in 1921. In 1927, the Muslim Bagh to Qila Saifullah section was opened and finally the section up to Zhob was opened in 1929. The total length of this railway from Bostan to Zhob was 294 km, which made it the longest narrow gauge railway of the British Raj in the 1920s. It had 11 stations in between including the famous Kan Mehtarzai station which was the highest station in Pakistan at an altitude of 2224 metres (7295 feet).
For a long part of its journey, the railway followed the Zhob River and thus it was called the Zhob Valley Railway (ZVR).
Chromite.
Chromite is the source of chromium used commercially and as an alloying element plays an important role in metallurgy. Balochistan is endowed with huge reserves of chromite. The first discovery was made at Muslim Bagh and Khanozai in district Kila Saifullah in 1901. Muslim Bagh deposits were first discovered by Vredenburg during the same period in the course of regional reconnaissance mapping of the province. Chromite mining has not been systematic but random and totally disorganised. It is mined by both open pit and underground methods. In Muslimbagh, Ras Koh Range and Wad areas, chromite is mostly mined by open pit method. However, due to podiform nature of the chromite, underground mining is also done. Use of donkeys for hauling the ore from underground is still in practice. The haulage machinery is also used. Presently, 300 to 500 tons of chromite are being produced at Muslim Bagh and Khanozai daily. It is taken in trucks to Karachi where it is crushed and packed in bags for export to foreign countries. Price depends on chrome content. China is a big market for the Balochistan chromite. Production activity in the sector directly depends upon the export market. The Provincial Inspectorate of Mines is responsible for regulating the mining operations. Presently, a few local companies are engaged at Muslim Bagh. The sources added that during the 1970s, Pakistan Chrom Mines (PCM) project was launched in Muslim Bagh area which was closed in 1989 due to financial constraints and lack of locally available technical staff. The land for mining is allotted under the Mines Act 1923 by the Directorate of Minerals, Balochistan.
Archeology.
The district has some archaeological sites mainly attributed to the Mughals. The ruins of an old fort called Mughalo Killa or "the fort of the Mughals" were found to the west of the Karezgai village, about 3¼ kilometres from Muslim Bagh, below which there is a spring of water which was reopened about 125 years ago. Fragments of ancient pottery were found in these ruins and it is said that old silver and copper coins were also found. The ruins of a fort called Khanki lie near Shina Khura about 25 kilometres east of Muslim Bagh. Local tradition asserts that the fort was held by Miro, a Mughal governor, who was miraculously overthrown by Sanzar Nika, the progenitor of the Sanzarkhel Kakars. There are also ruins of an old fort called the Mughalo Brunj in Murgha Faqirzai. Similar ruins occur near Toiwar, Sharan, Ismailzai and on the Zhar hill near Akhtarzai. There also exist ancient karezes, said to have been made in Mughal times, which may be considered as relics of archaeological interest. These include Karez Akhtarzai, Karez Soghai and Mustafa Karez in Killa Saifullah sub-division and 2 karezes in Sra Khulla, about 6½ kilometres from Muslim Bagh.

Stanisław Karolkiewicz

Stanisław Karolkiewicz (nom de guerre "Szczęsny") (1918–2009) was born in 1918 in the Polish historical region of Podlasie. Raised in a patriotic family, he joined the Polish Army in the 1930s, and then fought in the Polish September Campaign, in the area of Upper Silesia. On September 17, 1939, when the Red Army, allied with the Wehrmacht, attacked eastern Poland, Karolkiewicz was around Nisko.
Caught by the Germans, he escaped and returned to his homeland in the Białystok countryside, which had been incorporated to the Soviet Union. He immediately began organizing anti-Soviet resistance movement, taking advantage of the landscape of the province, full of forests and swamps. His unit stayed around Augustów, between the Biebrza river and the Augustów Canal.
In February 1940, the NKVD launched an offensive against anti-Soviet Polish guerillas, and Karolkiewicz was caught. The Soviets put him in prisons in Białystok and later in Brześć nad Bugiem. He was charged of counterrevolutionary activities, but, unlike other prisoners (see: Katyń massacre), he was not shot. Kept in the prison in Brzesc, he was released in June 1941, when the Wehrmacht seized the city (see: Operation Barbarossa).
Under German occupation, Karolkiewicz did not change his stance and became commandant of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion of the Białystok area. Then, he joined underground forces in Szczuczyn and was the commandant of the 1943 Polish underground raid on East Prussia, which took place on August 15, 1943. After the raid, Karolkiewicz and his men got to the Naliboki Forest, to join units of Wilno’s Home Army district and to take part in the Operation Tempest (summer 1944).
Karolkiewicz, who was a commandant of a Home Army company, participated in street fighting in the suburbs of Wilno. Shelled by the German artillery and attacked by the Luftwaffe aircraft, the company had to withdraw to a nearby forest. Soon afterwards, the NKVD units appeared and began to disarm the Poles. Karolkiewicz managed to escape the Soviets and headed towards Warsaw. He was caught by the NKVD in Warsaw’s eastern quarter of Praga, and incarcerated in the infamous Lublin Castle prison, in which mortality among the political prisoners reached 20 persons per week.
The interrogation was at first carried out by the NKVD officers, then it was handed over to the Służba Bezpieczeństwa. Karolkiewicz, who was not considered a major threat to the Communist authorities, was released in mid-1945 and immediately became a member of anticommunist resistance organization Armed Forces Delegation for Poland. Arrested in February 1946, he was sentenced to 13 years and incarcerated in the Wronki prison. Together with him, the Communists arrested his wife, who gave birth to a daughter in a call at Mokotów Prison. Karolkiewicz stayed in prison until October 1955.
In 1947 and 1948, Karolkiewicz was in the same cell with Władysław Bartoszewski. Bartoszewski later said in an interview: “I heard that he had had a very rough investigation, even for Communist reality. He was a legendary person, I heard opinions of him as a skillful commandant, about his legendary exploits during the war”.
In the 1990s, Karolkiewicz was elected President of World Society of Home Army Soldiers. On May 3, 2006, he was promoted to Brigade General, by President Lech Kaczyński. Stanislaw Karolkiewicz died 22.01.2009.

Augustine Skinner

Augustine Skinner (c. 1594 – 11 June 1672) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1642 and 1659. He took the Parliamentary side during the English Civil War.
Skinner was of Tutsham Hall at West Farleigh in Kent and belonged to a newly arrived rather than established Kent family (his ancestors being from Devon. In 1642, he was elected Member of Parliament member for Kent the Long Parliament. He supported parliament in the Civil War and was sufficiently orthodox in his support to survive Pride's Purge. He refused to accept appointment as a Commissioner in the trial of the King. After the expulsion of the Rump Parliament he represented Kent again in the Parliament of 1654, and in the restored Rump in 1659. He was an active Justice of the Peace throughout the Commonwealth period, and it was said that Cromwell had great confidence in him as a magistrate.
Skinner borrowed money to buy two manors which had been confiscated from the Bishop of Rochester; when these were restored to their original ownership at the Restoration, he found himself heavily in debt. His brother William was in similar difficulties, and together they procured a private Act of Parliament in 1660 to allow them to sell other lands to raise funds, Skinner's seat at Tutsham Hall being sold to one Edward Goulston. Skinner was still unable to meet his obligations and, being arrested for debt, he eventually died in the Fleet Prison in 1672, aged 78. He was buried at West Farleigh.
Skinner made two good marriages, to Elizabeth Twisden, daughter of Serjeant-at-Law Richard Braithwaite, and to Ann Franklin, daughter of Thomas Franklin, an Alderman of the City of London; but his only son, also called Augustine (born 1618), lived less than a year, so that his heir was his brother, William.

Kali

' (, ), also known as ' (), is the Hindu goddess associated with empowerment, shakti. The name Kali comes from "kāla", which means black, time, death, lord of death, Shiva. Since Shiva is called Kāla—the eternal time—Kālī, his consort, also means "Time" or "Death" (as in time has come). Hence, Kāli is the Goddess of Time and Change. Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation of evil forces still has some influence. Various Shakta Hindu cosmologies, as well as Shākta Tantric beliefs, worship her as the ultimate reality or "Brahman". She is also revered as Bhavatārini (literally "redeemer of the universe"). Comparatively recent devotional movements largely conceive Kāli as a benevolent mother goddess.
Kālī is represented as the consort of Lord Shiva, on whose body she is often seen standing. Shiva lies in the path of Kali, whose foot on Shiva subdues her anger. She is the fierce aspect of the goddess Durga (Parvati).
Etymology.
' is the feminine form of ' ("black, dark coloured"). Kāla primarily means "time" but also means "black" in honor of being the first creation before light itself. Kālī means "the black one" and refers to her being the entity of "time" or "beyond time." Kāli is strongly associated with Shiva, and Shaivas derive the masculine Kāla (an epithet of Shiva) to come from her feminine name. A nineteenth-century Sanskrit dictionary, the Shabdakalpadrum, states: कालः शिवः । तस्य पत्नीति - काली । kālaḥ śivaḥ । tasya patnīti kālī - "Shiva is Kāla, thus, his consort is Kāli" referring to Devi Parvathi being a manifestation of Devi MahaKali.
Other names include ' ("black night"), as described above, and ' ("relating to time"). Coburn notes that the name Kālī can be used as a proper name, or as a description of color.
Kāli's association with darkness stands in contrast to her consort, Shiva, who manifested after her in creation, and who symbolises the rest of creation after Time is created. In his supreme awareness of Maya, his body is covered by the white ashes of the cremation ground (Sanskrit: ') where he meditates, and with which Kāli is also associated, as '. It is said that aspirants who wish to offer Bhakthi should approach under the proper guidance of a Siddha or equivalent. Chanting her mantras from anywhere would cause unknown effects.
Origins.
Hugh Urban notes that although the word ' appears as early as the Atharva Veda written 1000 BCE or older, the first use of it as a proper name is in the "Kathaka Grhya Sutra" (19.7). Kali is the name of one of the seven tongues of Agni, the God of Fire, in the "Mundaka Upanishad" (2:4), but it is unlikely that this refers to the goddess. The first appearance of Kāli in her present form is in the Sauptika Parvan of the "Mahabharata" (10.8.64). She is called ' (literally, "black night") and appears to the Pandava soldiers in dreams, until finally she appears amidst the fighting during an attack by Drona's son Ashwatthama. She most famously appears in the sixth century "Devi Mahatmyam" as one of the shaktis of Mahadevi, and defeats the demon Raktabija ("Bloodseed"). The tenth-century Kalika Purana venerates Kāli as the ultimate reality.
According to David Kinsley, Kāli is first mentioned in Hinduism as a distinct goddess around 600 CE, and these texts "usually place her on the periphery of Hindu society or on the battlefield." She is often regarded as the Shakti of Shiva, and is closely associated with him in various Puranas. The Kalika Purana depicts her as the "Adi Shakti" (Fundamental Power) and "Para Prakriti" or beyond nature.
Worship and mantra.
Kali could be considered a general concept, like Durga, and is mostly worshiped in the Kali Kula sect of worship. The closest way of direct worship is Maha Kali or Bhadra Kali (Bhadra in Sanskrit means 'gentle'). Kali is worshiped as one of the 10 Mahavidya forms of Adi Parashakti (Goddess Durga) or Bhagavathy according to the region. The mantra for worship is called Devi Argala Stotram. 
Tantra.
Goddesses play an important role in the study and practice of Tantra Yoga, and are affirmed to be as central to discerning the nature of reality as are the male deities. Although Parvati is often said to be the recipient and student of Shiva's wisdom in the form of "Tantras", it is Kāli who seems to dominate much of the Tantric iconography, texts, and rituals. In many sources Kāli is praised as the highest reality or greatest of all deities. The "Nirvana-tantra" says the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva all arise from her like bubbles in the sea, ceaselessly arising and passing away, leaving their original source unchanged. The "Niruttara-tantra" and the "Picchila-tantra" declare all of Kāli's mantras to be the greatest and the "Yogini-tantra", "Kamakhya-tantra" and the "Niruttara-tantra" all proclaim Kāli "vidyas" (manifestations of "Mahadevi", or "divinity itself"). They declare her to be an essence of her own form ("svarupa") of the "Mahadevi".
In the "Mahanirvana-tantra", Kāli is one of the epithets for the primordial "sakti", and in one passage Shiva praises her:
The figure of Kāli conveys death, destruction, and the consuming aspects of reality. As such, she is also a "forbidden thing", or even death itself. In the "Pancatattva" ritual, the "sadhaka" boldly seeks to confront Kali, and thereby assimilates and transforms her into a vehicle of salvation. This is clear in the work of the "Karpuradi-stotra", a short praise of Kāli describing the "Pancatattva" ritual unto her, performed on cremation grounds. ("Samahana-sadhana")
The "Karpuradi-stotra" clearly indicates that Kāli is more than a terrible, vicious, slayer of demons who serves Durga or Shiva. Here, she is identified as the supreme mistress of the universe, associated with the five elements. In union with Lord Shiva, she creates and destroys worlds. Her appearance also takes a different turn, befitting her role as ruler of the world and object of meditation. In contrast to her terrible aspects, she takes on hints of a more benign dimension. She is described as young and beautiful, has a gentle smile, and makes gestures with her two right hands to dispel any fear and offer boons. The more positive features exposed offer the distillation of divine wrath into a goddess of salvation, who rids the "sadhaka" of fear. Here, Kali appears as a symbol of triumph over death.
Bengali tradition.
Kali is also a central figure in late medieval Bengali devotional literature, with such devotees as Ramprasad Sen (1718–75). With the exception of being associated with Parvati as Shiva's consort, Kāli is rarely pictured in Hindu legends and iconography as a motherly figure until Bengali devotions beginning in the early eighteenth century. Even in Bengāli tradition her appearance and habits change little, if at all.
The Tantric approach to Kāli is to display courage by confronting her on cremation grounds in the dead of night, despite her terrible appearance. In contrast, the Bengali devotee appropriates Kāli's teachings adopting the attitude of a child, coming to love her unreservedly. In both cases, the goal of the devotee is to become reconciled with death and to learn acceptance of the way that things are. These themes are well addressed in Rāmprasād's work.
Rāmprasād comments in many of his other songs that Kāli is indifferent to his wellbeing, causes him to suffer, brings his worldly desires to nothing and his worldly goods to ruin. He also states that she does not behave like a mother should and that she ignores his pleas:
To be a child of Kāli, Rāmprasād asserts, is to be denied of earthly delights and pleasures. Kāli is said to refrain from giving that which is expected. To the devotee, it is perhaps her very refusal to do so that enables her devotees to reflect on dimensions of themselves and of reality that go beyond the material world.
A significant portion of Bengali devotional music features Kāli as its central theme and is known as Shyama Sangeet ("Music of the Night"). Mostly sung by male vocalists, today even women have taken to this form of music. One of the finest singers of Shyāma Sāngeet is Pannalal Bhattacharya.
In Bengal, Kāli is venerated in the festival Kali Puja - the new moon day of Ashwin month which coincides with Diwali festival.
In a unique form of Kāli worship, Shantipur worships Kāli in the form of a hand painted image of the deity known as Poteshwari (meaning the deity drawn on a piece of cloth).
Legends.
Slayer of Raktabija.
In Kāli's most famous legend, Devi Durga (Adi Parashakti) and her assistants, the Matrikas, wound the demon Raktabija, in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him. They soon find that they have worsened the situation for with every drop of blood that is dripped from Raktabija he reproduces a clone of himself. The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates. Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons. It is said, in some versions, that Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. The "Devi Mahatmyam" describes:
"Out of the surface of her (Durga's) forehead, fierce with frown, issued suddenly Kali of terrible countenance, armed with a sword and noose. Bearing the strange khatvanga (skull-topped staff ), decorated with a garland of skulls, clad in a tiger's skin, very appalling owing to her emaciated flesh, with gaping mouth, fearful with her tongue lolling out, having deep reddish eyes, filling the regions of the sky with her roars, falling upon impetuously and slaughtering the great asuras in that army, she devoured those hordes of the foes of the devas."
Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. In the "Devi Mahatmya" version of this story, Kali is also described as a "Matrika" and as a "Shakti" or power of Devi. She is given the epithet "" ("Chamunda"), i.e. the slayer of the demons Chanda and Munda. "Chamunda" is very often identified with Kali and is very much like her in appearance and habit.
Dakshina Kali.
In her most famous pose as "Daksinakali", popular legends say that Kali, becoming drunk on the blood of her victims on the battlefield, dances with destructive frenzy. She is about to destroy whole universe when urged by all Gods Shiva lies on her way to stop her. In her fury she fails to see the body of Shiva, who lies among the corpses on the battlefield and steps on his chest. Realizing Shiva lies beneath her feet, her anger is pacified and she calms her fury. Though not added in any of the puranas, the popular legends tell that Kali was ashamed at the prospect of keeping her husband beneath her feet and thus stuck her tongue out in shame. The 'Devi-purana", which goes into great depths about Goddess Kali, reveals the true reason for the symbolism of the tongue. The characteristic icons that depict Kali are the following; unbridled matted hair, open blood shot eyes, open mouth and a drooping tongue; in her hands, she holds a Khadga (bent sword or scimitar) and a human head; she has a girdle of human hands across her waist and an enchanted Shiva lies beneath her feet. Each of these icons represent a deep philosophical epithet. The drooping out-stuck tongue represents her blood-thirst. Lord Shiva beneath her feet represents matter, as Kali is undoubtedly the primeval energy. The depiction of Kali on Shiva shows that without energy, matter lies "dead". This concept has been simplified to a folk-tale depicting a wife placing her foot on her husband and sticking her tongue out in shame. In tantric contexts, the tongue is seen to denote the element ("guna") of "rajas" (energy and action) controlled by "sattva".
If Kali steps on Shiva with her right foot and holds the sword in her left hand, she is considered to be "Dakshina Kali". The Dakshina Kali Temple has important religious associations with the Jagannath Temple and it is believed that Daksinakali is the guardian of the kitchen of the Lord Jagannath Temple. Puranic tradition says that in Puri, Lord Jagannath is regarded as Daksinakalika. Goddess Dakshinakali plays an important role in the 'Niti' of Saptapuri Amavasya.
One South Indian tradition tells of a dance contest between Shiva and Kali. After defeating the two demons Sumbha and Nisumbha, Kali takes up residence in the forest of Thiruvalankadu or Thiruvalangadu. She terrorizes the surrounding area with her fierce, disruptive nature. One of Shiva's devotees becomes distracted while performing austerities, and asks Shiva to rid the forest of the destructive goddess. When Shiva arrives, Kali threatens him, claiming the territory as her own. Shiva challenges Kali to a dance contest; both of them dance and Kali matches Shiva in every step that he takes until Shiva takes the "Urdhvatandava" step, by vertically raising his right leg. Kali refuses to perform this step, which would not befit her as a woman, and became pacified.
Smashan Kali.
If the Kali steps out with the left foot and holds the sword in her right hand, she is the terrible form of Mother, the Smashan Kali of the cremation ground. She is worshiped by tantrics, the followers of Tantra, who believe that one's spiritual discipline practiced in a smashan (cremation ground) brings success quickly. Sarda Devi, the consort of Ramakrishna Paramhansa, worshipped Smashan Kali at Dakshineshwar.
Maternal Kali.
Another legend depicts the infant Shiva calming Kali. In this similar story, Kali has defeated her enemies on the battlefield and begun to dance out of control, drunk on the blood of the slain. To calm her down and to protect the stability of the world, Shiva is sent to the battlefield, as an infant, crying aloud. Seeing the child's distress, Kali ceases dancing to care for the helpless infant. She picks him up, kisses his head, and proceeds to breast feed the infant Shiva. This legend is notable because it shows Kali in her benevolent, maternal aspect, with which she is not usually identified.
Mahakali.
"Mahakali" (Sanskrit: Mahākālī, Devanagari: महाकाली), literally translated as "Great Kali", is sometimes considered as a greater form of Kali, identified with the Ultimate reality of Brahman. It can also be used as an honorific of the Goddess Kali, signifying her greatness by the prefix "Mahā-". Mahakali, in Sanskrit, is etymologically the feminized variant of Mahakala or "Great Time" (which is interpreted also as "Death"), an epithet of the God Shiva in Hinduism. Mahakali is the presiding Goddess of the first episode of the "Devi Mahatmya". Here she is depicted as Devi in her universal form as Shakti. Here Devi serves as the agent who allows the cosmic order to be restored.
Kali is depicted in the Mahakali form as having ten heads, ten arms, and ten legs. Each of her ten hands is carrying a various implement which vary in different accounts, but each of these represent the power of one of the Devas or Hindu Gods and are often the identifying weapon or ritual item of a given Deva. The implication is that Mahakali subsumes and is responsible for the powers that these deities possess and this is in line with the interpretation that Mahakali is identical with Brahman. While not displaying ten heads, an "ekamukhi" or one headed image may be displayed with ten arms, signifying the same concept: the powers of the various Gods come only through Her grace.
Iconography.
Kali is portrayed mostly in two forms: the popular four-armed form and the ten-armed Mahakali form. In both of her forms, she is described as being black in color but is most often depicted as blue in popular Indian art. Her eyes are described as red with intoxication, and in absolute rage, her hair is shown disheveled, small fangs sometimes protrude out of her mouth, and her tongue is lolling. She is often shown naked or just wearing a skirt made of human arms and a garland of human heads. She is also accompanied by serpents and a jackal while standing on a seemingly dead Shiva, usually right foot forward to symbolize the more popular Dakshinamarga or right-handed path, as opposed to the more infamous and transgressive Vamamarga or left-handed path.
In the ten-armed form of Mahakali she is depicted as shining like a blue stone. She has ten faces and ten feet and three eyes. She has ornaments decked on all her limbs. There is no association with Shiva.
The "Kalika Purana" describes Kali as possessing a soothing dark complexion, as perfectly beautiful, riding a lion, four-armed, holding a sword and blue lotuses, her hair unrestrained, body firm and youthful.
In spite of her seemingly terrible form, Kali Ma is often considered the kindest and most loving of all the Hindu goddesses, as she is regarded by her devotees as the Mother of the whole Universe. And because of her terrible form, she is also often seen as a great protector.
When the Bengali saint Ramakrishna once asked a devotee why one would prefer to worship Mother over him, this devotee rhetorically replied, "Maharaj, when they are in trouble your devotees come running to you. But, where do you run when you are in trouble?"
According to Ramakrishna, darkness is the Ultimate Mother, or Kali:
"My Mother is the principle of consciousness. She is Akhanda Satchidananda;
"indivisible Reality, Awareness, and Bliss. The night sky between the stars is perfectly black.
"The waters of the ocean depths are the same; The infinite is always mysteriously dark.
"This inebriating darkness is my beloved Kali.
"-Sri Ramakrishna
This is clear in the works of such contemporary artists as Charles Wish, and Tyeb Mehta, who sometimes take great liberties with the traditional, accepted symbolism, but still demonstrate a true reverence for the Shakta sect.
Popular form.
Classic depictions of Kali share several features, as follows:
Kali's most common four armed iconographic image shows each hand carrying variously a sword, a trishul (trident), a severed head and a bowl or skull-cup (kapala) catching the blood of the severed head.
Two of these hands (usually the left) are holding a sword and a severed head. The Sword signifies Divine Knowledge and the Human Head signifies human Ego which must be slain by Divine Knowledge in order to attain Moksha. The other two hands (usually the right) are in the abhaya (fearlessness) and varada (blessing) mudras, which means her initiated devotees (or anyone worshipping her with a true heart) will be saved as she will guide them here and in the hereafter.
She has a garland consisting of human heads, variously enumerated at 108 (an auspicious number in Hinduism and the number of countable beads on a Japa Mala or rosary for repetition of Mantras) or 51, which represents Varnamala or the Garland of letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, Devanagari. Hindus believe Sanskrit is a language of dynamism, and each of these letters represents a form of energy, or a form of Kali. Therefore she is generally seen as the mother of language, and all mantras.
She is often depicted naked which symbolizes her being beyond the covering of Maya since she is pure (nirguna) being-consciousness-bliss and far above prakriti. She is shown as very dark as she is brahman in its supreme unmanifest state. She has no permanent qualities—she will continue to exist even when the universe ends. It is therefore believed that the concepts of color, light, good, bad do not apply to her—she is the pure, un-manifested energy, the Adi-shakti.
Shiva in Kali iconography.
In both these images she is shown standing on the prone, inert or dead body of Shiva. There is a legend for the reason behind her standing on what appears to be Shiva's corpse, which translates as follows:
Once Kali had destroyed all the demons in battle, she began a terrific dance out of the sheer joy of victory. All the worlds or lokas began to tremble and sway under the impact of her dance. So, at the request of all the Gods, Shiva himself asked her to desist from this behavior. However, she was too intoxicated to listen. Hence, Shiva lay like a corpse among the slain demons in order to absorb the shock of the dance into himself. When Kali eventually stepped upon Shiva, she realized she was trampling and hurting her husband and bit her tongue in shame.
The story described here is a popular folk tale and not described or hinted in any of the puranas. The puranic interpretation is as follows:
Once, Parvati asks Shiva to chose the one form among her 10 forms which he likes most. To her surprise, Shiva reveals that he is most comfortable with her Kali form, in which she is bereft of her jewellery, her human-form, her clothes, her emotions and where she is only raw, chaotic energy, where she is as terrible as time itself and even greater than time. As Parvati takes the form of Kali, Shiva lies at her feet and requests her to place her foot on his chest, upon his heart. Once in this form, Shiva requests her to have this place, below her feet in her iconic image which would be worshiped throughout.
This idea has been explored in the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and is most popular in the Shyama Sangeet, devotional songs to Kali from the 12th to 15th centuries.
The Tantric interpretation of Kali standing on top of her husband is as follows:
The Shiv tattava (Divine Consciousness as Shiva) is inactive, while the Shakti tattava (Divine Energy as Kali) is active. Shiva and Kali represent Brahman, the Absolute pure consciousness which is beyond all names, forms and activities. Kali, on the other hand, represents the potential (and manifested) energy responsible for all names, forms and activities. She is his Shakti, or creative power, and is seen as the substance behind the entire content of all consciousness. She can never exist apart from Shiva or act independently of him, just as Shiva remains a mere corpse without Kali i.e., Shakti, all the matter/energy of the universe, is not distinct from Shiva, or Brahman, but is rather the dynamic power of Brahman. Hence, Kali is Para Brahman in the feminine and dynamic aspect while Shiva is the male aspect and static. She stands as the absolute basis for all life, energy and beneath her feet lies, Shiva, a metaphor for mass, which cannot retain its form without energy.
While this is an advanced concept in monistic Shaktism, it also agrees with the Nondual Trika philosophy of Kashmir, popularly known as Kashmir Shaivism and associated most famously with Abhinavagupta. There is a colloquial saying that "Shiva without Shakti is Shava" which means that without the power of action (Shakti) that is Mahakali (represented as the short "i" in Devanagari) Shiva (or consciousness itself) is inactive; Shava means corpse in Sanskrit and the play on words is that all Sanskrit consonants are assumed to be followed by a short letter "a" unless otherwise noted. The short letter "i" represents the female power or Shakti that activates Creation. This is often the explanation for why She is standing on Shiva, who is either Her husband and complement in Shaktism or the Supreme Godhead in Shaivism.
To properly understand this complex Tantric symbolism it is important to remember that the meaning behind Shiva and Kali does not stray from the non-dualistic parlance of Shankara or the Upanisads. According to both the Mahanirvana and Kularnava Tantras, there are two distinct ways of perceiving the same absolute reality. The first is a transcendental plane which is often described as static, yet infinite. It is here that there is no matter, there is no universe and only consciousness exists. This form of reality is known as Shiva, the absolute Sat-Chit-Ananda—existence, knowledge and bliss. The second is an active plane, an immanent plane, the plane of matter, of Maya, i.e., where the illusion of space-time and the appearance of an actual universe does exist. This form of reality is known as Kali or Shakti, and (in its entirety) is still specified as the same Absolute Sat-Chit-Ananda. It is here in this second plane that the universe (as we commonly know it) is experienced and is described by the Tantric seer as the play of Shakti, or God as Mother Kali.
From a Tantric perspective, when one meditates on reality at rest, as absolute pure consciousness (without the activities of creation, preservation or dissolution) one refers to this as Shiva or Brahman. When one meditates on reality as dynamic and creative, as the Absolute content of pure consciousness (with all the activities of creation, preservation or dissolution) one refers to it as Kali or Shakti. However, in either case the yogini or yogi is interested in one and the same reality—the only difference being in name and fluctuating aspects of appearance. It is this which is generally accepted as the meaning of Kali standing on the chest of Shiva.
Although there is often controversy surrounding the images of divine copulation, the general consensus is benign and free from any carnal impurities in its substance. In Tantra the human body is a symbol for the microcosm of the universe; therefore sexual process is responsible for the creation of the world. Although theoretically Shiva and Kali (or Shakti) are inseparable, like fire and its power to burn, in the case of creation they are often seen as having separate roles. With Shiva as male and Kali as female it is only by their union that creation may transpire. This reminds us of the prakrti and purusa doctrine of Samkhya wherein prakāśa- vimarśa has no practical value, just as without prakrti, purusa is quite inactive. This (once again) stresses the interdependencies of Shiva and Shakti and the vitality of their union.
Gopi Krishna proposed that Kali standing on the dead Shiva or Shava (Sanskrit for dead body) symbolised the helplessness of a person undergoing the changing process (psychologically and physiologically) in the body conducted by the Kundalini Shakti.
Development.
In the later traditions, Kali has become inextricably linked with Shiva. The unleashed form of Kali often becomes wild and uncontrollable, and only Shiva is able to tame her just as only Kali can tame Shiva. This is both because she is often a transformed version of one of his consorts and because he is able to match her wildness.
The ancient text of Kali Kautuvam describes her competition with Shiva in dance, from which the sacred 108 Karanas appeared. Shiva won the competition by acting the urdva tandava, one of the Karanas, by raising his feet to his head. Other texts describe Shiva appearing as a crying infant and appealing to her maternal instincts. While Shiva is said to be able to tame her, the iconography often presents her dancing on his fallen body, and there are accounts of the two of them dancing together, and driving each other to such wildness that the world comes close to unravelling.
Shiva's involvement with Tantra and Kali's dark nature have led to her becoming an important Tantric figure. To the Tantric worshippers, it was essential to face her Curse, the terror of death, as willingly as they accepted Blessings from her beautiful, nurturing, maternal aspect. For them, wisdom meant learning that no coin has only one side: as death cannot exist without life, so life cannot exist without death. Kali's role sometimes grew beyond that of a chaos—which could be confronted—to that of one who could bring wisdom, and she is given great metaphysical significance by some Tantric texts. The Nirvāna-tantra clearly presents her uncontrolled nature as the Ultimate Reality, claiming that the trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra arise and disappear from her like bubbles from the sea. Although this is an extreme case, the Yogini-tantra, Kamakhya-tantra and the Niruttara-tantra declare her the svarupa (own-being) of the Mahadevi (the great Goddess, who is in this case seen as the combination of all devis).
The final stage of development is the worshipping of Kali as the Great Mother, devoid of her usual violence. This practice is a break from the more traditional depictions. The pioneers of this tradition are the 18th century Shakta poets such as Ramprasad Sen, who show an awareness of Kali's ambivalent nature. Ramakrishna, the 19th century Bengali saint, was also a great devotee of Kali; the western popularity of whom may have contributed to the more modern, equivocal interpretations of this Goddess. Rachel McDermott's work, however, suggests that for the common, modern worshipper, Kali is not seen as fearful, and only those educated in old traditions see her as having a wrathful component. Some credit to the development of Devi must also be given to Samkhya. Commonly referred to as the Devi of delusion, Mahamaya, acting in the confines of (but not being bound by) the nature of the three gunas, takes three forms: Maha-Kali, Maha-Lakshmi and Maha-Saraswati, being her tamas-ika, rajas-ika and sattva-ika forms. In this sense, Kali is simply part of a larger whole.
Like Sir John Woodroffe and Georg Feuerstein, many Tantric scholars (as well as sincere practitioners) agree that, no matter how propitious or appalling you describe them, Shiva and Devi are simply recognizable symbols for everyday, abstract (yet tangible) concepts such as perception, knowledge, space-time, causation and the process of liberating oneself from the confines of such things. Shiva, symbolizing pure, absolute consciousness, and Devi, symbolizing the entire content of that consciousness, are ultimately one and the same—totality incarnate, a micro-macro-cosmic amalgamation of all subjects, all objects and all phenomenal relations between the "two." Like man and woman who both share many common, human traits yet at the same time they are still different and, therefore, may also be seen as complementary.
Worshippers prescribe various benign and horrific qualities to Devi simply out of practicality. They do this so they may have a variety of symbols to choose from, symbols which they can identify and relate with from the perspective of their own, ever-changing time, place and personal level of unfolding. Just like modern chemists or physicists use a variety of molecular and atomic models to describe what is unperceivable through rudimentary, sensory input, the scientists of ontology and epistemology must do the same. One of the underlying distinctions of Tantra, in comparison to other religions, is that it allows the devotee the liberty to choose from a vast array of complementary symbols and rhetoric which suit one's evolving needs and tastes. From an aesthetic standpoint, nothing is interdict and nothing is orthodox. In this sense, the projection of some of Devi's more gentle qualities onto Kali is not sacrilege and the development of Kali really lies in the practitioner, not the murthi.
A "TIME" magazine article of October 27, 1947, used Kali as a symbol and metaphor for the human suffering in British India during its partition that year.
Swami Vivekananda wrote his favorite poem "Kali the Mother" in 1898.
Saint Sarah.
It has been suggested that Saint Sarah, also known as "Sara-la-Kali" ("Sara the Black", )—the mythic patron saint of the Romani (Gypsy) people, whose veneration is centered on Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in southern France—is in fact a manifestation of the Hindu goddess, transported to Europe by the travelling Romani and given a Christian aspect.
In New Age and Neopaganism.
An academic study of Western Kali enthusiasts noted that, "as shown in the histories of all cross-cultural religious transplants, Kali devotionalism in the West must take on its own indigenous forms if it is to adapt to its new environment." The adoption of Kali by the West has raised accusations of cultural appropriation:
A variety of writers and thinkers have found Kali an exciting figure for reflection and exploration, notably feminists and participants in New Age spirituality who are attracted to goddess worship. them, Kali is a symbol of wholeness and healing, associated especially with repressed female power and sexuality. such interpretations often exhibit confusion and misrepresentation, stemming from a lack of knowledge of Hindu history among these authors, only rarely draw upon materials written by scholars of the Hindu religious tradition. The majority instead rely chiefly on other popular feminist sources, almost none of which base their interpretations on a close reading of Kali's Indian background. The most important issue arising from this discussion—even more important than the question of 'correct' interpretation—concerns the adoption of other people's religious symbols. It is hard to import the worship of a goddess from another culture: religious associations and connotations have to be learned, imagined or intuited when the deep symbolic meanings embedded in the native culture are not available.

Cuil

Cuil ( ) was a search engine that organized web pages by content and displayed relatively long entries along with thumbnail pictures for many results. Cuil said it had a larger index than any other search engine, with about 120 billion web pages. It went live on July 28, 2008. Cuil's servers were shut down on September 17, 2010, with later confirmations the service had ended.
Cuil was managed and developed largely by former employees of Google, Anna Patterson and Russell Power. The CEO and co-founder, Tom Costello, has worked for IBM and others. The company had raised $33 million from venture capital firms including Greylock. Cuil's privacy policy, unlike that of other search engines, said it did not store users’ search activity or IP addresses.
History.
Cuil launched in July 2008 with an index of 121,617,892,992 web pages. About one month after launch, Cuil's Product VP and search technologist, Louis Monier, quit the company citing disagreements with the CEO, Tom Costello. On December 19, 2008, "BusinessWeek" listed Cuil as one of the most successful U.S. startups of 2008, based on the amount of money they raised. As of February, 2009, Cuil had 127 billion indexed pages. According to Alexa, the site reached a peak of just over 0.2% of worldwide internet users in late July 2008 and by September 12, 2008, it had dropped to 0.02% and ranked as the 5,340th site by traffic. By October 13, 2008, it had dropped to 0.005% and ranked as the 21,960th site in traffic.
Shutdown.
"PC Magazine" reported that on the morning of September 17, 2010 "employees were told about Cuil's demise [...] and the servers were taken offline five hours later." Laid-off employees were told they would not be paid. The shutdown reportedly came after an acquisition agreement fell through earlier in the week. Their patents were sold to Google and Anna Patterson returned to Google to work for its Search Engine department.
Features.
A user could log into their Facebook account via Cuil, which would then search friend updates for topics, with search links. A user could also send messages to their friends through Cuil.
Cuil worked on an automated encyclopedia called Cpedia, built by algorithmically summarizing and clustering ideas on the web to create encyclopedia-like reports. Instead of displaying search results, Cuil would show Cpedia articles matching the searched terms. This was meant to reduce duplication by combining information into one document.
Cuil was available in 8 languages: English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish. More were planned.
Name.
The Irish ancestry of Anna Patterson's husband Tom Costello sparked the name "Cuil", which the company states is taken from a series of Celtic folklore stories involving a character, Fionn mac Cumhaill, they erroneously refer to as Finn MacCuil . The company says that "Cuil" is Irish for "knowledge" and "hazel".
Some linguists are unsure of this derivation and pronunciation, and note that the modern Irish word for "hazel" is spelled "coll" ("coill" or "cuill" in genitive form, the former spelling having superseded the latter as a result of the "Caighdeán Oifigiúil" reforms of the mid-twentieth century). Foras na Gaeilge, the official governing body of the Irish language, doubted the assertion that 'cuil' means 'knowledge'. "I am unaware myself of the meaning 'knowledge' being with the word 'cuil' in Irish," Stiofán Ó Deoráin, an official on Foras na Gaeilge's terminology committee, said. Even pre-Caighdeán dictionaries such as Dineen do not associate the "cuil" spelling with knowledge or hazel. Dinneen only lists two nouns and one adjective with the spelling "cuil": ""f.", a fly, a horse-fly...", ""f.", a venomous aspect; great eagerness..." and ""gs." of col, as "a.", wicked."
The company name had previously been spelled "Cuill".
Criticism.
Cuil had received widely critical press coverage. Concerns were expressed about the website's slow response times, irrelevant or wrong search results</ref> and in at least one case, inappropriately pornographic images displayed alongside search results. Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Watch questioned the validity of Cuil's claim that it had the world's largest search engine index and criticized it for focusing on size rather than relevance. However, despite reported problems with search results, Net Applications reported that for the last three days of July 2008, Cuil beat Google and Yahoo in the amount of time spent on a site after referral from a search engine.
According to an interview with a Cuil representative, while other Web 2.0 launches using massively parallel processing might fail with a slow down or crash, Cuil's architecture was responding with incomplete, "less-than-relevant results that then appear at the top of users' pages." Cuil's VP of communications Vince Sollitto said the search engine was experiencing heavy first-day overloads and they were "busy putting out fires." Sollitto said Cuil "will only improve with time. It's day one. Traffic is massive. We're new. There are bugs to fix, results to improve."
After the initial critical press coverage, Cuil was alleged to have caused issues for some websites, owing to how the Cuil indexing robot polled certain sites (including under its pre-release name, "Cuill"). Many website owners reported that the Twiceler crawler repeatedly hit their site with randomly generated URLs in an attempt to find pages inaccessible by links. Others reported irrelevant images associated with their listing in Cuil's search results.
Archives.
The web crawls from Cuil were donated to the Internet Archive where they were converted into arc files, which are available for download at http://archive.org/details/cuilcrawl.

Blaptica dubia

The Dubia cockroach (Blaptica dubia), also known as the orange-spotted cockroach, Guyana spotted cockroach, or Argentinian wood cockroach, is a medium-sized species of cockroach with grows to around . They are sexually dimorphic; adult males have full wings covering their body, while females have only tiny wing stubs, their tegmina (forewings) being around a fourth of their body length.
Adults are dark brown to black with somewhat lighter orange spot/stripe patterning sometimes visible only in bright light. Coloration does differ slight with environment and diet from one colonly to another.
"B. dubia" are ovoviviparous, giving birth to live young, and can give birth to 20 to 40 nymphs per month under favorable conditions.
The Dubia cockroach is found in Central and South America, beginning in Costa Rica. It is common from French Guyana and Brazil to Argentina.
Documented specimens have been found in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.
Flight.
While rarely known to fly, adult males have fully developed wings, and pigmented musculature typical of cockroaches able meet the rapid energy requirements of sustained flight. In laboratory test launches from a ramp 2.5 m high, adult male "B. dubia" were able to right their dorso-ventral position and rapidly deploy their wings to control and direct their descent; however, active powered flight did not maintain or increase their altitude. Adult females have only rudimentary forewings and lack the muscles required for flight, and showed no flight control in test launches.
Climbing.
Because they lack developed arolium between their claws, neither adults nor juveniles can climb smooth, vertical surfaces, though juveniles have been known to climb the soft silicone seals in terraria.
Habitat.
Ideal temperature range is the higher end of a range. They will not breed below . They will not moult successfully if the humidity is too low. Dubia roaches can tolerate lower humidity than many other roach species. This species of roach will also sequester more water in its body when well fed upon fruits and water will be released at times of stress.
In captivity, enclosure humidity is less important than a supply of high moisture foods, negating the need to mist the enclosure at all when compared to some other tropical pet insect species. Captive habitats should be kept clean and dry in order to have fecal droppings dry and not provide a medium for bacterial or fungal growth. Vertically stacked egg crates greatly help in this, as does good airflow.
Diet.
The Dubia cockroach is a frugivore that prefers fruits and grains, shunning such high protein sources as meat or waste droppings from other animals. They particularly like semisweet vegetable matter. Appropriate feed for raising Dubia roaches includes: carrots, all manner of tropical fruits (mangos and papayas), apples, avocados, banana, cherries, pears, oranges, strawberries, fresh corn, and lettuce (not iceberg or romaine)—many other leafy greens will be accepted. All grain-based dry cat/dog food, fish food, crested gecko meal and bearded dragon food can also be used to supplement their diet. 
They will also eat wheat bran and germ-based food products like assorted breads and even softened pasta, although such diets must be augmented with edible vegetation and fruit of some sort to provide sufficient water.
High starch tubers like potatoes and yams are eaten only with disdain and seemingly only for their water content.
Use as feeder insect.
"B. dubia" has become a popular feeder insect, particularly among tarantula, amphibian and reptile enthusiasts. Keeping or breeding the insect is made easier by their inability to jump or climb smooth surfaces, relatively slow movement, and rarity of flying. They are also quiet, unlike crickets, and tropical environmental requirements reduce the likelihood of establishment of escapees in colder, dryer climates. "B. dubia" can cause allergic reactions to humans, although they produce relatively little odor compared to many cockroaches.
A study found other cockroaches (Turkestan ("red runner") cockroaches, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, and six-spotted cockroaches) provided a high-protein, low fat nutrition composition similar to crickets, moreso than mealworms or superworm larvae provide. The gut contents of the cockroach, depending on its diet, may provide essential nutrients unavailable from a cockroach with an empty gut. Vitamin and mineral content in studied cockroaches was well represented except for low calcium:phosphorus ratios typical in cockroaches, and relatively low vitamin A and E in captive cockroaches. Supplementation of these nutrients in feeder cockroaches may be advisable. A study of panther chameleons ("Furcifer pardalis") found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates.
Some US states do not allow importation by the general public of "B. dubia", considered by some as an invasive species. A Florida man was arrested on felony charges in 2011 related to ordering 5000000 "B. dubia" over the internet using a doctored permit, typically issued to researchers.
Reproduction.
"B. dubia" is an ovoviparous species, generally giving birth to live young, and pregnancy in one study lasted 48–64 days, in a 26° C environment with alternating 12-hour light and dark photoperiods. It carries the ootheca (egg capsule), which holds about 20-35 eggs, until they are ready to hatch, or may drop it earlier under stress conditions. Adults live for up to 2 years, females slightly longer than males. Growth and reproduction rates are sensitive to environmental conditions, optimally 25–30° C and above 60% relative humidity.
Mold is a deadly hazard to Dubia colonies and moisture is controlled by removing uneaten fresh fruits and vegetables within 24–48 hours of original placement. Nymphs typically use chaff or waste as a housing and food source and many breeders leave a thin layer as a substrate while cleaning off excess every couple of months. It should be noted that many people report allergic reactions after exposure to cockroach waste and so masks and/or respirators are typically used during the cleaning process. Dubia roaches are also popular with breeders in temperate climates as the roaches require warm temperatures to breed. Typically over 75 degrees F and gradient temps of 95-70 F are preferred within their enclosures. Due to the temperature requirements, the likelihood of reproduction outside the colony by escapees is minimized. Males can be territorial however and too many males in a colony often results in fighting, minimized breeding, and death. For this reason most breeders try to keep the colony at a 1 to 4 ratio of males to females and also keep the tubs in a quiet dark environment.

Police state

 
A police state is a state in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic, and political life of the population. A police state typically exhibits elements of totalitarianism and social control, and there is usually little or no distinction between the law and the exercise of political power by the executive.
The inhabitants of a police state experience restrictions on their mobility, and on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views, which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement. Political control may be exerted by means of a secret police force which operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional state.
History of usage.
The Oxford English Dictionary traces the phrase "police State" back to 1851. The German term "Polizeistaat" came into English usage in the 1930s with reference to
totalitarian governments that had begun to emerge in Europe.
Genuine police states are fundamentally authoritarian, and are often dictatorships. However the degree of government repression varies widely among societies. Most regimes fall into some middle ground between the extremes of civil libertarianism and totalitarianism.
In times of national emergency or war, the balance which may usually exist between freedom and national security often tips in favour of security. This shift may lead to allegations that the nation in question has become, or is becoming, a police state.
Because there are different political perspectives as to what an appropriate balance is between individual freedom and national security, there are no definitive objective standards to determine whether the term "police state" applies to a particular nation at any given point in time. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate objectively the truth of allegations that a nation is, or is not becoming, a police state. One way to view the concept of the police state and the free state is through the medium of a balance or scale, where any law focused on removing liberty is seen as moving towards a police state, and any law which limits government oversight is seen as moving towards a free state.
An "electronic police state" is one in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, organize, search, and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens.
Features of police states.
There are many freedom indices which attempt to rate countries according to the amount of freedom they allow their citizens. States which fall at the bottom of these rankings have been described as countries "where basic political rights are absent, and basic civil liberties are widely and systematically denied."
Examples of states with police state-like attributes.
The Soviet Union and its many satellite states, including North Korea and East Germany, were notorious for their extensive and repressive police and intelligence services with, e.g. approximately 2.5% of the East German adult population serving (knowingly or unknowingly) as informants for the Stasi.
Nazi Germany, a dictatorship, was, at least initially, brought into being through a nominal democracy, yet exerted repressive controls over its people. Nazi Germany was indeed a police state; using the SS/SA to assert control over the population in the 1930s.
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders ranked North Korea second last out of 168 countries in a test of press freedom. It has been reported that the only TV channel in North Korea predominately eulogises the country's past leaders Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung. As a result, some locals in Pyongyang have been quoted as stating that their leaders are gods.
Etymology.
The term "police state" was first used in 1851, in reference to the use of a national police force to maintain order, in Austria.
Enlightened absolutism.
Under the political model of enlightened absolutism, the ruler is the "highest servant of the state" and exercises absolute power to provide for the general welfare of the population. This model of government proposes that all the power of the state must be directed toward this end, and rejects codified, statutory constraints upon the ruler's absolute power. Thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes supported this type of absolutist government.
As the enlightened, absolute ruler is said to be charged with the public good, and implicitly infallible by right of appointment, even critical, loyal opposition to the ruler's party is a crime against the state. The concept of loyal opposition is incompatible with these politics. As public dissent is forbidden, it inevitably becomes secret, which, in turn, is countered with political repression via a secret police.
Liberal democracy, which emphasizes the rule of law, focuses on the police state's not being subject to law. Robert von Mohl, who first introduced the rule of law to German jurisprudence, contrasted the "Rechtsstaat" ("legal" or "constitutional" state) with the aristocratic "Polizeistaat" ("police state").
Fictional police states.
Fictional police states have been featured in a number of media ranging from novels to films to video games. George Orwell's "1984" has been described as "the definitive fictional treatment of a police state, which has also influenced contemporary usage of the term".

The Saved is a Dutch documentary released in 1998, it was directed by Paul Cohen and Oeke Hoogendijk.
Plot summary.
"The Saved" movingly portrays the true story of about 600 Jews from the Netherlands and uncovers the shame that haunts them decades subsequent to their experience. This group of individuals was specially selected to live through the Holocaust since they were regarded as beneficial to their nation. Conversely, almost a hundred thousand Jews living in the Netherlands were expelled from the country and murdered by the Nazis. After a high-ranking Hague bureaucrat chose to intercede in order to assist a confidant, he was able to obtain a pact of sorts, which assured the safety of a pair of notable Jews and their households. When news of the deal became public, the Jewish population throughout the Netherlands wrote letters urging to be added onto the exclusive list. It was ultimately expanded to comprise of hundreds of Jews. The group included renowned educators, artists, doctors and scientists. They came to be identified as the Barneveld group.
Sent off to a distant Dutch castle, the Barneveld Jews formed a mini-city shaped after the world of high culture and refinement, which they were accustomed to at home. While the terror of the Holocaust devastated a majority of the European Jewish population, the Barneveld residents existed in comparative ease. Inhabitants carried along with the; home furnishings and porcelain dishware. A school was established and musical performances took place. As opposed to individuals held captive at death camps, the Barnevelders could spend time grooming themselves. A survivor remembers that the women constantly had their hair fashioned in the latest styles and the men never went a day without shaving. Love developed in the Barneveld community due to the close proximity of men and women. A couple met, became engaged and today have four adult children, their lifelong journey together started at the Barneveld home.
As the castle’s population began to rise, the large home became more and more crowded. Some residents compared the situation to being in a large jail cell, with no bars. Soon after food was given out in rations and to make the most out of sleeping quarters, the men and women were divided into barracks styled housing. As time progressed communication with life beyond the castle was severely limited. Collectively, the unit fought to preserve an impression of individual pride and an air of ordinariness. Coping within the castle was difficult for a former resident, because everything that belonged to them was taken away; so it was challenging to show your uniqueness.
In September 1943, the Barneveld clique was relocated to Westerbork, a Nazi labor camp located in Netherlands. The jolt was tremendous, from living in a mansion to residing in camp quarters. They were compelled by the Germans to take part in the expulsion of their neighbors at the camp. The Barnevelder group observed relatives and acquaintances being transferred form Westerbork to Auschwitz. However, the Barnevelders continued to be untouched. While the environment they lived in constantly worsened, the protection of their lives continued. Ultimately, the Barnevelders were moved to Theresienstadt, where they were forced to witness the death of relatives and friends members. Yet their destinies were secure.
Virtually every Barnevelder accomplished to come out of World War II physically whole. Nevertheless the emotional pain lingers, and for many, the feeling of sorrow due to living through the war is even still now hard to conquer. At every point the chosen group was rescued from murder, although some see their continued existence as a blessing and a burden. The discussion of this past situation is one that leads to uproar, by the very people who lived through this experience. At the beginning of the documentary a Barnevelder expresses their displeasure about the creation of the film. This member believes more focus is due on the Dutch Jews that were killed, whose number total 100,000. Not on the extremely small minority that managed to survive throughout the war. All the same, the anomaly that is the Barnevelder group commands to be explored .

Vishnu

Vishnu is the Supreme God of Vaishnavism, one of the three main sects of Hinduism. Vishnu is also known as Narayana and Hari. The Vishnu Sahasranama declares Vishnu as Paramatman (supreme soul) and Parameshwara (supreme God). It describes Vishnu as the all-pervading essence of all beings, the master of—and beyond—the past, present and future, the creator and destroyer of all existences, one who supports, preserves, sustains and governs the universe and originates and develops all elements within. Though he is usually depicted as blue, some other depictions of Vishnu exist as green-bodied, and in the Kurma Purana he is described as colorless and with red eyes.
In Hindu sacred texts, Vishnu is usually described as having the divine blue color of water-filled clouds and as having four arms. He is depicted as holding a padma (lotus flower) in the lower left hand, a unique type of mace used in warfare known as a Kaumodaki gada in the lower right hand, a Panchajanya shankha (conch) in the upper left hand and a discus weapon Sudarshana Chakra in the upper right hand. Vishnu is also described in the Bhagavad Gita as having a 'Universal Form' ("Vishvaroopa" or "Viraata Purusha") Vishvarupa which is beyond the ordinary limits of human perception or imagination. It is said that he owns pancha ayudham (5 weapons)Sudarshanam, Panchajanyam, Komodaki, Nandakam, Shaarngam.
Vishnu's eternal and supreme abode beyond the material universe is called Vaikuntha, which is also known as Paramdhama, the realm of eternal bliss and happiness and the final or highest place for liberated souls who have attained Moksha. Vaikuntha is situated beyond the material universe and hence, cannot be perceived or measured by material science or logic. Vishnu's other abode within the material universe is Ksheera Sagara (the ocean of milk), where he reclines and rests on Ananta Shesha, (the king of the serpent deities, commonly shown with thousand heads). In almost all Hindu denominations, Vishnu is either worshipped directly or in the form of his ten avatars, the most famous of whom are Rama and Krishna. The Puranabharati, an ancient text, describes these as the dashavatara, or the ten avatars of Vishnu. Among the ten described, nine have occurred in the past and one will take place in the future as Lord Kalki, at the end of Kali Yuga, (the fourth and final stage in the cycle of yugas that the world goes through). These incarnations take place in all Yugas in cosmic scales; the avatars and their stories show that gods are indeed unimaginable, unthinkable and inconceivable. The Bhagavad Gita mentions their purpose as being to rejuvenate Dharma, to vanquish those negative forces of evil that threaten dharma and also to display His divine nature in front of all souls.
The Trimurti (three forms) is a concept in Hinduism "in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver, and Shiva the destroyer or transformer." These three deities have also been called "the Hindu triad" or the "Great Trinity", all having the same meaning of three in One. They are the different forms or manifestation of One person the Supreme Being or Narayana/Svayam Bhagavan.
Vishnu is also venerated as Mukunda, which means God who is the giver of mukti or moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirths) to his devotees or the worthy ones who deserve salvation from the material world.
Name.
The traditional explanation of the name "Vishnu" involves the root "," meaning "to settle" (cognate with Latin "vicus," English "-wich" "village," Slavic: vas "-ves"), or also (in the Rigveda) "to enter into, to pervade," glossing the name as "the All-Pervading One".
Yaska, an early commentator on the Vedas, in his Nirukta, (etymological interpretation), defines Vishnu as "vishnu vishateh" "one who enters everywhere". He also writes, "yad vishito bhavati tad vishnurbhavati," "that which is free from fetters and bondages is Vishnu".
Adi Sankara in his commentary on the "Sahasranama" states derivation from "," with a meaning "presence everywhere" ("As he pervades everything, "vevesti", he is called "Vishnu""). Adi Sankara states (regarding Vishnu Purana, 3.1.45): "The Power of the Supreme Being has entered within the universe. The root "" means 'enter into'." Swami Chinmayananda, in his translation of Vishnu Sahasranama further elaborates on that verse: "The root vis means to enter. The entire world of things and beings is pervaded by Him and the Upanishad emphatically insists in its mantra 'whatever that is there is the world of change.' Hence, it means that He is not limited by space, time or substance. Chinmayananda states that that which pervades everything is Vishnu."
Sacred texts - Shruti and Smriti.
Shruti is considered to be solely of divine origin. It is preserved as a whole, instead of verse by verse. It includes the four Vedas (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda) the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the Upanishads with commentaries on them.
Smṛti refers to all the knowledge derived and inculcated after Shruti had been received. Smrti is not 'divine' in origin, but was 'remembered' by later Rishis (sages by insight, who were the scribes) by transcendental means and passed down though their followers. It includes the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana which are Sattva Puranas. These both declare Vishnu as Para Brahman Supreme Lord who creates unlimited universes and enters each one of them as Lord of Universe.
Shruti.
Vaishnava Canon.
The Vaishnava canon presents Vishnu as the supreme being, rather than another name for the Sun God, who also bore the name Suryanarayana and is considered only as a form of Vishnu.
Vedas.
In the Yajurveda, Taittiryia Aranyaka (10-13-1), Narayana sookta, Lord Narayana is mentioned as the supreme being. The first verse of Narayana Sookta mentions the words "paramam padam", which literally mean "highest post" and may be understood as the "supreme abode for all souls". This is also known as Paramdhama, Paramapadam, or Vaikuntha. Rigveda 1:22:20a also mentions the same "paramam padam". This special status is not given to any deity in the Vedas apart from Lord Vishnu/Narayana. Narayana is one of the thousand names of Vishnu as mentioned in the Vishnu Sahasranama. It describes Vishnu as the All-Pervading essence of all beings, the master of—and beyond—the past, present and future, one who supports, sustains and governs the Universe and originates and develops all elements within. This illustrates the omnipresent characteristic of Vishnu. Vishnu governs the aspect of preservation and sustenance of the universe, so he is called "Preserver of the universe".
Vishnu is the Supreme God who takes manifest forms or avatars across various ages or periods to save humanity from evil beings, demons or Asuras, who became powerful after receiving boons from Brahma and Shiva. According to the extant Hindu texts and traditions, Lord Vishnu is considered to be resident in the direction of the "Makara Rashi" (the "Shravana Nakshatra"), which is about coincident with the Capricorn constellation. In some of the extant Puranas, and Vaishnava traditions, Vishnu's eye is considered to be situated at the infinitely distant Southern Celestial Pole.
Following the defeat of Indra and his displacement as the Lord of Heaven or Swarga, Vishnu takes his incarnations or avatars to Earth to save mankind, thus taking the place of the Supreme God, winning recognition by Shaivites and Smarthas.
In the Puranas, Indra frequently appears proud and haughty. These bad qualities are temporarily removed when Brahma and/or Shiva give boons to Asuras or Rakshasas such as Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakashyapu and Ravana, who are then able to defeat Indra in wars between Devas and Asuras. The received boons often made Asuras virtually indestructible.
Indra has no option but to seek help from Vishnu. Indra prays before Vishnu for protection and the Supreme Lord obliges him by taking avatars and generating himself on Earth in various forms, first as a water-dweller (Matsya, fish), then as an amphibious creature (Koorma avatar or Tortoise), then as a half-man-half-animal (Varaha the pig-faced, human-bodied Lord, and Narasimha the Lord with lion's face and claws and a human body). Later, Vishnu appears as human beings (Vamana the short-heighted person), Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Balarama and finally as Kalki for performing his task of protecting his devotees from demons and anti-religious entities. For example, Ravana is the greatest of Shiva's devotees, but is slain by Vishnu, who appears before him as Lord Rama, the son of Dasharatha.
Vishnu's supremacy is attested by his victories over those very powerful entities who are themselves devotees of other Gods such as Brahma or Shiva. It is further attested by the accepted iconography and sculptures of Vishnu in reclining position as producing Brahma emerging from his navel. Brahma the creator is thus created in turn by Vishnu out of his own person. Instead Vishnu takes various avatars to slay or defeat those demons. But it is to be noted that Vishnu also provided boons to Akrurasura, a bear faced demon who was destroyed by Lord Shiva.
Vishnu's actions lowered Indra's ranking among Hindu deities and led to the ascendancy of Vishnu.
Few temples are dedicated to the Sun or Suryanarayana, nor indeed Indra, nor does Indra figure largely in the Hindu religion.
Indra is almost completely absent from the deities considered as the chief or most important deity.
Rigveda.
In the Rigveda, Vishnu is mentioned 93 times. He is frequently invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he helps in killing Vrutra and with whom he drinks Soma. His distinguishing characteristic in the Vedas is his association with light. Two Rigvedic hymns in Mandala 7 are dedicated to Vishnu. In 7.99, Vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth, a characteristic he shares with Indra.
The Rigveda describes Vishnu as younger brother to Indra as Vamana. In Vaishnava canon the 'Vishnu' who is younger brother to Indra is identified as Vamana, Avatar of Vishnu, hence referred to as Vishnu by Vaishnavites. Vishnu is the Supreme God who lives in the highest celestial region, contrasted against those who live in the atmospheric or terrestrial regions. Vishnu is content with mere prayer, unlike almost all of the other gods who receive sacrificial offerings such as Havis, which is given using clarified butter, or Soma.
Later foreign translators have view that Vedas place Indra in a superior position to Vishnu's Avatar of Vamana but in fact Vamana helps Indra by restoring his Kingdom.
An alternate translation is provided by Wilson according to Sayana:
Wilson mentions Griffith's possible translation as a footnote. However the following verse from Rigveda renders the above translation by Wilson more probable.
Wilson offers an alternate translation for Rigveda 10:113:2:
This verse sees Vishnu as one who is glorified by his own strength, while Indra became deserving of honor after having slain Vrutra only in association with other gods.
However Vishnu's praise for other gods does not imply worship. Wilson translates:
The following verses show categorically Vishnu as distinguished from other gods in Rigveda.
Jan Gonda, the late Indologist, states that Vishnu, although remaining in the background of Indra's exploits, contributes by his presence, or is key to Indra's success. Vishnu is more than a mere companion, equal in rank or power to Indra, or sometime the one who made Indra's success possible.
Descriptions of Vishnu as younger to Indra are found in only the hymns to Indra, but in a kathenotheistic religion like that of the Rigveda, each god, for a time, is supreme in the mind of the devotee.
In the Rig Vedic texts, the deity or god referred to as Vishnu is the Sun God, who also bears the name 'Suryanarayana'. By contrast, the 'Vishnu' referred to in 'Vishnu Puranam', 'Vishnu Sahasranamam' and 'Purusha Sooktham' is Lord Narayana, the Consort of Lakshmi. Vaishnavites make a further distinction by extolling the qualities of Vishnu by highlighting his differences from other deities such as Shiva, Brahma or Surya.
Three steps.
Hymn 7.100 refers to the celebrated 'three steps' of Vishnu (as Trivikrama) by which he strode over the universe and in three places planted his step. The 'Vishnu Sukta' (RV 1.154) says that the first and second of Vishnu's strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to men and the third is in the heights of heaven (sky). This last place is described as Vishnu's supreme abode in RV 1.22.20:
Griffith's "princes" are the "sūri", either "inciters" or lords of a sacrifice, or priests charged with pressing the Soma. The verse is quoted as expressing Vishnu's supremacy by Vaishnavites.
Though such solar aspects have been associated with Vishnu by tradition as well as modern-scholarship, he was not just the representation of the sun, as he moves both vertically and horizontally.
In hymns 1.22.17, 1.154.3, 1.154.4 he strides across the earth with three steps, in 6.49.13, 7.100.3 strides across the earth three times and in 1.154.1, 1.155.5,7.29.7 he strides vertically, with the final step in the heavens. The same Veda also says he strode wide and created space in the cosmos for Indra to fight Vritra. By his stride he made dwelling for men possible, the three forming a symbolic representation of the dwelling's all-encompassing nature. This nature and benevolence to men were Vishnu's enduring attributes. As the triple-strider he is known as Tri-vikrama and as Uru-krama, for the strides were wide.
Brahmanas.
The Brahmanas are commentaries on the Vedas and form part of the Shruti literature. They are concerned with the detail of the proper performance of rituals.
In the Rigveda, Shakala Shakha: Aitareya Brahmana Verse 1 declares: "agnir vai devānām avamo viṣṇuḥ paramas, tadantareṇa sarvā anyā devatā" - Agni is the lowest or youngest god and Vishnu is the greatest and the highest God.
The Brahmanas assert the supremacy of Lord Vishnu, addressing him as "Yajnapati", the one whom all sacrifices are meant to please. Lord Vishnu accepts all sacrifices to the demigods and allots the respective fruits to the performer In one incident, a demonic person performs a sacrifice by abducting the Rishis (sages), who meditate by constantly chanting God's name. The sacrifice is meant to destroy Indra. But the rishis, who worship Indra as a demigod, alter one pronunciation of the Vedamantra, reversing the purpose of the sacrifice. When the fruit of the sacrifice is given and the demon is on the verge of dying, he calls to Vishnu, whom he addresses as Supreme Godhead and "the father of all living entities including himself".
Aitareya Brahmana 1:1:1 mentions Vishnu as the Supreme God. But in the Vaishnava canon, in different ages, with Vishnu in different avatars, his relationship with the asuras or demons, was always adversarial. The asuras always caused harm, while the sages and devas or celestial beings, did penance and called to Vishnu for protection. Vishnu always obliged by taking an avatar to vanquish the asuras. In the Vaishnava canon, Vishnu never gave or granted any boons to the asuras, distinguishing him from the gods Shiva and Brahma, who did. He is the only God called upon to save good beings by defeating or killing the asuras.
Sayana writes that in Aitareya Brahmana 1:1:1 the declaration "agnir vai devānām avamo viṣṇuḥ paramas,tadantareṇa sarvā anyā devatā" does not indicate any hierarchy among gods. Even in Rigveda Samhita, avama and parama are not applied to denote rank and dignity, but only to mark place and locality.
In Rigveda 1:108:9,: "yadindrāghnī avamasyāṃ pṛthivyāṃ madhyamasyāṃ paramasyāmuta sthaḥ |" i.e., in the lowest place, the middle (place), and the highest (place). Agni, the fire, has, among the gods, the lowest place; for he resides with man on the earth; while the other gods are either in the air, or in the sky. Vishnu occupies the highest place. The words "avama" and "parama" are understood as 'First' and 'Last' respectively. To support this claim, Sayana adduces the mantra (1,4. As'val. Sr. S. 4, 2), "agnir mukham prathamo devatanam samgathanam uttamo vishnur asit", i.e., Agni was the first of the deities assembled, (and) Vishnu the last.
In the Kausitaki Brahmana (7.1) Agni is called Avarardhya (instead of avama), and Visnu parardhya(instead of parama),i.e., belonging to the lower and higher halves (or forming the lower and higher halves). The Vishnu Purana gives tremendous importance to the worship of Vishnu and mentions that sacrifices are to begin only with both the lighting of fire or 'Agni', pouring of sacrificial offerings to Vishnu in 'Agni' so that those offerings reach and are accepted by Vishnu. Worship of Vishnu through Yagnyas (or Homams) and other rituals, will not achieve the desired result if Agni's role is neglected"."
Muller says "Although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small, the young and the old (Rigveda 1:27:13), this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers, and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others. It would be easy to find, in the numerous hymns of the Veda, passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute."
However this notion is not completely correct as per the following verses, which shows Rigveda describe one or more gods as subject to other god(s).
Smriti.
Vishnu Smriti.
The Vishnu Smṛti, is one of the later books of the Dharmashastra tradition of Hinduism and the only one that focuses on the bhakti tradition and the required daily puja to Vishnu, rather than the means of knowing dharma. It is also known for its handling of the controversial subject of the practice of sati (self-immolation of a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre). The text was composed by an individual or group. The author(s) created a collection of the commonly known legal maxims that were attributed to Vishnu into one book, as Indian oral culture began to be recorded more formally.
Bhagavata Purana.
Vishnu is the only Bhagavan as declared in the Bhagavata 1:2:11 in the verse: "vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate", translated as "Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance as Brahman, Paramātma and Bhagavan."
Vishnu Purana.
In the Vishnu Purana (6:5:79) the personality named Parashara Rishi defines six bhagas:
Jiva Gosvami explains the verse in Gopala Champu (Pūrva 15:73) and Bhagavata Sandarbha 46:10:
Theological attributes.
The actual number of Vishnu's auspicious qualities is countless, although his six most-important "divine glories" are:
Other important qualities attributed to Vishnu are Gambhirya (inestimatable grandeur), Audarya (generosity), and Karunya (compassion). Natya Shastra lists Vishnu as the presiding deity of the Sṛngara rasa.
The Rigveda says: Vishnu can travel in three strides. The first stride is the Earth. The second stride is the visible sky. The third stride cannot be seen by men and is the heaven where the gods and the righteous dead live. (This feature of three strides also appears in the story of his avatar Vamana/Trivikrama.) The Sanskrit for "to stride" is the root "kram"; its reduplicated perfect is "chakram" ( grade) or "chakra" (zero-grade), and in the Rigveda he is called by epithets such as "" = "he who has made 3 strides". The Sanskrit word "chakra" also means "wheel". That may have suggested the idea of Vishnu carrying a chakra.
Five forms.
In Shree Vaishnavism, another school dating from around the 10th century AD, Vishnu assumes five forms:
Relations with deities.
Shiva.
The three gods of the Trimurti clan are inseparable and in harmony in view of their common vision and universal good. They are perfectly ideal in all respects.
Both Asuras and Devas played supportive roles in this story by keeping company with Vishnu in his incarnated forms. Hanuman is a vanara who is completely dedicated to Rama. He gives Vishnu company and obeys his command, while playing an important part in Rama's life. He is regarded in Vaishnava canon because it is through blessings that Hanuman is born. Thus, Hanuman, Vishnu's constant companion, with his idol appearing temples of Rama, Krishna and Narasimha, i.e. all of Vishnu's avatars, is considered by Vaishnavas.
Syncretic forces produced stories in which the two deities were shown in cooperative relationships and combined forms. Harihara is the name of a combined deity form of both Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara). This dual form, which is also called Harirudra, is mentioned in the "Mahabharata".
Lakshmi.
Vishnu's consort is Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth (also known as Maya). The Samvit (the primary intelligence/dark matter) of the universe is Vishnu, while the other five attributes emerge from this samvit and hence Maya or dark energy of the universe is Lakshmee is his ahamata, activity, or Vishnu's Power.This power of God, Maya or Shakti, is personified and has multiple names: Parvathi, Saraswathi, Shree, Lakshmi, Maya, Vishnumaya or Mahamaya. She is said to manifest as Kriyashakti, (Creative Activity) and Bhutishakti (Creation). This world requires Vishnu's creativity. He therefore needs Lakshmi to always be with Him. Her various avatars as Lord Vishnu's consorts are Varahavataram (Bhoodevi) or Bhoomi, Ramavataram Seeta, Krishnavataram (Radha and Rukmini) and Venkateshwara (Padmavathi Vedavati).
Garuda.
Vishnu's mount "(Vahana)" is Garuda, the eagle. Vishnu is commonly depicted as riding on his shoulders.
Iconography.
According to various Puranas, Vishnu is the ultimate omnipresent reality and is shapeless and omnipresent. However, a strict iconography governs his representation, whether in pictures, icons, or idols:
Vishnu is always to be depicted holding four attributes:
To this may be added, conventionally, the vanamaala flower garland, Vishnu's bow (Shaarnga) and his sword Nandaka. A verse of the Vishnu Sahasranama stotram states;"vanamālī gadhī shārngī shanki chakri cha nandaki / shrīmān nārāyaņo vişņo vāsudevo abhirakşatu//"; translation: Protect us Oh Lord Narayana who wears the forest garland,who has the mace, conch, sword and the wheel. And who is called Vishnu and the Vasudeva.
In general, Vishnu's body is depicted in one of the following three ways:
Avatars.
Ten avatars ("dashavatara") of Vishnu are the most prominent: Apart from the most prominent incarnations there are believed to more.
The most commonly believed incarnations of Vishnu are:
Some versions of the above list include Hayagreeva among the Dashavataras while some include Buddha as ninth avatar of Vishnu. Another 22 avatars are given in Chapter 3, Canto 1 of the Bhagavata Purana, although it states that "the incarnations of the Lord are innumerable, like rivulets flowing from inexhaustible sources of water".
Beyond Hinduism.
Sikhism.
Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism mentions Vishnu, one verse goes:-
Others.
James Freeman Clarke, Richard Leviton, James Cowles Prichard, and others have noted the similarities between Vishnu and Ancient Egyptian God' Horus.
During an excavation in an abandoned village of Russia in the Volga region, archaeologist Alexander Kozhevin excavated an ancient idol of Vishnu. The idol dates from between the 7th and 10th centuries. In the interview Kozhevin, stated that, "We may consider it incredible, but we have ground to assert that Middle-Volga region was the original land of Ancient Rus. This is a hypothesis, but a hypothesis, which requires thorough research."
Thousand names of Vishnu.
Vishnu's many names and followers are collected in the Vishnu Sahasranama, (Vishnu's thousand names) from within the larger work "Mahabharata". The character Bheeshma recites the names before Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, praising him (Vishnu) as the supreme god. These Sahasranama are regarded as the essence of all Vedas by followers of Vaishnavism, who believe sincere chanting of Vishnu Sahasranama results in spiritual well-being and a greater awareness of God.
The names are generally derived from the A"nantakalyanaguna"s (meaning: infinite auspicious attributes). Some names of Vishnu are:
According to the Siddhartha-samhita there are twenty-four forms of Lord Vishnu. The twenty-four forms are

The Del-Byzanteens

The Del-Byzanteens was a New York-based No Wave band active in the early 1980s. The band comprised Phil Kline (vocals, guitar); Jim Jarmusch (vocals, keyboards); Philippe Hagen (bass); Josh Braun (percussion, drums); and Dan Braun (drums, percussion). Luc Sante wrote the lyrics to some of their songs, while James Nares sometimes contributed as a percussionist, and occasionally John Lurie performed with them on stage.
They released a 12" EP: "Girl's Imagination" (1981), an LP: "Lies To Live By" (1982), and a 7" single: "Draft Riot" (1982). In 1985-86 they recorded two more songs ("The Last Time" and "Fascination"), which were never finished or officially released.
"At that time everyone in New York had a band," Jarmusch recalled in an interview "The Washington Post" (1984). "The idea was that you didn't have to be a virtuoso musician to have a band. The spirit was more important than having technical expertise, and that influenced a lot of filmmakers." According to Sante, they were "a band that insouciantly blended high and low, virtuosity and amateurism, calypso and science fiction, pots and pans and drones and the Supremes. They released several records, on a British label, which did very well in the former Yugoslavia."
They played a number of concerts at clubs such as CBGB, Hurrah and the Mudd Club in New York City. Two of their songs were featured in Wim Wenders' 1982 film "The State of Things". At the time, "Hot Press" said that their debut LP was "a debut equal to anything out of New York these past six years", and "Melody Maker" described it as "mighty stuff... You are strongly urged to investigate this record... outstanding." Like the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, many of its members have gone on to become famous in their own right, making music (Phil Kline), art (James Nares), and writing (Luc Sante).
Their back catalogue has never been re-issued on CD, and Del-Byzaneens vinyl is a rare sight on the second-hand market. However, "Girl's Imagination" was featured on the Beggars Banquet's 1999 compilation "Pspyched!", and again on the Gomma compilation "Anti-NY" in 2001, while "My Hands Are Yellow (from the job that i do)" was released on "New York Noise Vol 2", in 2003. Three of their shows at the Hurrah club were filmed, in their entirety, by Merrill Aldighieri. In early 2011 she released a 52 minute "hand-made" DVD, "Eskimo Lounge Music", featuring live footage from these performances, interfoiled with recent interviews with the band members.

Slugburger

A slugburger (originally "weeksburger") is a traditional southern delicacy found in Northeast Mississippi, particularly Corinth, Iuka, West Tennessee, and northwest Alabama. Consisting of a patty made from a mixture of beef or pork and an inexpensive extender such as soybeans, it is deep fried in oil. It is typically served on a bun with mustard, pickles, onion, and a side of French fries.
History.
John Weeks brought his hamburger recipe to Corinth in 1917 from Chicago. Weeks had his hamburger meat ground to specification by local butchers, which included potato flakes and flour. These small hamburgers were originally called Weeksburgers. Sometime before 1950, soy grits replaced the potato and flour and has remained the primary extender. According to town legend the term "slugburger" comes from the slang term for a nickel.
In Tupelo, Mississippi, slugburgers are known as doughburgers and often contain flour and egg rather than soy grits. A local drive-in "Johnny's", that Elvis Presley frequented as a boy, serves doughburgers.
Festival.
Each July the citizens of Corinth as well as those who travel from miles around descend on the town to pay tribute to this local culinary specialty at the annual Slugburger Festival. This three-day event offers rides, live entertainment and food.

Willson's Woods Park

Willson's Woods Park is a park located in Mount Vernon, New York. The Park is owned by Westchester County and operated by its Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation. Acquired in 1924, Willson's Woods is one of the oldest parks in the County's parks system. The Park was named for the former owner of the land, Charles Hill Willson of the Willson & Adams Lumber Company. The park is flanked to the east by the Hutchinson River Parkway and by Pelham Lake. It was built with the northern entrance passing under the now defunct New York, Westchester and Boston Railway line, and the southern under the still working New Haven Line. 
Consisting of twenty-three acres, the Park contains amenities and facilities for a variety of activities, including fishing, hiking, ice skating, picnicking, and swimming. In 2010, Willson's Woods received the highest inspection scores out of all the county's active parks.
Swimming Facility.
Willson's Woods Park has been home to a swimming facility since 1928.
The construction of a one-million-gallon swimming pool and two-story, Tudor Revival style bathhouse on the Park's property began in 1927. Construction was completed in 1928, and the facility opened on Independence Day of that year under the name Willson's Woods Pool. A swimming competition was held at the Pool on opening day.
Following the summer of 2004, Willson's Woods Pool underwent a major renovation, transforming it into what the Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation has called an "aquatic playground." Although the bathhouse remained virtually the same, the old pool was replaced with a wave pool, two eighteen-foot water slides, a small pool and play structure for young children (called the Aqua Playground), and a splash pad (called the Sprayground). The new facility opened for the summer of 2005 under the name Willson's Waves. The original plans for the renovation included two additional water slides and had the wave pool being a larger size; however, these aspects of the project had to be abandoned due to monetary reasons.
In most instances, people wishing to enter Willson's Waves must possess an identity card called a Park Pass. Park Passes are available for purchase by residents of Westchester County at the facility during its operating season as well as at various locations throughout the County. People using one of the Park's reserved picnic areas can use their picnic permit in place of a Park Pass for the day of their reservation. Residents of the County who would like to enter Willson's Waves but do not wish to purchase a Park Pass can pay a higher admission rate as along as they present sufficient identification and proof of their residencey in the County; however, people who enter in this manner are not allowed to bring other adults or children into the facility with them.
Park Pass holders have the option of purchasing a Season Swim Pass for an additional fee; the Season Swim Pass, valid for one summer, allows an individual or a family to pay a single upfront fee instead of paying admission on a daily basis.
There currently are plans to expand Willson's Waves by adding the two water slides that were intended to be part of the 2004 renovation. In addition, replicas of the original bathhouse windows are to be installed, but no further improvements are planned for the bathhouse in order to maintain the building's architectural aesthetic and have it declared a historic site of some kind.
Picnicking.
Located in Willson's Woods Park are areas that are available for use for group picnics. Reservations must be made in advance with the Group Permit Office of the Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation by either a resident of Westchester County or a business that is located in the County. The Park has three picnic areas, each able to accommodate up to seventy-five people, located on its southeastern property. There also is a pavilion, called DeMatteo Terrace (in honor of "valued County employee" Charles "Chuck" J. DeMatteo), located on the second story of Willson's Waves bathhouse that can hold up to one hundred people.

Mediocre (album)

Mediocre () is the Grammy Award and Latin Grammy nominated debut album of Mexican singer and actress Ximena Sariñana, released in the United States on . "Mediocre" reached #10 on Billboard's Latin Pop Albums, and spawned the hit single "Vidas Paralelas" ("Parallel Lives"). The album gained additional attention when the iTunes Store featured Sariñana's song "Normal" as the "canción de la semana" — iTunes' free Latino song of the week — during the week of .
"Mediocre" garnered good reviews from many critics, receiving five stars from SoMinty, four stars from "Time Out", and four stars from "Rolling Stone" magazine. Many critics praise "Mediocre" for being an eclectic album with a diverse style of songs featuring pop, rock, alternative, and nueva canción styles.
Theme.
Sariñana clarified that her title choice, "Mediocre", means to denounce mediocrity and conformity. She explained in an interview, "This whole idea of the perfect woman of the ‘50s is what the title song is about... There was no possibility of being something different, and that, in turn, created a prototype of a woman who was mediocre."
The album artwork for "Mediocre" meant to emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sariñana elaborated, "The cover is a take on the idea that women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and embroidering perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: "It’s not to say that the material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but there are some people out there who like to poke fun at the title."
Recording and production.
Recording commenced in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 2007 and finished in August 2007. Various studio musicians were brought in for the recording of "Mediocre". Bruno Bressa, the drummer of Volován, helped in the production process of the album, and also played the keyboard and tabla for its tracks. Argentine producer Tweety González and Uruguayan producer Juan Campodónico produced the album in 2008.
Musical style.
"Mediocre" showcases rock, pop, and hip-hop influences. Jimmy Draper of Time Out New York describes the musical style as "full of buoyant, jazz-inflected pop with occasional electronic underpinnings and outbursts of rock". The album opens with "Mediocre", a heavily rock-influenced track, leading to the pop single "Vidas Paralelas". Sariñana relies heavily upon the piano in the pop track "Normal", which also features brass and vocal harmonies. "La Tina" displays a hip-hop influence through its use of electronic beats. "No Vuelvo Más" features Sariñana's use of additional vocal harmonies, as well as acoustic guitars. Ron Bronson of SoMinty points out that "Un Error" and "Sintiendo Rara" are slower songs reminiscent of Sariñana's interest in jazz.
Lissette Corsa of Orlando Weekly points out that "Mediocre" follows a unique contemporary jazz style. Corsa praises "Mediocre", calling it a "deftly crafted alt-pop record", but notes that "it’s the electronic embellishments, dub effects and jazz trimmings—in the form of loose piano lines, subtle tempo changes and vocal improvisations—that make it unique." Corsa also praises Sariñana, whose "lyrics exhibit a remarkable depth for someone her age", saying Sariñana has "a keen understanding of composition and melodic structure".
Genres.
Since "Mediocre" incorporates many different styles of music, the exact genre of the album is disputed. Allmusic classifies "Mediocre" as a pop/rock album with adult alternative pop/rock and adult contemporary stylings. However, the iTunes Store classifies "Mediocre" as an "alternativo" album to accentuate its Latin American style as well as its alternative style. SoMinty classifies "Mediocre" as an indie pop album, and Rhapsody categorizes "Mediocre" as "nueva canción", or "new song".
Critical reception.
Criticism of "Mediocre" has been mostly positive, and many critics highly acclaim the album. The Rolling Stone staff rated "Mediocre" four stars, and "Rolling Stone"s average viewer rating is four and a half stars. Mark Kemp, a music journalist from "Rolling Stone", called "Mediocre" one of the strongest debuts from a female singer-songwriter since Norah Jones' "Come Away with Me", exclaiming "There's sultry torch songs, folky ballads, smart rock — and not a bum track among them." Ron Bronson, a music journalist from the website SoMinty, awarded "Mediocre" five stars. He describes Sariñana's voice on "Mediocre" as being "something along the lines of Nellie McKay meets countryman Julieta Venegas meets Sia. voice is original, in other words. Very original... If you have any real desire to listen to music "en español", you'll be hard pressed to find a better singer on the indie scene these days. Ximena has got chops, folks." Ernesto Sánchez of People en Español labeled "Mediocre" "one of the most promising Latin Music albums of ". Eric Danton of The "Hartford Courant" pointed out that "her prospects in the United States are less predictable thanks to a fragmented radio landscape and what for many English-speaking listeners is a language barrier."

USS Newcastle Victory (AK-233)

USS "Newcastle Victory" (AK-233) was a "Boulder Victory"-class cargo ship acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. She served in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations through the end of the war, and then returned to the United States of America for disposal.
Victory built in California.
"Newcastle Victory", built by Permanente Metals Corporation, Richmond, California, was laid down 21 August 1944; launched 17 October; and named 29 October. One of many Victory ships ordered by the U.S. Maritime Commission, she was one of ten taken over by the Navy to carry ammunition; and commissioned 23 November, Lt. Comdr. J. D. Edwards, USNR, in command.
World War II operations.
After shakedown off the California coast, she put in at San Francisco, California, 12 December and took on a cargo of ammunition. Upon completion of loading at Port Chicago, California, and at San Pablo, California, she steamed for Pearl Harbor 28 December.
"Newcastle Victory" departed Pearl Harbor 17 January 1945, arrived Guam 1 February, departed 6 February in a small convoy bound for Ulithi, where she anchored 8–17 February. She then returned to Guam and offloaded ammunition for the newly commissioned ammunition depot there.
She departed 7 March for San Francisco via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. At Pearl Harbor she received a three-week availability, which brought new ordnance and radar equipment and habitability improvements. She departed Pearl Harbor 17 April, arrived San Francisco 23 April, and then took on a new cargo of ammunition at Port Chicago, California.
She steamed towards Leyte 15 May, via Pearl Harbor, Saipan, and Ulithi. During June she serviced ships in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, in the Philippine Islands; during July she returned to Ulithi and there assumed duties as station issues ship.
"Newcastle Victory" was directed to proceed to Seattle, Washington, in November 1945, where she was laid up in a reduced manning status until May 1946, when she was directed to report to the 3d Naval District for disposal. She steamed in early May via the Panama Canal and Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, where she offloaded her ammunition.
Post-war decommissioning and career.
She reported to Commander, 3d Naval District, New York, 30 May and decommissioned 21 June. She was stricken from the Navy List 3 July 1946. Returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission, she was laid up in the Hudson River, New York. She was reactivated in 1955 and leased to the United Fruit Lines under a general agency agreement.

Hydrox (breathing gas)

Hydrox, a gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, was used as a breathing gas in very deep diving. It allows divers to descend several hundred metres.
Precautions are necessary when using hydrox, since mixtures containing more than a few percent of both oxygen and hydrogen are explosive if ignited. Hydrogen is the lightest gas (half the weight of helium) but still has a narcotic potential and may cause hydrogen narcosis.
History.
Although the first reported use of hydrogen seems to be by Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794), who had guinea pigs breathe it, the actual first uses of this gas in diving are usually attributed to trials by the Swedish engineer, Arne Zetterström in 1945.
Zetterström showed that hydrogen was perfectly usable to great depths. Sadly, following a fault in using the surface equipment, he died during a demonstration dive. The study of hydrogen was not resumed until several years later by the United States Navy and by the Compagnie maritime d'expertises (Comex), initially during their Hydra I and Hydra II experiments, in 1968 and 1969. Comex subsequently developed procedures allowing dives between 500 and 700 metres (1650 to 2300 feet) in depth, while breathing gas mixtures based on hydrogen, called hydrox (hydrogen-oxygen) or hydreliox (hydrogen-helium-oxygen).
Use.
Hydrox may be used to combat high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS), commonly occurring during very deep dives.
These studies scored a resounding success with a simulated dive to , by Theo Mavrostomos on 20 November 1990 at Toulon, during the COMEX Hydra X decompression chamber experiments. This dive made him "the deepest diver in the world".
Biochemical decompression.
The United States Navy has evaluated the use of bacterial flora to speed decompression from hydrox diving.

<doc id="19334844" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19334844" title="The Children's Study Home">
The Children's Study Home

The Children’s Study Home started in 1865 in as Springfield Home for Friendless Women and Children, Inc. Springfield, Massachusetts was the first charitable institution in Western Mass. At that time, the Study Home addressed women’s issues, family welfare, emotional rehabilitation and child development. Its first President was Rachel Capen Merriam. The home responded to problems facing women and children at the end of the American Civil War era.
On April 27, 1865, the home received its incorporation from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. A “well built and commodious house” on Union Street was purchased. According to Article 2 of the 1865 Constitution, the “object of this institution shall be to provide a temporary home for friendless and destitute women and children; and to give them employment and instruction with the ultimate design of providing for them a more permanent situation, or fitting them to maintain themselves.” At the end of its first year in March 1866, forty women and twenty children had received services from the Home for Friendless Women and Children.
In 1866, the Massachusetts Legislature was asked to allocate $2,000 to the organization which was granted with the provision that the community in Springfield provide a match of funds through private donations. The community raised $2,123.91 along with more tangible donations such as flour and clothes. The home came to be known as Springfield’s first public charity.
Throughout the 19th century the home continued to serve women and children enduring some type of difficulty due to the war, immigration, physical abuse, sexual abuse, imprisonment, illness, drug addiction, and/or unmarried and pregnant.
In 1870, after outgrowing the Union Street home, and after the donations of many, a new additional facility was constructed on Buckingham Street, a Children’s Home, and its grand opening was in May 1871. The first school was established in 1873. The Union Street home then had the space needed for females.
Around 1872 Rachel Capen Merriam transferred leadership to a new President, Mrs. William Rice.
During the following decades and into the new century, the troubles of society commanded growth of facilities and growth of donations. In 1897, a home on Williams Street opened, a Home for Women, and an addition to the Buckingham Street home was added. By 1926 the structure on Buckingham Street was demolished due to structural condition. The Sherman Street address was added in November 1928 at St. Peter’s Rectory. The Williams Street facility became known as the only home for unwed mothers in the city. At this point, the managerial structure of the corporation had been divided into three divisions with Mrs. Edward Bradford chairing the William Street committee; Mrs. Frederick Everett chairing the Buckingham Street committee; and Mrs. Robert Cooley chairing the newly created Sherman St. Committee.
The cottage was opened in 1935. Eventually a third building was added to Sherman Street to house administration, laundry and staff.
Due to findings of the Council of Social Agencies, the Home for Unmarried mothers was closed forever in 1938. The corporation would now focus exclusively on children’s needs. The Home at this time was providing temporary care for youngsters facing some type of disruption in their family life. In 1940, the United Fund and the Community Council asked the Home to consider a different program for emotionally disturbed boys and girls up to age 12. This was accepted and that work began. At this time, the agency became known as The Children's Study Home to reflect the diagnostic and treatment work we pioneered for children with emotional and behavioral problems.
By 1959, it became necessary to address the Home’s mission and future direction due to decline in admissions. The board voted in 1961 to accept recommendations for a treatment oriented institution for emotionally disturbed boys and girls ages 6 to 12. In addition, the recommendation called for a foster home program followed by a group home arrangement for children ready to re-enter the community.
On February 28, 1966, the Kathleen Thornton School, named after the director of the agency from 1940–1960 opened as a school to educate youngsters not able to function in public school.
The agency was again expanded in 1976 to include treatment of teenagers facing emotional challenges. By 1979 a campus in the Sixteen Acres section of Springfield was acquired to meet the special needs of this program. The Mill Pond School, houses a middle school for grades 6–8 and a high school, grades 9–12 and today, still includes academic, administrative and recreational components, and in 2001 added SHARP 1, an adolescent residential program.
The Children's Study Home began providing services for Cape Cod and the Islands in 1993 with a focus on adolescent and family services and today has expanded to provide additional services for youth and families.
The Children's Study Home Inc. today lives through its mission of being a charitable organization devoted to identifying and solving child and family problems for the community.

Francis Kompaon

Francis Kompaon, born 16 January 1986 in Rabaul, is a T46 Papua New Guinean athlete.
He represented Papua New Guinea at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, competing in athletics in the one hundred metre sprint, T46 category. With a time of 11.10 seconds, he finished second in the final, five hundredths of a second behind Australia's Heath Francis. It was Papua New Guinea's first ever Olympic or Paralympic medal, and only the second ever Olympic or Paralympic medal won by a Pacific Islander; Tongan boxer Paea Wolfgramm had won a silver at the 1996 Olympics. He also competed in the 200 metre sprint, finishing ninth overall in the heats, with a time of 23.30 seconds. Kompaon was his country's flagbearer at the Games' opening ceremony, and was one of fifteen competitors (out of over 4000) selected to carry the torch during the Paralympic torch relay in Beijing.
He had previously won several gold medals at regional competitions in Oceania, and had finished fourth in the 200m sprint for élite athletes with disabilities at the 2006 Commonwealth Games.
Papua New Guinea's sports minister Dame Carol Kidu said that Kompaon's Paralympic medal had "raised the issue of disability in Papua New Guinea to a level that it has never been". In direct response to Kompaon's medal, Prime Minister Michael Somare promised that the government would increase funding for disability sports.
In 2009, Kompaon enrolled in sports management at Griffith University in Queensland.
He qualified as one of two athletes to represent Papua New Guinea at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, and was again selected to be his country's flag-bearer during the Games' opening ceremony competed in the men's 100m and 200m T46 (the category for upper limb amputees). In the 200m, he finished sixth (of eight) in his heat, with a new personal best of 23.05, and did not advance to the final. In his main event, the 100m, he finished third (of seven) in heat 2, qualifying for the final as the fastest loser overall with a personal best time of 11.21 (fifth fastest overall over the three heats). In the final, however, he was unable to repeat his Beijing performance; he "injured his hamstring near the finish line" and finished seventh (of eight) in 12.28.

Ulrichsberg gathering

The Ulrichsberg gathering is an annual reunion for veterans of the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS held at the Ulrichsberg mountain in Austria. Since 1958, it has been held each year on the first Sunday of October. The purpose of the gathering is to commemorate those who were killed in the Second World War and their "decent fulfilment of their duties" as soldiers. 
At the entrance, the old SS slogan "Die Ehre Unserer Soldaten Heisst Treue" (the honour of our soldiers is their loyalty) is carved in large elaborate letters on the wall.
One of the particular features of the Ulrichsberg memorial site is the so-called "Ehrenhain" (Grove of Honour) where one can find several plaques with commemorative inscriptions and armorial symbols, among them one for the Kameradschaft IV, several for the "Kameradschaft ehemaliger Gebirgsjäger" (the association of former Wehrmacht mountain troops), some from a number of units of "Freiwilligen" (volunteers) and the Wehrmacht from different countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Spain, and Latvia. 
The event has drawn criticism as a festival for old Nazis that serves as a feeding ground for neo-Nazis. The late Austrian politician and long-time leader of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), Jörg Haider, disagreed and spoke at the gathering in year 2000: "It can't be so that the history of our fathers and grandparents, due to dubious commentaries, is reduced to a single catalogue of crimes, and that the part they played in history is just thrown back in their faces," saying that "Most who come here are not old Nazis or neo-Nazis. They are old citizens who suffered during the war and lost their youth to the war and then began to rebuild." He received a spontaneous standing ovation from the crowd.

Eric Karjaluoto

Eric Karjaluoto is a designer, entrepreneur, writer, and former painter. He is a founding partner at smashLAB, a strategic interactive agency located in Vancouver, Canada.
Background.
Karjaluoto studied at the Emily Carr Institute in Vancouver. Prior to focusing on design he worked in production at the Prince George Citizen newspaper and spent several years working as an exhibited painter.
Design.
In 2000, Karjaluoto and hometown friend Eric Shelkie started smashLAB in Prince George, BC with two computers, a few hundred dollars and little business experience. “On our first project we made $400, about $2 an hour,” Karjaluoto revealed in an article from the Globe and Mail. "We took the hardest path, in Prince George, during a recession and after the dot-com bubble had burst.” smashLAB gradually built up a roster of local clients and eventually moved the office to Vancouver in 2004. 
In 2007—inspired in part by the Oscar-winning Al Gore film An Inconvenient Truth—Karjaluoto and his partner spearheaded "Design Can Change", an effort to unite designers to address climate change. TIME Magazine selected Design Can Change for inclusion in its annual Design 100—a list of "the people and ideas behind today's most influential design".
Writing.
Karjaluoto's blog "offers critical thought and discussion of topics relating to communication design and designers". One post in particular, titled "9 to 5 = average" sparked a flame war and prompted a new media organization to create a live panel discussion based on the topic. 
His articles have been republished by web publications such as Taxi Design and Creative Review. He has also written articles for .net Magazine and Applied Arts, and excerpts of his white paper, "A Primer on Social Media", were published in the May 2008 issue of Advertising Age.
Authored the book "Speak Human" that tackles the topic of design and communication from the point of view of the ways in which people interact with the objects around us. In it 'Karjaluoto lays out several methods in which small companies can retain the hearts of customers.' 
Speaking.
Karjaluoto has presented at events put on by design associations such as HOW Magazine, AIGA, and New Media BC. He also taught branding in the Digital Design program at Vancouver Film School.

Aptenia cordifolia

Aptenia cordifolia is a species of succulent plant in the iceplant family known by the common names heartleaf iceplant and baby sun rose. Perhaps the most common plant seen under this name is actually "Aptenia" 'Red Apple', a hybrid with red flowers and bright green leaves, whose parents are "A. cordifolia" and "A. (Platythyra) haeckeliana". The true species of "A. cordifolia" has magenta purple flowers and more heart-shaped, mid-green, textured leaves.
Native to southern Africa, this species has become widely known as an ornamental plants. This is a mat-forming perennial herb growing in flat clumps on the ground from a woody base. Stems reach up to about 60 centimeters long. The bright green leaves are generally heart-shaped and up to 3 centimeters long. They are covered in very fine bumps. Bright pink to purplish flowers appear in the leaf axils and are open during the day. The fruit is a capsule just over a centimeter long.
The hybrid, "A." 'Red Apple', has, in some areas, escaped cultivation and now grows as an introduced species. Its far more vigorous growth and ability to root from small bits of stem makes it a poor choice for planting adjacent to wild lands.

Philippicus (general)

Philippicus or Philippikos (, fl. 580s–610s) was an East Roman general, "comes excubitorum", and brother-in-law of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602). His successful career as a general spanned three decades, chiefly against the Sassanid Persians.
Career under Maurice.
Little is known about Philippicus's early years. He was married to Gordia, sister of Emperor Maurice (reigned 582–602), probably in 583, and was at some point raised to the high rank of "patricius". At about the same time, he was appointed "comes excubitorum" (Commander of the Excubitors, the imperial bodyguard), and in 584, he replaced John Mystacon as "magister militum" for the East, thus becoming responsible for the conduct of the ongoing war against the Sassanid Persians.
He commanded numerous raids into Persian territory in 584–585, ravaging the plains near Nisibis, and making inroads in the regions of Arzanene and eastern Mesopotamia. During the same period, he actively tried to improve the discipline and efficiency of his troops.
Philippicus spent the winter of 585-586 in Constantinople, and returned to his headquarters in Amida in the spring. After Persian peace proposals were rejected, he advanced his troops to the frontier, where he defeated a superior Persian force under Kardarigan at the Battle of Solachon. He then proceeded to invade and plunder Arzanene and laid siege to the fortress of Chlomaron. However, the approach of a Persian relief army panicked the Romans, who fled in disorder back into Roman territory. There, possibly due to illness, he handed over command of his army to his "hypostrategos" (lieutenant general) Heraclius, the father of the future emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641). In spring 587, he was again ill, and unable to campaign in person. He assigned two thirds of his army to Heraclius and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, and sent them to raid Persian territory. He did not campaign himself that year, and in the winter, he set off towards Constantinople. On his way, he learned that he had been replaced by Priscus.
When Priscus arrived in the East, however, the soldiers refused to obey him, and elected the "dux" of Phoenice Libanensis, Germanus, as their leader in his stead. Philippicus, who was soon re-appointed as commander of the East, could only assume his command after the mutiny was quelled through the intervention of the Patriarch of Antioch. After a public reconciliation with his troops, in the summer of 589 he campaigned against the city of Martyropolis, which had recently fallen to the Persians through the treacherous defection of a Roman officer named Sittas. Philippicus failed to retake it and was defeated by a Persian relief force led by Mahbodh and Aphrarat, after which he was replaced by Comentiolus.
Except for a diplomatic mission in 590 to the recently deposed Persian ruler Khosrau II (r. 590–628), who had taken refuge in Roman territory, Philippicus disappears from the scene for several years. In 598, he was briefly appointed general in the ongoing war in the Balkans, and is credited by some sources with a victory over the Avars in Thrace, although this is most likely due to a confusion with general Priscus.
Career under Phocas and Heraclius.
At some point in 602, suspicions fell upon him of plotting against Emperor Maurice, since a prophecy stated that the name of Maurice's successor would begin with a "Φ" (Phi). Indeed soon after, Maurice was deposed and killed by a revolt in the Balkan army led by Phocas. As a close associate of Maurice, Philippicus was tonsured and forced to enter a monastery in Chrysopolis. He was still at the monastery when Heraclius overthrew Phocas in 610. The new emperor recalled him and sent him to negotiate with Phocas's brother, Comentiolus, who commanded the eastern army. Comentiolus imprisoned him and intended to execute him, but Philippicus was saved when Comentiolus himself was murdered.
In 612, he was again appointed by Heraclius as "magister militum per Orientem" succeeding the disgraced Priscus, and campaigned against the Persians in Armenia. In 614, as a Persian army under Shahin invaded Asia Minor and reached the shores of the Bosporus at Chalcedon, Philippicus invaded Persian territory in turn, hoping to cause Shahin to withdraw.
Philippicus died shortly after, and was buried in a church he had built at Chrysopolis.
Possible authorship of the "Strategikon".
As one of the leading generals of his day, and with both the time and opportunity to write it sometime after 603, during the years he spent in a monastery, Philippicus is one of the possible authors of the military treatise known as the "Strategikon" and traditionally attributed to Maurice.

LAK-9

__NOTOC__
The LAK-9 "Lietuva" () was an open-class competition sailplane produced in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. It was based on the LAK BK-7 that had been produced in small numbers since 1972. Like it, the LAK-9 was a conventional sailplane design with a high-set cantilever wing and a conventional empennage. The landing gear consisted of a retractable monowheel and a tailwheel, and construction throughout was of fibreglass. 
The type came to the attention of the West when a LAK-9 was flown in the 1976 Gliding World Championships in Finland, the first entry by the Soviet Union since 1968. Piloted by O. Pasetnik, it was withdrawn from competition due to aileron damage.
The fourth batch to be produced was designated the LAK-9M (for "Modernised"), and a motorglider version was also produced.

Diana al-Hadid

Diana Al-Hadid is a contemporary artist. She was born, and lived in Aleppo, Syria, in 1981 and lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She received a BA in Art History and a BFA in sculpture from Kent State University in Ohio (2003), an MFA sculpture from Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond (2005), and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine (2007).
Biography.
Al-Hadid was born in Aleppo, Syria in 1981 and lived there with her family until she was five. They then emigrated to Canton, Ohio, where Al-Hadid grew up. After finishing her graduate education, she moved to New York. As of 2013, she lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.
Work.
The work of Diana Al-Hadid is, in many ways, about architecture. Her sculptures often recall built structures—cathedrals, pipe organs, towers, labyrinths, cities—yet are made of simple, often delicate or fragile materials, such as polymer gypsum, plaster, fiberglass, wood, polystyrene, cardboard, wax, and paint, commonly found in art and industrial supply shops. Notes Nasher Sculpture Center Director Jeremy Strick: “Diana Al-Hadid creates breathtaking sculptures that surprise us by their unusual forms, unconventional use of materials, and distinctive range of reference and allusion. Her innovative work opens up new ground for the form and meaning of sculpture.”
in addition to architecture, Al-Hadid draws a great deal of inspiration from painting. She admires Northern Renaissance paintings, and the way paintings allow artists to invent space and floating objects.
Her sculptures are often very large, often ten feet or bigger. She carefully builds them in parts that can be assembled and disassembled as needed. Al-Hadid finds enjoyment in this process, stating, “That’s what occupies my mind: How do I build 
it? How do I get it in? I find that stuff fun."
The sculptures have the appearance of unfinished buildings or archeological remains, and it is often difficult to discern if they are in the process of construction or collapse. Ranging in scale from the human to the architectural, her work references a diverse set of interests, including Arab and Greek mythology, Gothic and Middle Eastern architecture, cosmology and physics.
Despite their personal and intellectual origins, it is their physical presence and ephemeral materiality that make the sculptures powerful, universally understandable evocations of the human condition. Al-Hadid’s ruminations on architectural ruins have recently expanded with the increasing presence of the figure. The fragmented, melting or draped Hellenistic-like figures meld and blur in to the construction and in some instances become incised by the structure. In 2010 she also began working in bronze. 
An equally accomplished part of Al-Hadid’s practice is her works on paper. These are not preparatory drawings to her sculptures; rather they are finished meticulously layered, conflated and erased conglomerates of pigment, conté and charcoal. Frequently architecture and, even figures, may reveal themselves behind the veil of the artist’s feverish strokes.

Pivot theorem

In geometry, the pivot theorem states that, given any three points P, Q, and R on each corresponding side of a triangle ABC, the three circles through the points AQR, BPR and CPQ share a common point M. Conversely, this is equivalent to a porism: given any three circles sharing a common point M, there are an infinite number of triangles such that one point lies on each circle and the sides of the triangle pass through the intersection points of the circles.
There is also a three-dimensional analog, in which the four spheres passing through a point of a tetrahedron and points on the edges of the tetrahedron intersect in a common point.

Aquilegia eximia

Aquilegia eximia is a species of columbine known by the common name Van Houtte's columbine. It is endemic to California, where it grows in the moist forests of the Coast Ranges. This is a perennial herb growing from a thick caudex and varying in height, reaching a maximum height near 1.5 meters. The lower leaves are divided into large, leaflike segments up to 4 or 5 centimeters long and a lobed oval in shape. Leaves farther up the stem are not segmented but may be deeply lobed. The inflorescence bears a large, nodding columbine flower. Each flower has five bright red to orange-red flat sepals up to nearly 3 centimeters long, and five petals which are hollow spurs up to 4 centimeters long, bright orange-red on the outer surface and lighter orange to yellow inside. The mouth of each hollow petal tube is up to a centimeter wide. The sepals and petals are generally reflexed back toward the stem and the five pistils and many thin stamens extend forward from the center of the flower.

Divorce Me, Darling!

Divorce Me, Darling is a musical written by Sandy Wilson. Set ten years after the events depicted in Wilson's much better known "The Boy Friend", it is a pastiche of 1930s musicals (in particular those of Cole Porter) rather than the "Roaring Twenties" shows (mostly early Rodgers and Hart) that inspired the earlier show.
Productions.
"Divorce Me, Darling!" was first presented at The Players' Theatre on December 9, 1964.This is where Sandy Wilson's 'The Boy Friend' first appeared.
On 1 February 1965 it transferred to the West End and ran for 91 performances at London's Globe Theatre. It had its U.S. premiere at the Arena Theatre, Theatre Under the Stars, Houston, Texas, in 1984. It played at the Chichester Festival Theatre in July 1997, featuring Ruthie Henshall as Polly 
It is still occasionally revived at both an amateur and professional level, sometimes as a double bill with "The Boy Friend".

The action takes place over two days in the summer of 1936 on the French Riviera. The characters are older versions of the same characters introduced in "The Boy Friend".
Act I.
In Nice on the French Riviera in the foyer of the Hotel du Paradis greeted by the hotel manager Gaston singing "Here We Are In Nice Again" with an assortment of hotel guests. The three naughty wives (Dulcie, Fay and Nancy) confess to Hortense, the hotel receptionist, they are on a spree having told their French husbands they were off to England to visit their families there. Polly, our heroine, arrives but without her husband, Sir Tony, busy at home handling their estate. The three naughty wives reappear with giddy greetings all around. Reflecting on their dreary mates who seem more concerned with matters of business than with matters of the heart, they croon "Whatever Happened To Love?" Hortense, hotel receptionist/confidante consoles the frustrated wives and cheers them up with the news that tomorrow night an international star, the mysterious Madame K, will appear in un Grand Cabaret. The American, Bobby van Husen, a bit tipsy, enters from the bar and sings "Someone to Dance With" offering to waltz, fox-trot, tango, or rumba if only he could find a partner. Hardly recognizing one another, Bobby and Polly meet and ask about each other's mate. He reports on his wife Maisie who is supposedly in London trying to round up a husband for his older sister Hannah. Bobby and Polly plan to have dinner together. Meanwhile, Mme Dubonnet confides in Hortense that she is the mysterious entertainer Madame K; she also admits she is Polly's stepmother, married to Percy who fled to South America after losing his fortune in the stock market crash of 1929. With the loss of their fortune and his escape to the New World, she was forced to pursue a lowly career in cabaret. She wants to keep the awful truth from Polly; she's changed her hair to blond and her name to Mme K (that ought to do it!) and expresses her hard, heart-breaking life behind the "glittering facade" of her theatrical calling in her number, "Lights! Music!"
Cheering off stage heralds the arrival of the President of the South American nation of Monomania. Pierre, Marcel and Alphonse, the errant husbands of Nancy, Fay and Dulcie show up in Nice feeling like bachelors again and sing of a special girl "Maisie" they remember from their carefree single days. Lady Brockhurst (Polly's mother-in-law) arrives on the scene with a trio of young girls dressed in hiking gear. Their anthem is "Back To Nature," urging one and all to forget the city and explore the rugged life of the great outdoors. She brings her troops to a halt, and, of course, Lord Brockhurst, dressed in plus fours is a reluctant member of her troop—far more interested in pinching rather than bringing up the rear. The troop march off in search of a spot to pitch camp, and true to form, Lord Brockhurst sneaks off in the opposite direction in pursuit of a skirt. He runs into Dulcie, Fay and Nancy, and they agree not to snitch on each other—all having deserted their mates for a bit of frolicking. They sing "On The Loose." The President of Monomania and Percy, in a tropical suit and dark glasses, greet one another as compatriots. Since they are of the same stature and with the addition of a false beard and wearing the President's uniform, Percy agrees to go in the President's place to the gala at the Cafe Pataplon. The President must be elsewhere for a reason he cannot reveal. Percy agrees to take on the role. Then he spots Madame K featured on a poster. He gasps recognizing Kiki, his wife (Mme Dubonnet) but with blond hair.
Scene 3 reveals two balconies side by side. Hortense and Gaston (both of the hotel staff) are inspecting each of the suites and simultaneously come out on the balconies to get a glimpse of the Riviera view. Ever dedicated to their chosen professions, their duet describes their dream resort, "Paradise Hotel" as other members of the staff join in the song. They exit before Polly enters one suite, kissing the photo of her husband Sir Tony; Bobby in the other suite follows suit, kissing the photo of his Maisie. Polly's on her balcony. He's on his. What a coincidence. He invites her, just as old friends, of course, to his balcony for champagne. They drink to absent mates and sing "No Harm Done." They dance a bit. She protests at bit saying they must say goodnight before anything silly happens. They dance a bit more from his suite to hers. He accidentally drops a scarf he's wearing in her quarters. The telephone rings. It's her husband, Tony. . Bobby gets a call on his telephone. It's Maisie. In the adjoining suite Sir Tony spots the scarf. He argues with Polly as to what it's doing there. Angrily he exits-to take a bath. She rushes to the balcony to tell Bobby about his scarf. His news is that Maisie's on her way up. He welcomes Maisie to the suite and pours champagne. The glass has lipstick on it. She accuses him of having a secret lover—so that's why he came to Nice! In tears she rushes out of the room. He calls for Polly from the balcony and lets her know he has made Maisie as jealous as she has made her Tony. Isn't it delicious? Soon, from inside each suite, we can hear their mates apologize for their suspicious behavior. Polly and Bobby signal one another that they've each won this round.
The next morning each couple in turn in pajamas and negligees on their respective balconies have breakfast and sing "Together Again." As the number ends the two couples spot each other. What a coincidence! Bobby puts on an act of surprise, as does Polly. Suddenly Hannah, Bobby's older husband-hunting sister, bursts in looking for her brother. Sir Tony’s mum, Lady Brockhurst, still in her camping togs, looking for her son and complaining about the hotel management follows the intrusion. She seems to have set up her tent in the hotel gardens. Arguments ensue. Hannah introduces herself to Sir Freddy once she discovers he's a baronet. From the suite above, Madame K (Mme Dubonnet) complains about all the noise below. Enter valets, chambermaids, manicurists, and chefs, all squeezing into the tiny room.
Hortense and the hotel staff join in for a reprise of "Paradise Hotel" (reprise) as pandemonium ends the act.
Act II.
Outside the Cafe Pataplon, Hannah mentions the scarf as well as the lipstick stain on the glass and provokes another argument between each couple (Tony vs. Polly as well as Bobby vs. Maisie). They sing to their mates "Divorce Me, Darling." Others arrive at the cabaret discovering their mate’s flirting. Husbands and wives are shocked at each other’s capricious behaviors, accusing one another and picking up loose ends of the song.
The President (actually Percy in a false beard, the president's military uniform, and dark glasses) is ceremoniously announced as the Monomania "Anthem" is struck up by the band. Percy, upon seeing his daughter Polly, does a double take and enters the ballroom.
Hannah laments her unattached state with "Here I Am, But Where's My Guy?". The sibilant challenged Sir Freddy arrives. She nabs him and sweeps him into the ballroom.
Mme Dubonnet (Madame K) confides in Hortense explaining she cannot do her nightclub act for it would reveal to Polly that her stepmother is a lowly cabaret performer. She convinces Hortense to don a mask and go on in her place. They rehearse a brief reprise of "Lights! Music!" (reprise).
Bobby and Maisie are still at odds. She's still determined to divorce him. He sings "Out Of Step" and urges her to dance. She joins him reluctantly. The manager of the Cafe Pataplon introduces the act, and Hortense, wearing a mask, goes on as Madame K singing "Fancy Forgetting" (reprise). Percy (disguised as the President) leaps up to expose the impostor, tears off Hortense's mask and Mme Dubonnet steps in singing a line from the song. Percy is overwhelmed. She, in turn, exposes him. He's not the President of Monomania! He admits it tearing off the beard. Polly cries out "Daddy!" Lady Brockhurst and her uniformed girls march in and perform a military drill. A champagne bottle literally explodes! Someone has placed a bomb in the jeriboam to kill the President of Monomania. The real President enters and commends Percy for his bravery in impersonating him and putting himself on the line. The President invites all to continue the party aboard his yacht. Percy, Mme Dubonnet, and Polly are reunited ("Together Again" (reprise)).
The proper British Sir Freddy and the all-American Hannah get reunited too ("You're Absolutely Me").
Act III.
On board the President's yacht Polly and Tony are reunited, each apologizing for playing games and acting foolish. They are in each other's arms ("Back Where We Started"). Polly and Bobby run into each other on deck and she assures him everything is patched up between her and Tony. Maisie is approaching them as the yacht lurches and Polly stumbles into Bobby's arms. Maisie, in tears, runs off. Entertaining the President and his guests, Mme Dubonnet sings (a la Marlene Dietrich) "Blondes For Danger", warning sailors to beware of this breed ("You can make a household pet/Of a redhead or brunette... " but cautions them about the dangerous blonde). Commending Percy for his heroism, the President awards him a deed to the Monomanian Platinum Mine. Percy and Mme Dubonnet embrace.
Hannah has Sir Freddy in tow; they're to be married. Bobby is searching for Maisie. Lady Brockhurst is shocked to see her girls have traded their scouting uniforms for scanty shorts, sailor caps and tap shoes as they break into song with a trio of sailors: "Swing Time Is Here To Stay". Maisie, in an abbreviated seafaring uniform, leads the cast in the song and dance. Bobby patches things up with Maisie, supported by Polly and Tony. Suddenly Polly faints. In turn Maisie and the other girls faint as well. Their husbands come to their rescue—all delighted to discover they're all in the family way ("Divorce Me, Darling" (reprise)). "I would like to make it plain/You'll never hear me say again/Divorce me, darling!"

Miquel's theorem

Miquel's theorem is a result in geometry, named after Auguste Miquel, concerning the intersection of three circles, each drawn through one vertex of a triangle and two points on its adjacent sides. 
Formally, let "ABC" be a triangle, with points "A´", "B´" and "C´" on sides "BC", "AC", and "AB" respectively. Draw three circumcircles to triangles "AB´C´", "A´BC´", and "A´B´C". Miquel's theorem then states that these circles intersect in a single point "M", the Miquel point. In addition, the three angles "MA´B", "MB´C" and "MC´A" (green in the diagram) are all equal, as are the three complementary angles "MA´C", "MB´A" and "MC´B".
The theorem (and its corollary) follow from the properties of two cyclic quadrilaterals drawn from any two of a triangle's vertices, having an edge in common as shown in the figure. Their combined angles at "M" (opposite "A" and opposite "C") will be (180 - "A") + (180 - "C"), giving an exterior angle equal to ("A" + "C"). Since ("A" + "C") also equals (180 - "B"), the intersection at "M", lying on the chord "A´C´", must also lie on a cyclic quadrilateral passing through points "B", "A´", and "C´". This completes the proof. 
If the fractional distances of "A´", "B´" and "C´" along sides "BC" ("a"), "CA" ("b") and "AB" ("c") are "d""a", "d""b" and "d""c", respectively, the Miquel point, in trilinear coordinates ("x" : "y" : "z"), is given by:
where "d"'"a" = 1 - "d""a", "etc."
In the case "d""a" = "d""b" = "d""c" = ½ the Miquel point is the circumcentre .
The theorem can be reversed to say: for three circles intersecting at "M", a line can be drawn from any point "A" on one circle, through its intersection "C´" with another to give "B" (at the second intersection). "B" is then similarly connected, via intersection at "A´" of the second and third circles, giving point "C". Points "C", "A" and the remaining point of intersection, "B´", will then be collinear, and triangle "ABC" will always pass though the circle intersections "A´", "B´" and "C´".
This can be extended to a circle with four points. Given points, "A", "B", "C", and "D" on a circle, and circles passing through each adjacent pair of points, the alternate intersections of these four circles at "W", "X", "Y" and "Z" then lie on a common circle. This is known as Miquel's six circles theorem.

Field Hygiene and Sanitation

Field hygiene and sanitation are two facets of military medicine that seek to ensure reduction of casualty through avoidance of non-combat related health issues among military personnel, particularly in the prevention of disease. As such it encompasses prevention of communicable diseases, promotes personal hygiene, ensures adequate field water supply, supervises food sanitation, administers waste disposal, controls, prevents and combats insect-borne diseases: mosquito, louse, fly, fleas, ticks, and mites, and other insects. Field hygiene control also includes knowledge and avoidance of venomous animals and their control, rodent-borne diseases and their control, control of leeches, and other miscellaneous diseases, or health problems related to extreme temperature environments. Lack of field hygiene and sanitation were major contributors to non-combat related casualty and death in pre-modern field armies, and continued to remain as serious threats to soldier health in modern warfare during the First World War, on the Eastern Front during the Second World War, in the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Field hygiene and sanitation are also major medical problems and causes of death among the World refugee populations.

David Willis (journalist)

David Willis (born London, 1960) is a British journalist.
Education.
Willis was educated at St Joseph's College, an independent school in the county town of Ipswich in Suffolk, followed by "Harlow Technical College", since renamed Harlow College, in the new town of Harlow in Essex.
Career.
Willis entered journalism after college as a cub reporter on the "Hertfordshire Mercury" newspaper and joined the BBC in 1983. After spells in local radio and regional television, he moved to London to assume the role of Political Correspondent, based at the Houses of Parliament. His career as a foreign correspondent began in 1994, after he was appointed the BBC’s Asia Correspondent. During six years based in Singapore, he covered the Hong Kong handover, the funeral of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, and obtained exclusive pictures of the Cambodian dictator Pol Pot’s “trial” by fellow Khmer Rouge cadres. He also reported first-hand on the downfall of Indonesia’s president Suharto, as well as the subsequent bloodbath in East Timor– during which he was briefly jailed by the Indonesian authorities - and broke a series of exclusive reports relating to the downfall of Singapore-based, "rogue trader" Nick Leeson. 
Appointed the BBC’s California correspondent in January 2000, Willis has since covered a string of top stories in north, south and Central America. He traveled the length and breadth of the country after 9/11, gauging reaction to the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, chronicled the economic collapse in Argentina–during which he and his crew were tear-gassed on the streets of Buenos Aires–and spent the 2002 football World Cup reporting from Rio De Janeiro on the progress of the ultimately triumphant Brazilian national team. He unearthed exclusive and disturbing evidence of child soldiers serving on the front line in Colombia’s drugs war, and covered the 2002 election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil. For the last ten years he has also covered the Academy Awards.
Willis has also served as a war correspondent. He was “embedded” with U.S. forces during the 2003 military invasion of Iraq, and filed vivid dispatches from the front line, as American marines battled their way to Baghdad. He survived an ambush by members of the Republican Guard, and attacks on the marine unit to which he was assigned. His reports also featured prominently on National Public Radio (NPR) and ABC News, and in a BBC book, "The Battle for Iraq". Since the invasion, he has undertaken a string of difficult and dangerous follow-up assignments in Iraq. 
In 2003 Willis was invited to take up a place on the Reuters Fellowship, which every year provides study scholarships to senior journalists from around the world. During the three-month sabbatical as a visiting scholar at Oxford University, he conducted research on the relationship between the Bush administration and the media. Some of his current projects include covering breakthroughs in the fight against Alzheimer’s, health problems occurring as a result of oil drilling in Colorado, and other longer-form news features. He has also served as a regular guest presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme 'Americana.'
Willis lives in Silver Lake, California, and is currently working on a book, a humorous account of his journey at attempting stardom, and a tongue-in-cheek look at how easy—or difficult—it is to break into Hollywood. He drew inspiration from his six-month sabbatical from the BBC in 2006, during which he tried to become a successful thespian. In an article he said, “Although I won't be giving up the day job any time soon, as far as acting is concerned I've caught the bug, and it's much too early to take the final bow.”

Clifford's circle theorems

In geometry, Clifford's theorems, named after the English geometer William Kingdon Clifford, are a sequence of theorems relating to intersections of circles.
The first theorem considers any four circles passing through a common point "M" and otherwise in general position, meaning that there are six additional points where exactly two of the circles cross and that no three of these crossing points are collinear. Every set of three out of these four circles has among them three crossing points, and (by the assumption of non-collinearity) there exists a circle passing through these three crossing points. Like the first set of four circles, the second set of four circles defined in this way all pass through a single point "P".
The second theorem considers five circles in general position passing through a single point "M". Each subset of four circles defines a new point "P" according to the first theorem. Then these five points all lie on a single circle "C".
The third theorem consider six circles in general position that pass through a single point "M". Each subset of five circles defines a new circle by the second theorem. Then these six new circles "C" all pass through a single point.
The sequence of theorems can be continued indefinitely.

Ted Pheasant

Edward "Ted" Pheasant (15 February 1877 – 17 July 1910) was an English footballer, who played in the Football League for both Black Country clubs, Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion.
Career.
Pheasant began his career at local non-league club Wednesbury Excelsior (which later became Wednesbury Old Athletic) before joining First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 1895. He made his league debut on 19 September 1896 in a 3–4 loss at Derby, but had to wait until the 1898–99 season to become a first choice player.
He was an ever-present for two successive seasons during 1899–1901, amassing 168 games for the club over a nine-year stay. He then moved to neighbours West Bromwich Albion in November 1904 for a £500 transfer fee and in the same month made his debut against Manchester United in a Division Two match. He appeared in 152 games for Albion in all competitions, scoring 22 goals.
The defender joined Leicester Fosse in 1910 but never played a game for them. He died of peritonitis just two weeks after signing for the club, on 17 July 1910 aged 33. (An obituary in the West Bromwich & Oldbury Chronicle, dated Friday 22 July 1910, suggests that Ted Pheasant had recently signed for Darlaston after being released by WBA.

PATH (variable)

PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. In general, each executing process or user session has its own PATH setting.
Unix and Unix-like.
On POSIX and Unix-like operating systems, the codice_1 variable is specified as a list of one or more directory names separated by colon (codice_2) characters.
The codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 directories are typically included in most users' codice_1 setting (although this varies from implementation to implementation). The current directory (codice_7) is sometimes included as well, allowing programs residing in the current working directory to be executed directly. Superuser (root) accounts as a rule do "not" include it in codice_1, however, in order to prevent the accidental execution of scripts residing in the current directory. Executing such a program requires the deliberate use of a directory prefix (codice_9) on the command name.
When a command name is specified by the user or an exec call is made from a program, the system searches through codice_1, examining each directory from left to right in the list, looking for a filename that matches the command name. Once found, the program is executed as a child process of the command shell or program that issued the command.
DOS, OS/2, and Windows.
On DOS, OS/2, and Windows operating systems, the codice_11 variable is specified as a list of one or more directory names separated by semicolon (codice_12) characters.
The Windows system directory (typically codice_13) is typically the first directory in the path, followed by many (but not all) of the directories for installed software packages. Many programs do not appear in the path as they are not designed to be executed from a command window, but rather from a Graphical User Interface. Some programs may add their directory to the front of the PATH variable's content during installation, to speed up the search process and/or override OS commands. In the DOS era, it was customary to add a codice_14 or codice_15 line to AUTOEXEC.BAT.
When a command is entered in a command shell or a system call is made by a program to execute a program, the system first searches the current working directory and then searches the path, examining each directory from left to right, looking for an executable filename that matches the command name given. Executable programs have filename extensions of codice_16 or codice_17, and batch scripts have extensions of codice_18 or codice_19. Other executable filename extensions can be registered with the system as well.
Once a matching executable file is found, the system spawns a new process in which to run it.
The PATH variable makes it easy to run commonly used programs located in their own folders. If used unwisely, however, the value of the PATH variable can slow down the operating system by searching too many locations, or invalid locations.

Alcelaphine herpesvirus 2

Alcelaphine herpesvirus 2 is a type of rhadinovirus that is believed to be responsible for causing hartebeest infections of malignant catarrhal fever.
Clinical Definition.
Distantly related to human herpes, a virus of this type is composed of a series of double strand sequences of up to 100 gene segments, aligned along a long chromosome surrounded by terminal DNA segments. The effect of the virus is to cause nasal discharge, a high fever, filmed over eyes, failures of the lymphatic system, inflammation of various mucus membranes, and occasionally necrosis of the upper digestive system. Very advanced cases show signs of decay of the nervous system. Occasionally, lesions, arthritis, and digestive problems such as diarrhea have been observed.
Etiology.
The agent of MCF in hartebeests, it is related to other variants that strike down antelopes. It was isolated in 1960 and is believed to be carried as reservoirs by goats, sheep, and other domestic animals. There are variants that have affected deer, gnu, and other captive species in zoos around the world.
Range.
All species of African wildebeest and hartbeest can be infected or at least carry this virus.
Transmission, clinical effects, and morbidity.
Alcelaphine herpesvirus 2 is primarily transmitted by nasal emissions, by contact with water, flood, feces, or close contact. It can be destroyed by prolonged exposure to sunlight, but has a very long incubation period and thus may have a long period of time to infect other animals. There are three forms usually seen. The first a nasal form with fever, nasal inflammation and digestive problems that is very mild and only lasts a few days. The second is a more severe form that involves fever, diarrhea, heavy nasal discharge, and lymph system failure, with a morbidity of 28 percent. The so-called "head and eye" form is the most lethal and serious form, which results in all known effects and central nervous system damage, predated by nervous shakes and eventually muscular failure. Morbidity in some cases is as high as 90 percent.
Vaccination.
As the primary infected strains of animals are wild and free range animals, vaccination programs have been largely ineffective.

Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Scarsdale

Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Scarsdale (1726 – 5 December 1804) was an English Tory politician and peer.
Curzon was the son of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet of Kedleston, and his wife Mary Assheton, daughter of Sir Ralph Assheton, Bt of Middleton Lancashire.
Curzon was elected as Member of Parliament for Clitheroe in 1747 which he held until 1754 when he was elected for his father's former constituency Derbyshire. In 1761 he was created Lord Scarsale and later served as Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords.
Curzon started work on the development of Kedleston Hall before he inherited. He employed the landscape gardener William Emes to replace the formal water features with natural lakes. In 1759 he commissioned the rebuilding of the house, designed in Palladian style by the architects James Paine and Matthew Brettingham. Robert Adam was designing some garden temples to enhance the landscape of the park. Curzon was so impressed with Adam's designs, that Adam was quickly put in charge of the construction of the new mansion
Curzon married, in 1751, Lady Carolina Colyear, daughter of Charles, Earl of Portmore. His eldest son Nathaniel succeeded to the title and became Lord Scarsdale.
Kedleston Hall.
The Hall is located 4 miles north-west of Derby, and is now open to the public, as one of the properties owned by the National Trust. One wing of Kedleston is still occupied by the Curzon family.
Curzon intended Kedleston Hall to outshine the house of his Whig neighbour the Cavendishes at Chatsworth. He employed several architects and in December 1758 he met Robert Adam, who he would employ in his reconstruction of Kedleston. Curzon's cabinet-maker of choice was John Linnell. Linnell created the arguably the most magnificent sofas of the Georgian era for the Drawing Room at Kedleston. These are sofas have sea nymphs, mermen and mermaids whose tails entwine as their armrests.

Peder Furubotn

Peder Furubotn (29 August 1890 – 28 November 1975) was a Norwegian cabinetmaker, politician for the Communist Party and resistance member during World War II.
Early and personal life.
Furubotn was born in Brekke, Sogn og Fjordane, the son of Jørgen Furubotn and Valgjerd Miljeteig. He married Gina Dorthea Sandal in 1912. He started working as a cabinetmaker in Bergen when he was 14 years old. He joined the local union in 1909, and was a board member of the Bergen chapter for several years. He was also a board member of the Labour Party in Bergen. He was a board member of the radical union branch "Fagopposisjonen av 1911", which had been founded by Martin Tranmæl.
1923–1940.
He was elected secretary for the Communist Party of Norway ("Norges Kommunistiske Parti", "NKP") from its foundation in 1923, and was chairman of the party from 1925 to 1930. During this period he was among the loyal Moscow supporters and criticized people who diverged from the "correct" political line, as well as the Labour Party. Furubotn stayed in Moscow from 1930 to 1938, when he returned to Norway.
World War II.
Furubotn was arrested in August 1940, but released after interrogation. He immediately went undercover. He was elected secretary general of the NKP in 1941, after the arrest of de facto leader Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen following the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941.
He managed an undercover resistance organization in Norway during the five years of German occupation. From a centralized camp he activated resistance groups in different parts of the country. The camp developed sectors for economy, transport, distribution, newspapers, sabotage, intelligence and courier traffic, and organized farmers, women and youth. The camp was typically located in isolated mountain dairy farms, and could have a security zone with a 10-kilometre radius. External visits to the headquarters were only allowed during relocation periods. Frequent conferences were normally held at mountain huts or farms within a wider zone. Security personnel were located in the surrounding rural districts, and the camp received intelligence reports from observations of the Gestapo headquarters in Oslo and other cities.
The Germans made several efforts at catching Furubotn and his communist resistance organization. During the German Operation Almenrausch in June 1944 he successfully made a close escape from a large number of German troops, together with his family and central political activists, including Ørnulf Egge, Roald Halvorsen, Samuel Titlestad and Arne Taraldsen. But several other members of the organization were arrested in the operation.
Titlestad was chief of security for Furubotn, and he has been credited for developing security arrangements including the hiding out in huts in Øystre Slidre.
Post-war period.
Furubotn had a central role within the Communist Party until 1947, when he retired from his position as secretary general. In 1949 he was expelled from the NKP following internal controversies and interference from Moscow. Furubotn and his supporters were accused of being titoists and nationalists. Furubotn continued with political activities, but was isolated from party politics during the Cold War period. Among his post-war publications are ' from 1948, ' from 1951, ' from 1963, ' and "" from 1969. His biography was written by historian Torgrim Titlestad. Furubotn died in Oslo in 1975.

Fisher worked as the percussionist on the title theme for the HBO series "Six Feet Under", for which composer Thomas Newman was awarded the 2001-2002 Emmy for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music.
Fisher has worked on hundreds of movies, soundtracks and CDs. Wall-E, Memoirs of a Geisha and the much anticipated movie "Avatar." 
During the making of the movie, "", Iva Davies denotes Fisher's collection of percussion as probably the largest in the world. Iva said of his work with Fisher:
"Early in the process I was introduced to Mike Fisher. He is a wonderful percussionist and an enthusiastic musician. I went with him into the suburbs of L.A. where he keeps a warehouse which is literally full of drums and percussion. His collection is very possibly the most extensive in existence. From his vast collection I chose a number of Taiko drums and an assortment of other drums and percussion to be used.
The process of composing the drums for each piece involved using the samplers to create the multiple drum parts. These were then transcribed to sheet music. Mike would bring his collection of selected drums and percussion to the studio where I then oversaw the recordings of his performances of these parts. Although there are multiple layers of drums on almost all of the pieces, these were all played by Mike."

Raid on Alexandria (1941)

The Raid on Alexandria was carried out on 19 December 1941 by Italian Navy divers, members of the Decima Flottiglia MAS, who attacked and disabled two Royal Navy battleships in the harbour of Alexandria, Egypt, using manned torpedoes.
Background.
On 3 December, the submarine of the Italian Royal Navy ("Regia Marina") left the naval base of La Spezia carrying three manned torpedoes, called "maiali" (pigs) by the Italians. At the island of Leros in the Aegean Sea, the submarine secretly picked up six crewmen for them: Luigi Durand de la Penne and Emilio Bianchi ("maiale" nº 221), Vincenzo Martellotta and Mario Marino ("maiale" nº 222), and Antonio Marceglia and Spartaco Schergat ("maiale" nº 223).
Raid.
On 19 December, "Scirè"—at a depth of —released the manned torpedoes from Alexandria commercial harbour, and they entered the naval base when the British opened their defenses to let three of their destroyers pass. There were many difficulties for de la Penne and his crewmate Emilio Bianchi. First, the engine of the torpedo stopped and the two frogmen had to manually push it; then Bianchi had to surface due to problems with the oxygen provider, so that de la Penne had to push the "Maiale" alone to where lay. There he successfully placed the limpet mine, just under the hull of the battleship. However, as they both had to surface, and as Bianchi was hurt, they were discovered and captured.
Questioned, both of them kept silent, and they were confined in a compartment aboard "Valiant", under the sea level, and coincidentally just over the place where the mine had been placed. Fifteen minutes before the explosion, de la Penne asked to meet with "Valiant"s captain Charles Morgan and then told him of the imminent explosion but refused to give further information, so that he was returned to the compartment. Fortunately for the Italians, when the mine exploded just before them, neither he nor Bianchi were severely injured by the blast, while de la Penne only received a minor injury to the head by a ship chain.
Meanwhile, Marceglia and Schergat had attached their device five feet beneath the battleship 's keel as scheduled. They successfully left the harbour area at 4:30 am, and slipped through Alexandria posing as French sailors. They were captured two days later at Rosetta by the Egyptian police while awaiting rescue by the "Scirè" and handed over to the British. Martellota and Marino searched in vain for an aircraft carrier purportedly moored at Alexandria, but after sometime they decided to attack a large tanker, the 7554 gross register ton Norwegian "Sagona". Marino fixed the mine under the tanker's stern at 02:55. Both divers managed to land unmolested, but were eventually arrested at an Egyptian checkpoint.
In the end, all the divers were made prisoners, but not before their mines exploded, severely damaging both HMS "Queen Elizabeth" and "Valiant", disabling them for nine months and six months respectively.
The "Sagona" lost her stern section and the destroyer , one of four alongside her refuelling, was badly damaged. Although the two capital ships sank only in a few feet of water and were eventually raised, they were out of action for over one year.
Aftermath.
This represented a dramatic change of fortunes against the Allies from the strategic point of view during the next six months. The Italian fleet had temporarily wrested naval supremacy in the east-central Mediterranean from the Royal Navy.
"Valiant" was towed to Admiralty Floating Dock 5 on the 21st for temporary repairs and was under repair at Alexandria until April 1942 when she sailed to Durban. By August, she was operating with Force B off Africa in exercises for the defence of East Africa and operations against Madagascar. "Queen Elizabeth" was in drydock at Alexandria for temporary repairs until late June, when she sailed for the United States for refit and repairs, which ended the following June. The refit was completed in Britain. "Jervis" was repaired and operational again by the end of January.
In media.
The attack is dramatised at the beginning of the film "The Silent Enemy" (1958). Another movie "The Valiant" (1962), is about the sinking of HMS "Valiant" in Alexandria harbour. There is also a 1953 Italian movie ("I sette dell'Orsa Maggiore") about the attack, including some real members of Decima Flottiglia MAS as support actors in the cast.

<doc id="19335567" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19335567" title="MAVEN">
MAVEN

Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) is a space probe designed to study the Martian atmosphere while orbiting Mars. Mission goals include determining how the Martian atmosphere and water, presumed to have once been substantial, were lost over time.
MAVEN was successfully launched aboard an Atlas V launch vehicle at the beginning of the first launch window on November 18, 2013. Following the first engine burn of the Centaur second stage, the vehicle coasted in low-Earth orbit for 27 minutes before a second Centaur burn of five minutes to insert it into a heliocentric Mars transit orbit.
The plan is for MAVEN to be inserted into an areocentric elliptic orbit around Mars, by above the planet's surface, on September 22, 2014. The principal investigator for the spacecraft is Bruce Jakosky of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.
History.
The mission was spawned by NASA's Mars Scout Program, which, although discontinued in 2010, yielded Phoenix, MAVEN, and numerous missions' studies. Mars Scout missions target a cost of less than US$485 million, not including launch services, which cost approximately $187 million.
On September 15, 2008, NASA announced that it had selected MAVEN to be the Mars Scout 2013 mission. There was one other finalist and eight other proposals that were competing against MAVEN.
On August 2, 2013, the MAVEN spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space Center Florida to begin launch preparations. NASA scheduled the launch of MAVEN from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on November 18, 2013, using an Atlas V 401 rocket. The probe is expected to arrive in Mars' orbit in September 2014, at approximately the same time as India's Mars Orbiter Mission.
On October 1, 2013, only seven weeks before launch, a government shutdown caused suspension of work for two days and initially threatened to force a 26-month postponement of the mission. With the spacecraft nominally scheduled to launch on November 18, a delay beyond December 7 would have caused MAVEN to miss the launch window as Mars moves too far out of alignment with the Earth.
However, two days later, a public announcement was made that NASA had deemed the 2013 MAVEN launch so essential to ensuring future communication with current NASA assets on Mars—the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers—that emergency funding was authorized to restart spacecraft processing in preparation for an on-time launch.
Objectives.
Features on Mars that resemble dry riverbeds and the discovery of minerals that form in the presence of water indicate that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere and was warm enough for liquid water to flow on the surface. Scientists suspect that over millions of years, the planet’s core cooled and its magnetic field decayed, allowing the solar wind to sweep away ninety-nine percent of the atmosphere and thus most of its water and volatile compounds.
MAVEN is intended to determine the history of the loss of atmospheric gases to space so that answers about Martian climate evolution will emerge. From its measurements of how quickly the atmosphere escapes into space and the relevant processes, scientists will infer how the planet's atmosphere evolved. The MAVEN mission has four primary scientific objectives:
MAVEN is expected to reach Mars in September 2014. By then, the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite on board the Curiosity rover will have made similar surface measurements from Gale crater, which will help guide the interpretation of MAVEN's upper atmosphere measurements. MAVEN's measurements will also provide additional scientific context with which to test models for current methane formation in Mars.
Spacecraft overview.
MAVEN is built and tested by Lockheed Martin Space Systems and its design is based on those of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey spacecraft. The orbiter has a cubical shape of about high, with two solar arrays that hold the magnetometers on both ends. The total length is . NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory provided an Electra telecommunications relay package which has a data transfer rate of up to but the highly elliptical orbit of the spacecraft will limit its usefulness as a relay for operating landers on the surface.
Scientific instruments.
MAVEN will study Mars' upper atmosphere and its interactions with the solar wind. Its instruments will measure characteristics of Mars' atmospheric gases, upper atmosphere, and ionosphere, and the solar wind. MAVEN will perform measurements from a highly elliptical orbit over a period of one Earth year, with five "deep dips" at minimum altitude to sample the upper atmosphere. The University of Colorado Boulder, University of California, Berkeley, and Goddard Space Flight Center each built a suite of instruments for the spacecraft, and they include:

JMB Realty Corporation is a real estate investment company based in Chicago that at one time was one of the largest property developers in the United States. The company was founded as Robert Judelson & Co. in 1968. In 1969 Judelson (born 1939) was joined by University of Illinois roommates Neil Bluhm (born 1938) and Judd Malkin (born 1938).
Judelson split from the partnership in 1973 to form a real estate company Balcor Company with Jerry Reinsdorf. Bluhm became chairman and Malkin would be president. Judelson and Malkin were among the Reinsdorf consortium that bought the Chicago White Sox in 1981 and Chicago Bulls in 1984 
In 1983 JMB acquired the structures that housed Federated Department Stores. In 1984 it acquired Urban Development from Aetna for $1.4 billion 
In 1988 it acquired Amfac, a large Hawaii sugar cane land owner for $920 million and has since sold off much of the property as the Hawaii sugar cane industry has been dismantled. Among the assets was the department store Liberty House, which went into bankruptcy before being acquired by Federated. Amfac went into bankruptcy in 2002. One of the companies that emerged from the bankruptcy is Xanterra, a management company in United States National Parks. The Anschutz Company bought Xanterra from JMB in 2008.
Major acquisitions.

John Henry Cox

John Henry Cox (c. 1750-5 October 1791), charted Great Oyster Bay Maria Island and Marion Bay on the east coast of Tasmania in 1789, aboard his armed brig "Mercury".
Early years.
John Henry Cox was born c. 1750, the son of a rich jewellery merchant in London. His father James had a factory in Shoe Lane, which specialised in the manufacture of clocks and automatons (known as "sing-songs" in pidgin English), designed as bribes for Chinese mandarins who were in control of the native merchants with whom Europeans were obliged to deal in trade negotiations in Canton. He even published a work on his activity. When his father died towards the end of the 1770s, Cox turned to the East India Company for permission to stay in China for three years in order to sell the residue of his father's stock of clocks, and ostensibly "for his health’s sake". In May 1780 he was given permission to stay for two years and February 1781 saw him installed at Canton as a merchant, but privately and not under the control of the company.
When the two years had passed, he applied for a year’s extension, which was granted because of his "good bearing" and because he had been of special help to certain company chiefs. Cox then found it advantageous to move to Macao, where he was in association with a Scot, John Reid - who from 1779 had been Austrian consul and a naturalised Austrian subject - together with another Scotsman, Prussian consul Daniel Beale. All of their subterfuges were, of course, aimed at bypassing the East India Company’s restrictive regulations.
In 1784 Cox branched out and sent a ship up to the northwest coast of America with a cargo of iron, knives, nails etc. which he could use as barter for furs and skins. He operated on the West coast of Vancouver Island, especially Nootka Sound. Business went so well, that Cox and his associates founded the Bengal Fur Society in Calcutta and continued their activity into the following years. This led to Lord Cornwallis, Bengal's general governor, in 1787 complaining to the East India Company about their conduct, all to no avail. By this time, the Americans had joined in the fray; evidence of their activity remains in the "Columbia" and "Washington" medals, which Boston merchants struck to celebrate the sailing in September 1787 of these two US vessels for the northwest coast of America. The British Admiralty had in 1772 issued similar medals (struck by Matthew Boulton) featuring "Resolution" and "Adventure" celebrating James Cook's second voyage.
"Mercury".
Swedish endorsement.
Cox, at this stage, having already considerably overstayed his welcome, thought it wise to disappear to England for a spell but was soon back with newly hatched plans. This time, his idea was to see whether he could exploit the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. He paid a visit first to Gothenburg, where he made good use of the services of the Swedish East India Company's representatives there, William Chalmers, Lars Gotheen and J.A. Sandberg. Through these men he was able to make contact with Baron Erik Ruuth who was Gustav III's Swedish king Secretary of State for Commerce and Finance.
The king was apparently very enthusiastic about Cox's quite fantastic proposal which was in effect to put his brig "Mercury", newly purchased from the renowned Marmaduke Stalkartt, Deptford, at the disposal of Sweden and with her act as a privateer to raid both the eastern Russian coasts and their North American fur and skin establishments, for which Sweden would earn ten percent of the prizes. The last page of the king’s instructions is signed Gustaf by the king at Ghiöteborg (Gothenburg) 11 November 1788 and refers to his authorisation to Captain John Henry Cox of the Swedish naval brig "Gustaf den Tredie", ("Gustaf III"), "Mercury"'s cover-name.
England to Tasmania.
The Thames was still suffering under extreme weather conditions that winter, with the river frozen, and "Mercury" was not able to leave Gravesend on her prospective long voyage before 26 February 1789, but under English colours, as her destination was to be kept secret. Cox had provided himself with a chronometer made by William Hughes of Holborn and had it set to GMT in the mathematical school in Christ's Hospital, the headmaster of which was William Wales, who had sailed as astronomer in Captain Cook’s second voyage from 1772-5. Cox had originally intended taking the route via Cape Horn, but on account of the late departure decided to change this plan and take the route via the Cape of Good Hope. 
Lieut. George Mortimer of the Marines wrote an account of the voyage. Unfortunately he records almost no details of the ship’s crew but does mention the death of the ship's cook Thomas Smith on 8 October 1789. He also mentions that Cox had invited a number of his friends, making it sound almost like a rich man’s yacht cruise. On 25 March they sailed from Tenerife, crossed the Line in 20 degrees West and on 28 April they were passing Tristan da Cunha. Just about then, Captain William Bligh of HMS Bounty and the loyal members of the crew were being forced into the long boat by the mutineers led by Fletcher Christian. On 29 May "Mercury" reached their first objective, Amsterdam Island in the Roaring Forties, half way between Africa and Australia, discovered in 1522 by del Cano during his circumnavigation. Here they procured 1,000 seal skins and several barrels of oil. Mortimer believed that "Mercury" was probably the first English vessel to visit the island. He refers to Alexander Dalrymple’s "Account of the Discoveries Made in the S. Pacific Ocean", (London, 1767), which deals with the island, and states that the account by the Dutchman Willem de Vlamingh, first to land on the island, in 1696, though short, was tolerably accurate. On 8 July "Mercury" was anchoring in a bay on the east coast of Van Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, for wood and water, and Cox named it Oyster Bay, a name that still holds. He also charted Maria Island and Marion Bay there.
Crossing the Pacific.
They reached Tahiti on 13 August and anchored in Matavai Bay, where "Bounty" had lain for many months. Although some of the mutineers had remained, it was assumed that they lay hidden while "Mercury" was there. Mortimer communicated the intelligence to the Admiralty in respect of the probable destination of the Bounty mutineers, "as it is hoped will enable Captain Edwards of the "Pandora" frigate to bring them to that condign punishment they so justly merit". Captain Edwards' name appears on the list of subscribers to Mortimer’s book. 
"Mercury" stayed at Hawaii for only about two days between 23 and 25 September. On 27 October they were anchored in an inlet on Unalaska Island, one of the Fox Islands Group. They had come a month or two too late, and found that the natives had no furs to trade, but they did stay for about two weeks, which seemed long enough for the United States to name one of the Alaskan rivers Coxe, using the spelling of his name that he used when referring to his Swedish assignment. It seems in fact that Cox only took the brig there as a gesture of fulfilling the contract with the Swedish king. Apparently he had considered returning at a more suitable time, but the Russian-Swedish Treaty of Värälä signed on 14 August 1790 precluded any such plans. If Cox had gone prowling further afield round the North Pacific he might have found unexpected and surprising opposition; the Empress Catherine II had commissioned an expedition to carry out exploration work in the far east of Siberia and the Bering Sea. In charge of the Expedition was an Englishman in the Russian Naval Service, Commodore Joseph Billings, who was alerted regarding Cox's presence, but far too late, for by that time Cox was back in Macao, where he anchored on 27 December 1789, careful to advertise the appearance of the Swedish armed brig "Gustavus III" commanded by Captain John Henry Cox of the Swedish Royal Navy. He lost no time in writing a report to the Directors of the Swedish East India Co on 4 January 1790.
Northern Pacific.
Port Cox (since renamed Clayoquot Sound), a bay southeast of Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island, and Cox's Channel, a sound in the northernmost tip of the Queen Charlotte Islands between Langara Island and the northwestern tip of Graham Island and now named Parry Passage are named after Cox. According to the record in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), the nation's official geographic names repository of the US Board of Geographic Names, the mouth of the Coxe River, (note spelling) where it empties into Katlian Bay is at 57 degrees, 10 minutes, 24 seconds N latitude & 135 degrees, 16 minutes, 37 seconds W longitude. The source, or where the stream begins, is at 57 degrees, 11 minutes, 41 seconds N latitude & 135 degrees, 11 minutes, 58 seconds W longitude.
Cox appears to have intended to use the Swedish contract more as a talisman with which to confound the East India Company rather than wreak any damage on the Russians. Some evidence of this lies in the fact Mortimer's account has no mention of any gun drill, something that ought to have been a necessary part of the operation; only once does Mortimer mention even airing their powder.
Excessive speculation drove Reid into bankruptcy. He therefore closed the Austrian Consulate and left China. Cox's partnership however with Daniel Beale and his younger brother Thomas continued, at any rate under the combined name, during Cox's long period away from Canton. There were further successful voyages to northwest America, always under the Portuguese flag. However, in later years, competition from Spanish ships began to have effect. After his return to Canton, Cox was quickly in business again in Macao. 
It was at the end of September 1791 that Cox sailed "Mercury" up the river to Canton’s outer port Whampoa. The Honourable East India Company did not welcome him; on the contrary it threatened Cox in every way, refusing to allow him right of residence because it was considered that he, English citizen that he was, had broken the company's "sacred" monopoly. Nonetheless, Cox raised a Prussian flag and landed exuding disrespectful protests.
Death.
Cox did not live long enough to really enjoy the fortune he had amassed and died at quite a young age, on 5 October 1791 and was buried the following day on French Island that lay within sight of the ships moored at Whampoa, and was where all foreigners who died at Canton, or aboard the ships, were interred at the end of the 18th century.

Richard Costello

Captain Richard (Rich) Barry Costello (born April 4, 1951) is a 34 year Philadelphia police veteran and the former President of the Philadelphia Lodge of the FOP. He is currently challenging incumbent John Perzel in Pennsylvania's 172nd Legislative District in Northeast Philadelphia.
Early years.
Rich Costello was born in Northeast Philadelphia to an Irish-Catholic family. He attended Holy Ghost Preparatory School followed by St. Joseph's University. Costello earned his Bachelor's Degree in Political Science, graduating cum laude in May 1973.
Police service.
Following graduation Costello joined the Philadelphia Police Academy and graduated in September 1973.
Shot in the line of duty.
On the night of December 11, 1973 Costello dropped his partner off at 7:30 PM to guard the Faith Baptist Church in the Strawberry Mansion section of Philadelphia. Fifteen minutes later Costello was driving his patrol car east on Cumberland St past the intersection of 32nd St when, without warning, a gunman opened fire from the sidewalk. Costello was struck twice in the head with one bullet remaining permanently lodged behind his right ear.
Costello survived and spent two years recovering from his wounds but was able to successfully rejoin the force.
Both the diligent police response and public outcry kept Costello's case in the headlines. Despite a $10,000 reward from the FOP and a $5,000 reward from the Philadelphia Daily News no one came forward with information and the case remains unsolved.
Rise in the FOP.
In 1978 Costello joined the FOP as Unit Director after perceiving wrongdoing in the Union's health care benefits sector. After rising to Assistant Administrator of First Dental & Prescription Plan in 1982, Costello uncovered the Kravitz Corruption Scandal.
Dr. Charles Kravitz was the director of American Health Programs (AHP) which was given contracts by the FOP. Kravitz had been bribing top FOP officials to continue contracting out business to his company. After the scandal was uncovered Kravitz was charged and sentenced to Federal prison.
Having established himself as a credible reformer, Costello was made Recording Secretary in 1984- a position he held until 1988. In October 1988 Bob Hurst stepped down as President and Costello was elected to his first term as FOP president which lasted until 1990. After this he served as Chairman of Law Enforcement Health Benefits until 1994, when he was elected to his second term as FOP president.
In 2002 after 8 more years as president of the FOP Costello decided not to seek re-election, citing his desire to allow a new generation to move up. He was succeeded by Robert Eddis in October 2002.
Richard Costello's loyalty to individual police officers was known, and admired, by members of the Philadelphia Police Department. Through arguing the position of the individual police officer and never compromising the values they stood for, Costello was able to serve the City of Philadelphia as President of the Fraternal Order of Police.
Abu-Jamal criticism.
During his tenure as FOP President Costello was an outspoken critic of Mumia Abu-Jamal and his supporters. Abu-Jamal was convicted of the 1981 murder of officer Daniel Faulkner. This has led Costello to be featured on radio programs such as Michael Smerconish's as well as televised debates. Known for his extemporaneous speech, during one televised debate he made use of a Bible passage to describe Abu-Jamal as "a liar, the father of lies, and a murderer from the beginning."
Maureen Faulkner, the wife of the fallen officer, described Costello as "a cop who took a bullet in the head and cowers in front of no one" in her book "Murdered By Mumia" (cowritten by Smerconish).
Entry into politics.
2008 primary.
In January 2008 Costello decided to challenge long-time Philadelphia Republican Boss, and former House Speaker, John M. Perzel. Costello cited Perzel's many corruption scandals and his refusal to address the problems the Northeast faces with drugs and gun crime as his primary motivation for running. Perzel is heavily backed by the NRA and has refused to enact regulations on guns consistent with the City's upsurge in violence.
Costello handily won the Democratic Primary against challenger Tim Kearney. Kearney had previously challenged Perzel in 2004 and 2006.

Langley Twin

__NOTOC__
The Langley 2-4, variously described as the Langley Monoplane or Langley Twin was a twin-engine utility aircraft built in the United States in 1940. Named in honour of Samuel Pierpont Langley, the aircraft was designed to make use of non-strategic materials in its construction and thereby avoid any shortages brought about by war. Its design was conventional enough - a low-wing cantilever monoplane with twin tails and tailwheel undercarriage. The manufacturing process, however, was unorthodox, and the aircraft's structures were built up from mahogany veneers bent over moulds and impregnated with vinyl and phenol resins to make them hold their shape. The use of metal for structural elements - even in fasteners - was thereby almost completely avoided. 
Two prototypes were constructed, one with 65 hp (49 kW) engines, and another with 90 hp (67 kW) engines. The second machine was purchased by the United States Navy and evaluated as the XNL-1, but the navy did not order the type. Once the United States entered the war, it transpired that the resins needed for construction were in far shorter supply than the metal that would have been needed to produce an aircraft by conventional means, and the project was abandoned. The XNL-1 was sold as war surplus, and following an accident in 1965, its wings, engine nacelles, and main undercarriage were mated to a Stinson 108 fuselage to create a one-of-a-kind homebuilt aircraft named the Pierce Arrow.

HM Prison Bullingdon

HMP Bullingdon is a Category B/C men's prison, located in the village of Arncott (near Bicester) in Oxfordshire, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. Bullingdon Prison is named after Bullingdon, the ancient hundred in Oxfordshire.
History.
Opened in 1994, Bullingdon was constructed as a ‘new gallery' design prison, with its four main houseblocks divided into three galleried units. A fifth houseblock was added in 1998 which is a two galleried unit, and a sixth added in 2008, another two galleried unit. The prison was highlighted as being dangerously overcrowded in 2002 by Colin Moses (chairman of the Prison Officers Association) in a speech to the TUC conference. A year later Bullingdon was embroiled in further controversy when Deputy Governor Terence McLaren was arrested for possession of cocaine and child pornography offences. A prisoner escaped from Bullingdon a month later. The prison was again highlighted as the most overcrowded in England in 2004. In 2006 Governor Phil Taylor was criticised after he banned the display of the England flag by warders for fear of upsetting foreign inmates.
The prison today.
Bullingdon Prison accepts Category B prisoners from the local courts on remand as well as general Category C prisoners. A range of Work, Education and Training courses are offered, some of which can lead to Open University qualifications. The chaplaincy has a full-time Church of England chaplain and Imam.
A successful reading group scheme has operated in Bullingdon Prison; authors Boris Johnson and Nicci French have visited the group to join in discussions.

List of Perfect Strangers characters

This article contains character information for the American television sitcom "Perfect Strangers".
Main characters.
Balki Bartokomous.
The character of Balki Bartokomous was portrayed by Bronson Pinchot. Balki is an immigrant from the fictional Mediterranean country of Mypos, who arrives at the front door of Larry Appleton's apartment one night, and ends up becoming his roommate. Balki's original occupation was a sheepherder when he lived in Mypos, but after arriving in Chicago, he got a job at Ritz Discount Store where Larry also worked, and Balki would later get a job at the Chicago Chronicle newspaper, first in the mail room and then later helming a comic strip based on his oft-seen stuffed sheep, Dmitri. In the pilot episode, Balki explains that he is Larry's cousin and is distantly related through a step-uncle of Larry's father on his mother side.
Larry allows Balki to stay at his apartment until he got a job, but by the end of the pilot, became his permanent roommate. Balki's trademarks during the series are his vests (his regular style), the Myposian custom known as "The Dance of Joy" (a cross between a Dosado and the Hokey Pokey that Balki and Larry perform in celebration of good fortune), and his mangling of well-known American phrases. His catchprase during the series is "Don't be ridiculous" which he often says after Larry asks him a certain question. Balki has a good sense of humor which, after telling a joke often says, "Where do I come with them?". Larry tries to teach Balki about American life, but it is often that Balki is the one who teaches Larry important life lessons. Initially, he develops a crush on Larry's platonic friend Susan Campbell, but later went on to date Mary Anne Spencer, a flight attendant who is roommates with fellow flight attendant Jennifer Lyons, who dates and later marries Larry. In season seven, after Larry and Jennifer marry and move into a large Victorian house, they discover they cannot afford rent and utilities without additional roommates, after which Balki and Mary Anne move in with them. He and Mary Anne had a fairly ambiguous relationship, but they eventually married by season seven and became parents in the series finale in season eight.
Larry Appleton.
The character of Larry Appleton was portrayed by Mark Linn-Baker. Larry Appleton was born in Madison, Wisconsin and is part of a very large family, of which he has eight other siblings. Larry, an aspiring photographer, gets his first taste of living alone when he moves to Chicago at age 24. However, this is soon quickly changed when Myposian immigrant Balki Bartokomous arrives at his apartment in the pilot episode, claiming to be his distant cousin. Although initially hesitant at having Balki stay with him because he was just getting used to living alone, Larry decides to let Balki stay until he got a job. Larry ends up taking Balki under his wing and tries to teach him about life in America. His catchphrase is "Oh, my Lord!", which he says often, mainly after something shocking happens. He also frequently says, "I have a plan!", much to the chagrin of the others involved. Whenever Balki makes a mistake, Larry often says, "Don't ever, ever, do that again!". And when trying to show Balki how to do something, he says, "Watch and Learn!".
Very often though, the neurotic Larry proves to be just as inept if not more so in this respect than Balki is. Frequently, it is Balki who ends up being the one who teaches Larry life lessons. Originally employed at Ritz Discount Store, Larry would eventually get a job at the Chicago Chronicle in season three. By season four, Larry joins the investigative reporting team of Marshall & Walpole (loosely based on the famed Washington Post duo of Woodward and Bernstein, who broke the story of the Watergate scandal), though he physically remains at his typewriter in the basement. His only serious relationship during the series was with Jennifer Lyons, a flight attendant who arrived at Ritz Discount Store and who Larry fell for at first sight. They would later marry by season six and become parents by season eight in the series finale.
Jennifer Lyons.
The character of Jennifer Lyons was portrayed by Melanie Wilson. The character was initially introduced as a recurring character in season two, and became a series regular by season four. Jennifer is Larry's love interest for the remainder of the series, and she is introduced in the season two episode "Hunks Like Us" along with her friend and roommate Mary Anne Spencer. Like Mary Anne, Jennifer had worked as an airline flight attendant. In the episode in which she is introduced, although Larry did not think that a woman like Jennifer would notice a guy like him, he had attempted to impress Jennifer by going to the gym she went to in order to try and impress her with his workout skills, which only landed both him and Balki in pain. They later admitted to Jennifer and Mary Anne that they did not think that they would be impressed with them the way they are and tried to bulk up with disastrous results. Both Larry and Jennifer started dating, and their relationship began to mature and grow as the series progressed. The two became engaged to be married in season six, got married in season seven, and announced they were about to become first-time parents by the end of the season. The series finale featured Larry, Balki, and Jennifer taking off in a hot-air balloon to try to induce Jennifer into labor after Mary Anne had already given birth to her and Balki's first child. Jennifer gave birth to a baby boy, which they named Tucker.
Mary Anne Spencer.
The character of Mary Anne Spencer was portrayed by Rebeca Arthur. The character was initially introduced as a recurring character in season two, and became a series regular by season five. Mary Anne is Balki's love interest for much of the series, and she is introduced in the season two episode "Hunks Like Us" along with her friend and roommate Jennifer Lyons. Like Jennifer, Mary Anne had worked as a flight attendant. She was written as being somewhat of the "dumb blonde" stereotype, and her funniest lines were statements that betrayed her comical ignorance. In season seven, after Larry and Jennifer buy a large Victorian house, they discover they cannot afford rent and utilities without additional roommates, which prompt Balki and Mary Anne to move in with them. In the last few episodes of season seven, Mary Anne and Balki break up and she moves out of the house. But they would resolve their differences and Balki and Mary Anne got married in a whirlwind ceremony in the seventh season finale. In the season eight premiere, the newlyweds returned from an extended honeymoon in Balki's home country of Mypos and Mary Anne was revealed to be well into a pregnancy as Jennifer was. In part one of the series finale, Balki and Mary Anne decide to go a fair, and Mary Anne suddenly goes into labor and has her baby in the driveway, a boy, who they named Robespierre.
Donald Twinkacetti.
The character of Donald Twinkacetti was portrayed by Ernie Sabella. The character was as a series regular in seasons one and two. Donald Twinkacetti is the owner of Ritz Discount Store, which Larry and Balki worked during the show's first and second seasons, and was the guys' landlord. He is depicted as being very rude and often takes shots at either Balki, Larry or both, so much so than he often refers to Balki as "Turnip". Mr. Twinkacetti is a ruthless miser who cares more about making a buck, than heeding to the phrase "The customer is always right".
Susan Campbell.
The character of Susan Campbell was portrayed by Lise Cutter. The character was introduced as a regular character in season one, and made two appearances in season two, after which she is never seen again. Susan was the red-headed neighbor and platonic friend of Larry Appleton. In a few early episodes of the series, Balki is shown as having a crush on Susan, and he would throw himself at her feet almost in worship of her, which Susan didn't necessarily seem to mind and she seemed to find Balki to be a sweet person. Not much was known about her, and her character wasn't as developed as the other main characters on the series.
Recurring characters.
Edwina Twinkacetti (seasons 1-2).
The character of Edwina Twinkacetti was portrayed by Belita Moreno, who also played the role of Lydia Markham from seasons three through seven. Mrs. Twinkacetti often stood up for Larry and Balki against Mr. Twinkacetti, making sure they got their Christmas bonuses, and forcing Twinkacetti to rehire them after he drove them to quit. The Twinkacettis were married for 16 years as of season 2, and had two children named Donnie and Marie.
Harry Burns (season 3).
The character of Harry Burns was portrayed by Eugene Roche. He was Larry's boss when Larry first began working at the "Chronicle" in season 3. Despite having high expectations of Larry, he has difficulty remembering Larry's name. After he introduces Larry to Mr. Wainwright in a season 3 episode, Wainright becomes Larry's boss, and Burns disappears from the show.
Harriette Winslow (seasons 3-4).
The character of Harriette Winslow was portrayed by Jo Marie Payton. Harriette worked as an elevator operator at the Chicago Chronicle. Her policeman husband Carl (played by Reginald VelJohnson) is introduced in the fourth season episode "Crimebusters", and the couple eventually moves into Larry and Balki's apartment building. Harriette's character was spun off into her own series, "Family Matters", in 1989, and was not seen again on Perfect Strangers (in turn, none of the Perfect Strangers characters appeared on "Family Matters"), although it was explained on an early Family Matters episode that she was fired as elevator operator, and later rehired as chief of security at the Chronicle.
Carl Winslow.
The character of Carl Winslow, Harriette's husband, was portrayed by Reginald VelJohnson.
Carl's character was likewise, spun off into another series, "Family Matters". Carl was constantly trying to avoid his wife Harriette's questions and at the same time had a sweet tooth, in particular jam filled doughnuts. Carl was on a strict diet and always managed to find a way to eat a few or several doughnuts and at the same time liying to his wife about it with little success. He was always giving wanted posters to Balki for his collection.
Lydia Markham (seasons 3-7).
The character of Lydia Markham was portrayed by Belita Moreno. While suffering from a variety of phobias, and making some very dubious choices in her love life, Lydia was the Chronicle advice columnist. She often got into verbal conflicts with Harriet. She was introduced as a regular character in season three, and was a recurring character until the end of season seven, when the Chronicle storylines were phased out in favor of focusing on the main characters' home life.
Sam Gorpley (seasons 3-7).
The character of Sam Gorpley was portrayed by Sam Anderson. Mr. Gorpley is the head of the mailroom and is Balki's supervisor at the Chronicle. Gorpley never warms to Balki (like Balki's former boss Mr. Twinkacetti before him), who he refers to as "the Mypiot", and Gorpley ends up constantly plotting ways to get Balki fired, which prove unsuccessful. It is interesting to note, Sam Anderson had appeared on the show before as bank employee Mr. Harper in the season one episode "Check This".
Mr. Wainwright (seasons 3-7).
The character of Mr. Wainwright was portrayed by F.J. O'Neil. Mr. Wainwright was the publisher of the "Chicago Chronicle", and became Larry's boss during season 3. His position and somewhat abrupt manner often caused Larry to become flustered to the point of being unable to speak properly around him. Despite this, Mr. Wainwright did eventually promote both Larry and Balki to editor positions, finally taking them out of the basement mailroom in season 7.

Stanley's uncle taught him to play the ukulele at an early age, and at sixteen he got his first recording contract and in 1970 did his first Los Angeles recording session through his friend Cass Elliot of The Mamas & the Papas. Stanley and Elliott remained friends until her death. About his early attempts at songwriting, Stanley said "The Producer told me to write songs, so I did. They were terrible."
Stanley spent time in the United States Air Force during the late 1960s as a Chinese linguist and from 1969 to 1972 studied music at Los Angeles City College and Cal State-Northridge. Upon graduation, Stanley began working as a songwriter for producer Bones Howe, a relationship which led Stanley to a recording contract with Wooden Nickel Records, a Chicago label distributed by RCA.
Early work.
Stanley's first self-titled album on Wooden Nickel was released January 23, 1973 and one month later he had his first booking as a recording artist, opening for Les Paul at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Santa Monica. Though Stanley had a ten album contract, he was unhappy with the promotion offered by the label. "Publicity campaign?", Stanley said. "They made three T-shirts, one for me, one for the president of Wooden Nickel and one for his wife. And there was one group ad with Tower Records L.A. in which my album was included. So far as I know, that was it." Critically, Stanley fared much better. "I received nothing but brilliant reviews. I remember Billboard Magazine, then the biggest music/showbiz mag in the world, choosing only a few albums to spotlight the week I put out "Three's the Charm": Queen's "Night at the Opera", Loggins and Messina's "Sittin In" /Ten Years After with Alvin Lee / and Three's the Charm."
After a positive critical reception for "Three's the Charm" and little support from Wooden Nickel, Stanley asked to be released from his contract which still had seven albums to go. The label agreed. Six years later, Stanley recorded "Midnight Radio" (1980) for Regency Records. A compilation album of Stanley's earlier recordings titled "Eclipse" (1982) was released by Jollye Roger. Stanley then recorded "Racing the Moon" (1984) for Takoma.
Beachwood Recordings.
Following the release of "Racing the Moon", Stanley made the decision to start his own label Beachwood Recordings. Stanley said, "I wanted to make a recording of music and comedy and all the labels said: 'Choose one or the other.' So I chose to start my own label and do just what I do.". Stanley currently records for Beachwood, and tours regularly, performing up to three hundred dates each year. He has performed with such diverse acts as Steven Wright, Bonnie Raitt, Robin Williams, Nicolette Larson and Bill Cosby. Since 1990 Stanley has also been working on a musical titled "Straight From The Heart", the story of two women and their relationship. In recent years Stanley has collaborated on "two man band" projects with Peter Tork, Michael Smith, John Batdorf and Cliff Eberhardt.

Highgate House

Highgate House was an important Northamptonshire coaching inn and Royal Mail posting station at the village of Creaton, on the Northampton to Leicester road, dating from 1663. The building, much expanded and adapted, is now used as a country house hotel and conference venue, but retains its original appearance and character.
Location.
The house is located south of the village of Creaton, Northamptonshire, England, approximately north west of Northampton on the A5199 road and south of the start of the A14 road, which runs from the Catthorpe Interchange with the M1 and M6 motorways, via Cambridge, to Felixstowe.
History.
The current house is built on the site of an earlier inn with the present buildings dating from 1663. When the main Welford road, now the A5199 became a turnpike in 1721 the inn rose in importance. Successive members of the Bosworth family were licensees until 1837 when the establishment of the railways took over Royal Mail distribution around the country more effectively.
At that time the most famous inhabitant was the Revd, and fiery Welshman, Thomas Jones, who came to Creaton in 1785. Unable to find lodgings in the village he resided at the inn in defiance of both fellow clergy and also Canon Law. However, the landlady supported him saying that his presence had a good effect on the conduct of the other customers, and his Bishop turned a blind eye for 51 years. In contrast to other more relaxed clergy he filled the church with his preaching and set up the first Sunday School in the county. Distressed by local poverty he also became Rector of Spratton, a neighbouring village to the south. There he organised a clothing and sick club and employed a woman to teach sewing, all based on his principle of helping the poor to help themselves. With income from the books he wrote, he built six Almshouses in Creaton village.
The house then passed into the Langham family estate at Cottesbrooke Hall in the neighbouring village of Cottesbrooke about 1 mile north, being later bought by its tenant Lt Colonel Charles Eyre-Coote when the estate was sold in 1911. The house was used as a base for hunting with the Pytchley Hunt based nearby. At this time a large amount of money was spent on the house with the addition of a floor and the Baronial Hall, which is visible in the south elevation behind the 3-storey leaded bay window. The Elizabethan linen-fold wooden panelling in the room was architectural salvage.
The building later became a private house and was eventually sold by the late Mrs Coote, in a somewhat dilapidated state, to the Chudley family in the 1960s. It has since been restored and sympathetically expanded and converted into its current form.

Ijnisinya

Ijnisinya (, "‘Ijnisinyâ") is a Palestinian village located twelve kilometers northwest of Nablus in the Nablus Governorate. Most of the working-age inhabitants live as farmers. It has a population of about 560. Ijnisinya is governed by a village council. The village's history dates back to Byzantine rule in Palestine.
History.
The Roman Empress Helena of Constantinople who temporarily resided in nearby Sebastia used to swim in the lake in Ijinsinya with her maids. The area at the time was a small lake surrounded by gardens. Men were forbidden from entering the area by Queen Helena in order to guarantee her and her maids privacy. The name "Ijnisinya" derives from Greek, translating as "the Eden of women" reflecting the original use of the village site. Byzantine ceramics have been found in the area.
In 1596, it appeared in Ottoman tax registers as "Jinisina", a village in the "nahiya" of Jabal Sami in the "liwa" of Nablus. It had a population of 8 households and 4 bachelors, all Muslim, and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and beehives, occasional revenues, a press for olives or grapes
In 1667, during Ottoman Empire rule, Ijnisinya appeared in the list of Greek Orthodox parochial churches. However, by 1838 the village no longer possessed a church, although there were still around 60 Christian residents. Victor Guérin found a small village, with both Muslim and Christians villagers. In 1882, it was described as "a small hamlet in a valley, with olives around it."
Ijinsinya's mosque dates back to the days of Umar ibn al-Khattab and is currently part of the village school.
Roman remains.
There is an Ancient Roman building named "Sheikh Shu'la" lies atop of a hill overlooking three villages, including Ijnisinya as well as, Sebastia, and an-Naqura. The building is originally said to be a Roman monastery seven floors high. The remains of the monastery include stone closets, a prison, galleys, secret passageways, and several wells. Its name, "Shu'leh" is one of a number of Arabic words meaning "fire". The building was named thus because the Ayyubid sultan Saladin used it and similar buildings to transmit messages using fire. 
The Romans used some of the village lands for a cemetery after Christianity became the Roman Empire's official religion. It is popular belief that these graves contain treasures. The graves are generally referred to as "Christian graves", or "Khallet Issa".
Geography.
Ijnisinya is located twelve kilometers northwest of Nablus. It is adjacently east of Sebastia, northeast of an-Naqura, south of Beit Imrin, north of Zawata. Ijnisinya has an elevation of 460 meters above sea level. 
It has a total land area of 6,547 dunams, of which around two-thirds is cultivable. Its built-up area consists of only 30 dunams, olive trees cover 900 dunams, while cereals make-up the majority of the remaining cultivable land. On August 4, 2001, Israeli forces burned over 200 olive trees belonging to Ijnisinya and Zawata.
Demographics.
In the British Mandate census in 1922, "Jenesenia" had 119 residents, all Muslims, while in the 1931 census the village had 30 occupied houses and a population of 157, still all Muslim.
The population slowly grew in 1945, when a land and population survey by Sami Hadawi recorded a population of 200. In 1967 the population was 256. In a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), there were 418 inhabitants, of which 70 (16.7%) were refugees. The gender distribution was exactly even; 50% were males and 50% were females. According to the PCBS, Ijnisinya had a population of 505 inhabitants in 2007.
Before the 20th-century, many of the village's residents were Christians, but following disagreements with its Muslim residents they emigrated to villages with large Christian populations, particularly Zababdeh near Jenin and Bir Zeit near Ramallah.
Water supply.
Underneath the village mosque is a wide Roman reservoir for underground water which, until recently, was still used by the residents of the village as a water source. Queen Helena built an aqueduct to carry water from Ijnisinya to Sebastia but it fell into ruin during a drought in Palestine. The aqueduct is named after her, and it starts from Nablus through Ein Beit al-Ma', Ijnisinya, and then to Sebastia. 
In 2007, the village pump — constructed in 1977 — broke down and the village residents were without water, forced to travel to Asira al-Qibliya to borrow water from that village's pump. A few months later, the Ijnisinya Village Council with the help of the American Near East Refugee Aid, constructed a new pump.

Extrinsic fraud

Extrinsic fraud is fraud that "induces one not to present a case in court or deprives one of the opportunity to be heard is not involved in the actual issues ..." It can involve fraud on the court, but is not necessarily the same.
More broadly, it is defined as:
Extrinsic fraud does not mean merely lying or perjury, nor misrepresentations, nor intrinsic fraud, nor "to matters that could have been raised during the divorce proceeding." It must involve "collateral ... circumstances" such as:
Examples.
Family law.
Probably the most common examples of where extrinsic fraud are claimed are in family law and domestic relations cases, due to the emotions and high stakes involved.
Paternity cases are sometimes the subject of extrinsic fraud; the classic case is when a man is encouraged to sign an acknowledgment that he is the father of a newborn baby, thus giving up his right to contest the matter in a filiation action. In "Love v. Love", the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that extrinsic fraud had led the putative father to sign an admission against his interest, thus allowing the court to grant equitable relief to undo the fraud. It also may occur when a man fails to appear in court when a paternity suit is filed against him, thus resulting in a default judgment due to the fraud by his "paramour".
In such cases, there is a high burden of proof (typically moral certainty or beyond a reasonable doubt) of the petitioner to prove the intrinsic fraud, because of the state's interest "in the best interests of the child" to ensure that every child has a father. That is called paternity by estoppel, in which the putative father is actually prevented from proving he is "not" the father due to the high standard of evidence necessary as a matter of law.
Other examples.
It happens in real estate, such as when a lender forces a homeowner to lose his or her real property in a foreclosure due to the fraud. 
A lawyer who intentionally keeps information from his client about an upcoming hearing or trial could be held responsible for extrinsic fraud, as well as being subject to disciplinary action and a legal malpractice lawsuit. 
It is at least theoretically possible for a court to enjoin a criminal proceeding, but unlikely. A "writ of habeas corpus" or "writ of error coram nobis" may be possible as well.
An activist in Berkeley, California sued the University of California over its long-term plan, for alleged extrinsic fraud.

Cleomenes the Cynic

Cleomenes (; fl. c. 300 BCE) was a Cynic philosopher. He was a pupil of Crates of Thebes, and is said to have taught Timarchus of Alexandria and Echecles of Ephesus, the latter of whom would go on to teach Menedemus.
He wrote a work on "Pedagogues" () from which Diogenes Laërtius has preserved an anecdote concerning Diogenes of Sinope:
Cleomenes in his work on "Pedagogues" says that Diogenes' friends wanted to ransom him, for which he called them simpletons, for, he said, lions are not the slaves of those who feed them, but rather those who feed them are at the mercy of the lions, Fear, he added, is the mark of the slave, whereas wild beasts make human beings afraid of them.
The importance of this anecdote is that it is an early reference to the story of Diogenes being captured by pirates and being sold into slavery, lending credence to the idea that the story may well be true.

<doc id="19335900" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19335900" title="Round Oak Stove Company">
Round Oak Stove Company

The Round Oak Stove Company was founded in Dowagiac, Michigan in 1871 by P.D. Beckwith (Philo D. Beckwith). Beckwith cast his first stove around 1867 to heat his struggling foundry and shortly after, the Michigan Central Railroad ordered the heaters for its depots between Detroit and Chicago. By 1871, Beckwith was mainly producing heating stoves, and thus founded the company.
The origin of the name Round Oak is unknown. The first theory is that Beckwith stoves were round and could hold a section of whole round oak tree in the firepot. The second theorizes that he named it after a foundry of the same name in England.
Round Oak was considered the finest heating stove money could buy because of the quality of its durable heating stove and by the late 1890s there were many “oak” imitators on the market. The company expanded rapidly and at its height in the 1910s, employed 1200 of the 5000 residents in Dowagiac, Michigan. Round Oak’s influence on Dowagiac went far beyond its factory grounds. The company sponsored a semi-professional baseball team and the Round Oak Band. Dances were held in Round Oak Hall.
P.D. Beckwith died in January 1889, leaving the management of the firm to his son-in-law, Fred E. Lee. In 1892 in memory of PD Beckwith, his daughter Kate and son-in-law, Fred Lee built the Beckwith Memorial Theatre in the downtown at Front and Beeson streets. Regarded as one of the finest theatres between New York and Chicago, it hosted such well-known names as William S. Hart, Roland Reed, Robert Mantell and Otis Skinner.The original Beckwith building also contained space used for a bank, city hall and Round Oak Company offices. The busts that decorated the building's exterior included Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Emerson, Whitman, Shakespeare, Sarah Bernhardt and Susan B. Anthony. When the building was razed in 1966, the busts were salvaged. Eight are today used in columns standing at the entrance to the Lyons Building at Southwestern Michigan College in Dowagiac.
After Beckwith’s death, the official company name was changed to The Estate of P.D. Beckwith Incorporated. Most stoves produced after 1890 carry the mark of “Estate of P.D. Beckwith” along with “Round Oak”, which has confused novice collectors as to the original owner of Round Oak stoves – many believing they have purchased a stove actually used by Beckwith himself. The company also added new products, like furnaces and cooking stoves, and introduced a popular mascot around 1900 – Chief Doe-Wah-Jack.
Chief Doe-Wah-Jack, a fictional Native American Indian, appeared on most Round Oak Stove Company and Estate of P.D. Beckwith Inc. advertising and stoves until the company’s demise in 1946. Chief Doe-Wah-Jack was introduced when, with the spread of the telephone, customers had trouble pronouncing Dowagiac when asking the operator for a connection. Chief-Doe-Wah-Jack remedied that problem by providing the town’s phonetic spelling.
Poor management and deaths led to the start of Round Oak’s decline in 1914. Ormal Beach, the company’s first salesman, died that year; Arthur Beckwith, Philo’s adopted son and major innovator of Round Oak products over the years, died of tuberculosis; and lastly, veteran employee Arthur Rudolphi left to start his own furnace company after being denied a promotion. In 1915, the Rudy Furnace Company became the first of three Round Oak competitors to open in Dowagiac, followed by Premier in 1920 and Dowagiac Steel Furnace in 1929.
Round Oak stayed strong into the 1920s and survived the Great Depression, though greatly damaged. World War II government contracts helped the company stay afloat, but once the war ended, Round Oak was in ruins. The company stopped producing stoves in 1946 and in 1947, sold its buildings to Kaizer-Frazer for the production of automobile engine parts. The Round Oak name was sold to Peerless Furnace, which continued to make repair parts for furnaces and stoves.
The complex of Round Oak buildings on Spaulding Street now house Ameriwood Furniture. Today, a small collection of Round Oak Stoves is displayed within the offices of the Greater Dowagiac Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Development Authority, located within the historic Dowagiac train depot. The Estate of P.D. Beckwith Inc. and Round Oak Stove & Furnace Company artifacts are collected worldwide today. The Museum at Southwestern Michigan College has the largest public collection of Round Oak heating stoves in the world. Southwestern Michigan College’s vast collection includes (in addition to stoves) artifacts related to P.D. Beckwith’s grain drill and early stove business, advertising, company ledgers and papers, workers’ implements and many one-of-a kind pieces.

Jeffrey Pfeffer

Jeffrey Pfeffer (born July 23, 1946 St. Louis, Missouri), is an American business theorist and the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, and is considered one of today's most influential management thinkers. Pfeffer strives to educate and inspire leaders to seek power through evidence-based management, the knowing-doing gap, high performance culture, and unconventional wisdom.
Biography.
Pfeffer graduated high school from the Webb School of California. He received his BS and MS degrees from Carnegie-Mellon University and his PhD from Stanford. He began his career at the business school at the University of Illinois and then taught at the University of California, Berkeley.
Pfeffer has given talks in 34 countries around the world and has taught management seminars for numerous companies and associations in the United States including Sutter Health, the Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, John Hancock, Hewlett-Packard, and the Online Publishers Association.
Pfeffer has served on the boards of several human capital management companies including Resumix, Unicru, and Workstream. He also served on the board of publicly traded Sonosite (SONO) for ten years and on the boards of private high-technology companies Actify and Audible Magic. He is currently on the board of directors of two nonprofits: the San Francisco Playhouse and Quantum Leap Healthcare.
Pfeffer has won numerous awards for his articles and books. He was elected a fellow of the Academy of Management more than 20 years ago, was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, and has won the Richard D. Irwin award for scholarly contributions to management.
Work.
Pfeffer’s research interests are very broad. Although he is probably most famous in academic circles for developing resource dependence theory (The External Control of Organizations: A Resource Dependence-Perspective). 
He has done theoretical and empirical research on the subjects of human resource management, power and politics in organizations, evidence-based management, the knowing-doing gap, leadership, stratification and labor markets inside organizations, the sociology of science, how and why theories become self-fulfilling, the psychological relationship between time and money, and economic evaluation.
Elective on power in organizations.
Pfeffer has taught both elective and core classes in human resource management and the core course in organizational behavior. When he joined the Stanford faculty, he developed an elective on power in organizations. First called "Power and Politics in Organizations", some years ago the class was retitled "The Paths to Power". The elective has been consistently popular, with Pfeffer teaching two sections per year and, over the years, other colleagues teaching sections as well.
Writings.
He has written more than 125 articles and book chapters. He is the author of over a dozen books including "The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People First, Managing with Power: Politics and Influence in Organizations, The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge Into Action, Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People, Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths, and Total Nonsense: Profiting from Evidence-Based Management, and What Were They Thinking? Unconventional Wisdom About Management." Pfeffer also has written a collection of 27 essays about management topics, as well as more than 120 articles. Pfeffer’s newest book, entitled "Power: Why Some People Have It—And Others Don't" was published and released in September 2010 . 
Pfeffer has written cases on how individuals acquire power and manage their careers, including cases on Keith Ferrazzi, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, and Laura Esserman. He has also written cases on companies that practice high commitment/high performance work arrangements, including Southwest Airlines, DaVita, the Men's Wearhouse, Holy Cross Hospital, SAS Institute, and the Andean region of Kimberly-Clark.
For five years, Pfeffer wrote a monthly column for the Time-Warner magazine, Business 2.0. For almost three years, he wrote a career advice column for Capital, the leading economics and business magazine in Turkey. He currently writes a bi-weekly blog for BNET/CBS Interactive as well as an occasional contribution for the online On Leadership section of The Washington Post.

<doc id="19335977" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19335977" title="Fred Luthans">
Fred Luthans

Fred Luthans (born June 28, 1939 in Clinton, Iowa is a management professor specializing in organizational behavior.
Education.
Luthans graduated with a B.A. from the University of Iowa with a B.A. in mathematics, and then obtained his MBA, and Ph.D. in management and social psychology in 1965. Henry Albers was his major academic adviser at Iowa.
He also took post-doctoral seminars in management at Columbia University while serving in the United States Army stationed at United States Military Academy.
Academic career.
After service as an Army Captain teaching psychology and leadership at the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY from 1965–1967, Luthans joined the faculty of the Department of Management at the University of Nebraska where he has remained to pursue his career. In 1986 the Academy of Management elected him to its presidency and in 1997 he received the Distinguished Management Educator Award.
Research.
Luthans was one of the first management scholars to apply behavioral science to better understanding and effectively manage human behavior in organizations. This evolved into the now widely recognized discipline of organizational behavior, by far the largest division in the Academy of Management. His book Organizational Behavior. (now going into its 12th edition), is generally recognized as the first mainline text (1973) in this field.
Drawing from his University of Iowa behavioral psychology education, Luthans’ first research stream applied reinforcement theory and techniques to improve employee performance. This led to his second seminal book on Organizational Behavior Modification (co-authored with one of his former doctoral students Robert Kreitner in 1975). A meta-analysis mainly consisting of his studies indicated a strong relationship between his "O.B. Mod." approach and improved employee performance in both manufacturing and service organizations. A recent quantitative analysis published in the Academy of Management Learning and Education Journal on the importance, scientific validity, and practical usefulness of all theories in the field found Luthans’ Organizational Behavior Modification Theory among the eight highest rated (along with those by Kurt Lewin, David McClelland, J. Richard Hackman, Edwin A. Locke, John B. Miner, Victor Vroom, and Bernard Bass).
In the 1980s, Luthans conducted rare observational research to answer the questions of “What do managers really do in their day-to-day activities?”; “What do successful managers (those who rise rapidly in their organizations) really do?”; and “What do effective managers (those who have satisfied and committed employees and high quantity and quality outcomes in their units) really do?” This led to his third book Real Managers (1988). His research found that the relatively most frequently observed activity contributing to managers’ success was their social network skills (defined behaviorally from naturalistic observation methodology to be socializing/politicking and interacting with outsiders). Effective managers, on the other hand, were observed to give relatively most frequent attention to communicating and human resource management activities, with networking given the least attention. This finding that managers who were successful exhibited quite different activities than did their effective counterparts challenged conventional wisdom that promotions are based on doing activities that result in effective outcomes. This research empirically demonstrated the importance of playing the game (networking and politicking) in order to get ahead in organizations.
In the 1990s, with globalization taking the forefront in the management field, Luthans’ research took on an international focus and resulted in his next major book (co-authored with now deceased Richard Hodgetts and now Jonathan Doh) International Management (1991, now in its seventh edition). Luthans previous work in both behavioral management and managerial activities were tested in other cultures, mainly Asia and Eastern Europe.
In recent years, drawing from the positive psychology movement and his own early research on positive reinforcement and, with former doctoral student Alex Stajkovic, on self-efficacy (their meta-analysis published in 1998 indicating a very strong relationship between self-efficacy and work-related performance is one of the most cited in the entire field), Luthans has initiated, defined, built theory and conducted research on what he terms positive organizational behavior or simply POB. With former doctoral student Carolyn Youssef and University of Nebraska colleague Bruce Avolio, this work has resulted in his latest book Psychological Capital (2007).
This positive psychological capital or simply PsyCap is made up of positive psychological resources of self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and psychological resilience. These four PsyCap components have been determined to best meet his POB definitional criteria of being theory/research-based, having valid measurement, being state-like/open to development, and having performance impact. Luthans and colleagues research has demonstrated that this PsyCap is a higher order, core construct. Each of the four dimensions has been found to load onto the overall core factor of PsyCap, which in turn has been more consistently related to both performance and satisfaction than each of the individual components. The key differentiator between PsyCap and most other positive constructs is that it is “state-like” and open to development. Luthans and colleagues (especially former doctoral student James Avey) research has demonstrated that, compared to randomly assigned control groups, PsyCap can be developed in relatively short (2-3 hour) intervention workshops. Luthans and colleagues utility analysis of investing in and developing psychological capital has to date yielded a very high (over 200% in one study) what they call return on development (ROD). This work on PsyCap has resulted in Luthans receiving the 2008 Outstanding Research and Creative Activity (ORCA). Award from the University of Nebraska system.

The Shops at National Place

The Shops at National Place is a three-level, indoor shopping mall located in downtown Washington, D.C. in the 16-story National Place Building. It is located on the block bounded by Pennsylvania Avenue, F Street, between 13th and 14th Streets NW, the former site of the Munsey Trust Building. It is located at the Metro Center stop of the Washington Metro system.
History.
The Shops opened in two phases during 1984 and 1985. It was designed as a central piece in revitalizing downtown Washington, D.C.'s traditional downtown shopping core along F Street, NW, west of the Woodward & Lothrop flagship. The Shops replaced the former flagship stores of Raleigh's and Joseph R. Harris Co.
The first phase of 53 stores opened on May 14, 1984, and was developed by The Rouse Co. The retail complex was hailed as "part of a very important renaissance of downtown Washington." The Shops opened concurrently with a new 774-room JW Marriott Hotel (the first in that chain), and refurbished National Theater and National Press Club.
Melart Jewelers and Sight and Sound Electronics were part of the first phase located in the JW Marriott lobby. 
The 40-store phase two of The Shops opened April 25, 1985. It included August Max, Record Town, and Brooks Fashions among the original tenants. The complex featured a 15-story atrium for the refurbished National Press Club building and 450 spaces of underground parking. At the opening ceremony Mayor Marion Barry proclaimed "Downtown is coming alive . . .!" In 2008, due to many vacancies in the mall, the mall was closed, except for the food court, and the passageway to the JW Marriott. What will be done with the former mall is not known, it may be converted to office space, reopened, converted to a big-box store, or renovated and reopened.

Planter (farm implement)

Like a grain drill a planter is an agricultural farm implement towed behind a tractor, used for sowing crops through a field. It is connected to the tractor with a draw-bar, or a three-point hitch. Planters lay the seed down in precise manner along rows. Seeds are distributed through devices called row units. The row units are spaced evenly along the planter. Planters vary greatly in size, from 2 rows to 48, with the biggest in the world being the 48-row John Deere DB120. The space between the row units also vary greatly. The most common row spacing in the United States today is 30 inches.
On smaller and older planters, a marker extends out to the side half the width of the planter and creates a line in the field where the tractor should be centered for the next pass. The marker is usually a single disc harrow disc on a rod on each side of the planter. On larger and more modern planters, GPS navigation and auto-steer systems for the tractor are often used, eliminating the need for the marker. Some precision farming equipment such as Case IH AFS uses GPS/RKS and computer controlled planter to sow seeds to precise position accurate within 2 cm. In irregular shaped field, the precision farming equipment will automatically hold the seed release over area already sewn when the tractor has to run overlapping pattern to avoid obstacles such as trees.
Older planters commonly have a seed bin for each row and a fertilizer bin for two or more rows. In each seed bin plates are installed with a certain number of teeth and tooth spacing according to the type of seed to be sown and the rate at which the seeds are to be sown. The tooth size (actually the size of the space between the teeth) is just big enough to allow one seed in at a time but not big enough for two. Modern planters often have a large bin for seeds that are distributed to each row.
