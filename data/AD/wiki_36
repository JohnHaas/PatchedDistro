Jean-François Tielemans

Jean–François Tielemans (Brussels, 15 November 1799 – Elsene, 5 July 1887) was a Belgian lawyer and liberal politician. He was interim governor of the province of Antwerp from 7 April 1831 until 14 June 1831 and governor of the province of Liège from 4 June 1831 until 4 October 1832.
Life.
To 1830.
Tielemans' parents belonged to the mercantile middle class in Brussels. He finished secondary school in Brussels then studied law at the university of Liege. For his doctorate in 1823 he produced a thesis entitled "De jure et natura legitimae secundum jus civile et hodiernum" (Luik, Collardin, 1823). He joined the bar in Brussels and was also active as a journalist, especially for the "Journal de Gand".
In 1827 he was commissioned by the Minister of Education in Germany and Austria to study the relationship between Roman Catholic Church and Protestant authorities. He stayed in Vienna and Berlin in 1828 before returning to Brussels, where he was made a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In October 1829 he was transferred to The Hague. However, if the government had hoped that these appointments would win Tielemans over to their side, they were mistaken. Tielemans befriended Louis De Potter and increasingly became an opponent of the government, writing articles for "Le Belge" and "Le Courrier des Pays-Bas".
In 1827 he published one statement about the press and another in favour of the printer Weissenbruch, arguing that a printer could not be prosecuted if the author of an article was known. In 1829 he published a "Brief aan Van Maanen" ("Letter to Van Maanen") who had responsibility for the ministry (Brussel, Coché-Mommens, 1829). This brochure went down badly with the Minister of Justice and the ministry began to put Tielemans' correspondence with De Potter under surveillance. On 15 February 1830 Tielemans was arrested and imprisoned in Brussels. Tielemans, De Potter and Adolphe Bartels then had to appear before the Court of Assize to answer to charges of inciting revolt against the government. Tielemans was sentenced to seven years' exile and went to live in Paris, where he formed a committee to help Belgian political refugees.
Belgian Revolution.
On receiving a letter informing him of the Belgian Revolution, he returned to Brussels and on 6 October 1830 the Provisional Government appointed him a member of the Constitutional Committee and Administrator-General (effectively minister) of the Interior. He was very busy in the second of these roles - he had to organise the administration, national, provincial and municipal elections, schools, public works and measures regarding trade, agriculture and industry, among others. In the sitting of the National Congress of Belgium on 9 December 1830 he released a report reflecting the difficulties he had encountered and the seriousness and complexity of the situation as it had materialized.
Tielemans belonged to the small minority of liberal republicans who preferred unionist cabinets. He was the only member of the Constitutional Committee in favour of a republic, whilst all the others favoured a constitutional monarchy. From 26 February to 23 March 1831 he was minister of the interior in the first cabinet under regent Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier, but he was dismissed after only one month.
Next, on 4 June 1831, he was made governor of Liege, holding it until 4 October 1832, when he was appointed advocate-general to the Court of Appeal by the conservative minister of the interior Barthélémy de Theux de Meylandt, who wished to replace Tielemans as governor with a Catholic. However, the minimum age for a senior member of the judiciary was 35 (Tielemans was then 33), so this was a veiled demotion rather than a promotion. Minister of Justice Joseph Raikem alleged this had been a mistake, but in the meantime a new governor of Liege had been appointed so Tielemans could not return to this post. This left him nothing but to return to his legal practice, this time at the Liege bar (during his governorship he had in 1832 stood as a candidate in the legislative elections, but his opponent won a few votes more and was elected). This did not last long, since on 9 October 1834 he met the age requirement and was made a judge at the Court of Appeal in Brussels. In 1859 he became Chairman of the Chamber in 1867 and first President, until his retirement in 1871.
He was also co-founder and was professor of administrative law at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, where he was also rector (1849–1861). He spent 33 years teaching. In 1834 he and Charles de Brouckere founded the "Répertoire de l'administration et du droit administratif de Belgique" in twenty volumes. In 1865 he received the Annual Prize for the Five Moral and Political Sciences. In 1847-48 he was also a member of parliament, but had to leave due to the law on incompatibility. From 1855-1877 he was also a councilor of Brussels. He was made a corresponding member of the Koninklijke Academie in 1875, full member in 1878 and director in 1887.
Works.
Tielemans had several legal and political texts published in the form of brochures, such as:

Rhabdophis tigrinus

Rhabdophis tigrinus is a venomous colubrid snake found in East and Southeast Asia. Many sources, though not ITIS, recognize one subspecies, "Rhabdophis tigrinus formosanus" of Taiwan.
Description.
The dorsal color pattern is olive-drab green with black and bright orange crossbars or spots from the neck down the first third of the body. The belly is whitish. The average length is usually 60–100 cm (24-39 inches).
Geographic range.
Found in eastern Russia (Primorskiy and Khabarovsk), North and South Korea, China (widespread, except in the western third and the extreme south; Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia), on the island of Taiwan, in Vietnam and in Japan (Yakushima, Tanegashima, Kyūshū, Shikoku, Honshu and in the Ryukyu Islands). The type locality given is "Japan".
Feeding & Defense.
The diet consists mainly of small vertebrates, especially frogs and toads. These snakes forage using both chemical (smell/tongue) and visual cues to find their prey.
When these snakes are challenged at cooler temperatures they tend to demonstrate passive anti-predator responses such as flattening their neck and body and lying still while at higher temperatures they more frequently flee instead. Interestingly this species has two nuchal glands in their neck that sequester steroid irritants obtained from eating toads as a predation defence. This snake thus appears to rely more heavily on the deterrence provided by these glands at low ambient temperatures. Although venomous, few deaths have been recorded due to its tendency to display one of these other behaviors as opposed to striking. This hesitancy to strike at a predator in turn may be because its fangs are located in the back of the mouth making a successful strike on a large object difficult.

Yttrium nitride

Yttrium nitride, YN, is a nitride of yttrium.
Yttrium nitride is hard ceramic material similar to titanium nitride and zirconium nitride.
The nitrides of lanthanum, scandium, and yttrium show semiconducting properties and additionally the lattice structure of YN differs only by 8% from that of gallium nitride. This makes YN a possible buffer layer between a substrate and the GaN layer during GaN crystal growth.

Kieran Modra

Kieran John Modra, (born 27 March 1972) is a visually impaired Australian Paralympic tandem cyclist. He competed in seven Paralympic Games from 1988 to 2012, winning five gold and four bronze medals.
Personal.
Modra was born in Port Lincoln, South Australia, on 27 March 1972, and has been visually impaired since birth. His sister is Tania Modra, who piloted Sarnya Parker in tandem cycling at the 2000 Sydney Games, where the pair won two gold medals. He married Kerry Modra (née Golding) in May 1997, who he met at a friend's 21st birthday party, and they have three children.
Career.
Modra began pole vaulting in 1987 and won the pole vaulting competition at the 1989 Australian All-School Championships.He competed in athletics at the 1988 Seoul Paralympics. He took up swimming to aid his recovery from a knee injury, and began competing in the sport in 1990.At the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona,where he competed in both athletics and swimming, he won two bronze medals in the Men's 100 m Backstroke B3 and Men's 200 m Backstroke B3 events.
Modra then switched to road and track racing in 1995, because it was a "mode of transport".At the 1996 Atlanta Games, where he was piloted by his future wife Kerry Golding,he won a gold medal in the Mixed 200 m Sprint Tandem open event, for which he received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997. In 1998 and 1999, he held an Australian Institute of Sport Athletes with a Disability scholarship. He competed in the 2000 Sydney Games, but did not win any medals at those Games. Modra's pilot, Kerry, was pregnant with the couple's first child at the games, and fainted due to low blood pressure during a quarter-final sprint race; Modra's sister, Tania, was his pilot for the rest of the games.
Leading up to the 2004 Athens Games, Modra was piloted by David Short and Robert Crowe for sprint and endurance events, respectively. Shortly before the games, he was evicted from the Australian cycling team due to a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport by fellow tandem cyclist Lyn Lepore, on the grounds that she deserved her place in the team because when each of Modra's pilot–rider combinations was counted separately, she had a higher rank than Modra. The day before the opening ceremony, the Australian Paralympic Committee successfully appealed to the International Paralympic Committee to give Modra an extra place in the team.
At the 2004 games, he won two gold medals, in the Men's Individual Pursuit Tandem B1–3 event, in which he broke a world record with a time of 4:21.451, and the Men's Sprint Tandem B1–3 event, and a bronze medal in the Men's Road Race / Time Trial Tandem B1–3 event. In the second of the three races in the individual sprint semi-final, Modra and Short fell off their bike after its front tyre rolled off the wheel. Despite having skin torn off their arms, legs and shoulders in the fall, they won the third semi-final race and rode in the final 45 minutes later, where they won the gold medal.
The individual pursuit (B&VI 1–3) world record was broken by Modra and Tyson Lawrence in Bordeax on 21 August 2007, in a time of 4:20.891.
He broke his own world record in the preliminary round of the individual pursuit (B&VI 1–3) with a time of 4:18.961, piloted by Lawrence, they broke the record again in the final with a time of 4:18.166.
At the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Modra represented Australia with Lawrence in the 1 km time trial (B&VI 1–3) and individual pursuit (B&VI 1–3) events, winning a bronze and gold medal, respectively.
In 2011 Modra made a return to the bike with new pilot Scott McPhee where they won gold in the tandem B&VI 4 km pursuit at the 2011 Montichiari UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships setting a new world record of 4:17.780. They placed 2nd at the Sydney road world cup in the tandem road race and 3rd in the tandem road time trial at the 2011 Segovia world cup. In the lead up to the road world championships in September Modra suffered a broken collarbone and fractured hip due to a fall in training. His recovery was swift and he returned to the bike a month later to win the Oceania 4km pursuit championship. In December 2011, he collided with a car while cycling to work, breaking two vertebrae in his neck and one in his spine; this accident hampered his preparations for the 2012 London Games. He won a gold medal at the games in the Men's Individual Pursuit B with McPhee.
Recognition.
In 2000, Modra received an Australian Sports Medal. In 2004, he was named the Australian Male Paralympian of the Year. In December 2011 he was named the SASI Athlete with a Disability of the Year by the South Australian Sports Institute along with McPhee. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2014 Australia Day Honours "Ffor significant service to sport as an athlete representing Australia at Paralympic Games, and to people who are blind or have low vision."

James G. Stewart

James Graham Stewart (May 21, 1907, Homewood, Pennsylvania – March 22, 1997, Los Angeles, California) was an American pioneer in the field of sound recording and re-recording. His career spanned more than five decades (1928–1980), during which he made substantial contributions to the evolution of the art and science of film and television sound.
Career.
In 1928, James G. Stewart was one of the first employees of the newly established company RCA Photophone. Initially, his job was to install and maintain film sound reproduction systems in movie theaters on the east coast of America, including Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Film sound recording and reproduction was a new medium at that time, and Stewart’s knowledge of radio made him a significant figure in the integration of sound into motion pictures. His employers sent him to the West Coast in 1929 to supervise theater installations.
In 1930, Stewart joined RKO Pictures (then owned by RCA), working in their research and development department on a noise reduction system for optical film sound. When corporate interest in the project waned, he was able to move to RKO’s production arm as a 'boom man', recording production sound (the "live sound" recorded at the same time as the picture). For the next several years, he participated in the making of some of Hollywood’s earliest sound film classics, including "A Bill of Divorcement" (1932) and "The Lost Patrol" (1934).
After working in the production phase of the filmmaking process for several years, Stewart switched to post-production. From 1933 to 1945, Stewart was Chief Re-recording Mixer at RKO, personally mixing hundreds of film soundtracks. The most celebrated aspect of Stewart's work during this period is his collaboration with director Orson Welles, also with a background in radio. He worked closely with Welles on "Citizen Kane" (1941) and "The Magnificent Ambersons" (1942). Both Welles and Stewart had tremendous insight into the creative use of narrative sound, and these films demonstrated the spectacular heights to which the cinematic arts can be taken.
Stewart left RKO Studios in 1945, when he was hired by David O. Selznick. He was eventually appointed Head of Technical Operations for Selznick International Pictures and oversaw every aspect of production and post-production for such films as King Vidor’s controversial "Duel in the Sun" (1946), Alfred Hitchcock’s "The Paradine Case" (1947) and William Dieterle’s "Portrait of Jennie" (1948).
In an era when network television was beginning to challenge the film industry for audiences, Stewart worked for Glen Glenn Sound, where he stayed for the next 25 years. Early television post-production emphasized speed and efficiency over artistic innovation, and Stewart’s daily routine involved mixing two half-hour shows a day, five or six times the pace he had previously kept during the making of A-level films. Among the dozens of programs he worked on were "I Love Lucy", "The Jack Benny Show", "The Real McCoys" and "The Andy Griffith Show".
By the mid-1970s, Stewart had changed employer once more, this time to The Burbank Studios (owned by Warner Bros.), where he spent the last five years of his working life. During this time he worked on such films as Martin Ritt’s "The Front" (1976) and Paul Schrader’s "Blue Collar" (1978). In 1980, after a career of more than five decades in film and television, Stewart retired.
Partial filmography.
Stewart worked on over 250 films during his fifty years as a re-recording mixer. Among these were
"Little Women" (1933),
"The Gay Divorcee" (1934),
"The Lost Patrol" (1934),
"Of Human Bondage" (1934),
"The Last Days of Pompeii" (1935),
"Swing Time" (1936),
"Bringing Up Baby" (1938),
"Room Service" (1938),
"Gunga Din" (1939),
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1939),
"Abe Lincoln in Illinois" (1940),
"Swiss Family Robinson" (1940),
"The Curse of the Cat People" (1944),
"Murder, My Sweet" (1944),
"Spellbound" (1945),
"Duel in the Sun" (1946),
"Portrait of Jennie" (1948) and
"Johnny Got His Gun" (1971).

Innovations.
As a teenager, Stewart was involved in early experiments in commercial AM broadcast radio. While at RKO Studios, he participated in the production of the first three-strip Technicolor feature film, "Becky Sharp" (1935), made by RKO affiliate Pioneer Pictures. During his tenure at RKO, he also helped design the studio's first mixing console specifically built for film re-recording and to introduce electronic compression into film post-production. For the film "Portrait of Jennie" in the late 1940s, Stewart devised an early incarnation of multichannel 'surround sound' technology. Working primarily in television after 1950, Stewart helped usher in such technical advances as reversal ("rock and roll") re-recording.
Further reading and viewing.
Stewart was interviewed numerous times about his methods and his working relationship with the film directors and composers with whom he collaborated. Stewart's comments and recollections are included in the following books and films:

List of Grey Wolf populations by country

Though once abundant over much of North America and Eurasia, the grey wolf inhabits a smaller portion of its former range because of widespread destruction of its habitat, human encroachment of its habitat, and the resulting human-wolf encounters that sparked broad extirpation. Considered as a whole, however, the gray wolf is regarded as being of least concern for extinction according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Today, wolves are protected in some areas, hunted for sport in others, or may be subject to extermination as perceived threats to people, livestock and pets.
Wolves tend to have difficulty adapting to change, and are often referred to as an indicator species; a species delineating an ecoregion or indicating an environmental condition such as a disease outbreak, pollution, species competition or climate change. Wolves do not seem to be able to adapt as readily to expanding civilization the way coyotes do. While human expansion has seen an increase in the latter's numbers, it has caused a drop in those of the former.
Europe.
Greenland has a population of 20-100 wolves which are afforded protection in approximately 90% of their range, though no compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Portugal has a stable wolf population of 200-300 which is afforded full protection. Compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Spain's wolf population is estimated at 2,000 and growing. Wolves are considered a game species, though they are protected in the southern regions of the country. Compensation is paid for livestock damage, though this varies according to regional laws.
In Italy, wolves are a protected species, with current estimates indicating that there are 500-700 wolves living in the wild (according to other sources, up to 800). The largest concentrations of wolves occur in the Italian national parks in Abruzzo, mostly in the Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise, in Calabria, in the Pollino, on Appennino Tosco-Emiliano, and, more recently, on the Alps. Isolated individuals have been sighted in the vicinity of human populated areas such as Tuscany, Bologna, Parma and Tarquinia. Wolves have also been sighted denning 25 miles from Rome, with one small population living in the regional park of Castelli Romani. Currently, Italian wolf populations are said to have been increasing at a rate of 6% a year since the 1970s, though 15% of the total Italian wolf population is reported to succumb annually to illegal poaching and road accidents. Compensation is paid by regional governments for livestock damage. Italy's leading wolf biologist, professor Luigi Boitani of the Sapienza University of Rome, expressed concern that the Italian wolf recovery may have been too successful, due to a large portion of the public refusing to concede to the possibility of rising wolf populations requiring management in the future.
Wolves migrated from Italy to France as recently as 1992, and the current French wolf population is said to be composed of 40-50 individuals and growing. Estimates in 2005 put the figure at between 80 and 100. Under the Berne Convention, wolves are listed as an endangered species and killing them is illegal. Official culls are permitted to protect farm animals so long as there is no threat to the national population as a whole. Compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Wolves were first spotted in Germany in 1998, and are thought to have migrated from western Poland. Currently, there are around 150 wolves in 26 packs now roaming in Germany most of them in the eastern German region of Lusatia, and they are now still expanding their range to the west and north. In July 2012 for the first time in 150 years wolves were born in Heidekreis in Lower Saxony, which confirms the spread of wolves from eastern of Germany.
In 2011 wolves were spotted in Belgium and the Netherlands in several locations. The different lone wolves are probably from the French or Italian populations. Since wildlife corridors and wildlife crossings over highways are being created that connect wildlife areas in the Netherlands, such as the Veluwezoom National Park and the Oostvaardersplassen with the Klever Reichswald in Germany, nature conservation organisations expect wolves to migrate to the low countries in the near future.
The number of wolves in Switzerland is uncertain, and estimated at 1-2 individuals. Wolves are afforded protection, and livestock damage compensation is paid by Cantons.
The Scandinavian Peninsula has a population of over 300 wolves (official number in 2012/2013 was 350-410 wolves), that is shared between Sweden and Norway. The Norwegian population is located in the south-east, close to the Swedish border, and consists of c. 30 wolves. The population is protected and compensation is paid for livestock damage. Sweden has a protected population of around 300 wolves, and compensation is paid for livestock damage. The Swedish wolf population is restricted to forested areas in mid-Sweden. The Scandinavian wolf population is open to some immigration from Finland.
The last wolf in Denmark was shot in 1813, but in 2009, 2010 and 2012 there was speculation that a wolf had crossed the border from Germany due to numerous observations, latest in the national park of Thy. This was confirmed after an autopsy, which also concluded that the particular wolf had died from side effects of a cancerous tumor. It was the first known wolf in Denmark for 199 years. In 2013, three different lone wolves have been observed in Denmark. Compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Finland has an almost stable population of 97-106 wolves. Wolves are legally hunted only in areas with high reindeer densities. Compensation for livestock losses are paid by the state and insurance companies. The population is connected to the large Russian wolf population.
Poland has an increasing population of 700-800 wolves which are afforded legal protection except in the Bieszczady Mountains. Compensation for livestock losses is not paid.
Estonia has a quite stable wolf population of around 200, down from around 500 in the middle of 1990s. The official standpoint considers the optimal population to be 100-200. At rough scale the distribution range includes the whole country. In 2007, new version of the law on nature conservation introduced compensation for livestock damage, paid by the state.
Lithuania has a population of 300-400 which are increasing in number. The species is not protected, and only insured livestock receives compensation.
Latvia has an unprotected population of 600 wolves, decline from 900 in the middle of 1990s. No compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Belarus is home to a population of 1,500-2,000 wolves. With the exception of specimens in nature reserves, wolves in Belarus are largely unprotected. They are designated a game species, and bounties ranging between €60 and €70 are paid to hunters for each wolf killed. This is a considerable sum in a country where the average monthly wage is €230. No compensation is paid for livestock losses.
Ukraine has an unprotected, yet stable population of 2,000 wolves. No compensation is paid for livestock losses. Many of the wolves live in the Zone of alienation north of Chernobyl, where they face few natural threats. This applies equally to the Belarusian part of the zone.
The Czech Republic has a stable and protected population of 20 wolves, though there are no livestock damage compensation programmes.
Slovakia has a stable population of 350-400 wolves which is protected, though with some exceptions. No compensation is paid for livestock losses.
Slovenia has a population of 70-100 wolves and increasing. As of 1991, they are a protected species, and compensation is paid for livestock losses.
Croatia has a stable population of around 200 wolves. As of May 1995, they are a protected species, and the willful killing of wolves can result in a fine equivalent to $6,000. However, according to Dr. Djuro Huber of the University of Zagreb, illegal wolf killings increased after the protection scheme began, resulting in the deaths of 40 wolves. Compensation is paid for livestock losses.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is thought to have a population of 400 wolves, though they are decreasing in number and are afforded no legal protection. Compensation for livestock losses is not paid.
The former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro has a stable population of 500 wolves, though it is unknown if they are afforded any protection and no compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Hungary has a stable population of 250 wolves which are protected, though with some exceptions. No compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Romania has an increasing population of 2,500 wolves which are granted legal protection. No compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Bulgaria has a stable population of 1,000-1,200 wolves which are granted no legal protection. Wolves are considered a nuisance and have an active bounty on them. No compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Greece has a stable population of 200-300 wolves which are legally protected. Compensation is paid for livestock losses, with over 80% of it from insurance.
The Republic of Macedonia has an increasing, yet unprotected population of 1,000 wolves, with no livestock compensation programmes.
Albania has a protected population of 250 wolves which are increasing in number, though no compensation is paid for livestock losses.
Turkey has population of about 7,000 wolves. There are some local extinctions especially in the western parts of Turkey and the wolf population is declining in Turkey as a whole. Historically, the wolf has officially been considered a pest species and so it was hunted throughout the year without any limits. It was only in 2003 that the wolf received the status of a game species.
Although wolves in Turkey are not legally protected, the gained status of a game species means that wolves can only be hunted with a license using established quotas which are restricted to hunting seasons. No compensation is paid for livestock damage.
Although wolves in Russia have no legal protection, they number 25,000-30,000, and are probably increasing in number in some regions, such as Koryak Okrug and Kalmykia. Some villages in Chechnya's Nadterechny district have been reporting increasing wolf numbers since the decrease of military activities. On the other hand, in more populated regions of Central and Southern Russia number of wolves is very small. In some regions, bounties are paid for the destruction of wolves and dens. Wolves live in comparatively few numbers in the Sikhote-Alin region due to competition with increasing tiger numbers. This competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters in the Far East to tolerate the big cats, as they limit ungulate populations less than wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Asia.
Syria has an unprotected, unknown number of wolves, thought to be roughly numbering 200. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Lebanon has a population of 50 wolves which are afforded no legal protection, nor is livestock damage compensation paid.
Israel has a stable population of 150 protected wolves. Some livestock damage compensation paid.
Jordan has an unprotected, unknown number of wolves, thought to be roughly numbering 200. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Saudi Arabia has a stable population of 300-600 wolves which are given no legal protection. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
India has a decreasing population of roughly 1,000 wolves which are legally protected. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Wolves in China appear to be decreasing in all their ranges. Currently, Heilongjiang has roughly 500 wolves, Xinjiang has 10,000 and Tibet has 2,000. In 2006, the Chinese government began plans to auction licenses to foreigners to hunt wild animals, including wolves. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Mongolia has a stable population of 10,000-20-000 wolves which are given no legal protection, nor is livestock damage compensation paid.
Kazakhstan has a stable population of about 30,000 wolves. About 2,000 are killed yearly for a $40 bounty, though the animal’s numbers have risen sharply. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Turkmenistan has a stable population of 1,000 wolves which are unprotected. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Uzbekistan has a stable population of 2,000 wolves which are unprotected. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Kyrgyzstan has a stable population of 4,000 wolves which are unprotected. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
Tajikistan has a stable population of 3,000 wolves which are unprotected. No livestock damage compensation is paid.
There are currently no recent or reliable estimates on wolf populations in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan.
North America.
Canada has over 52,000-60,000 wolves which are legally considered a big game species, though they are afforded protection in 3% of Canada's territory. The Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon have 5,000 wolves each, British Columbia has 8,500 wolves, Alberta 4,200, Saskatchewan 4,300, Manitoba 4,000-6,000, Ontario 9,000, Quebec 5,000 and Labrador 2,000. Canada currently has no livestock damage compensation programmes. In the fall of 2012, the government of British Columbia was considering a cull of the wolf population in some areas.
The United States as a whole has up to 9,000 wolves which are increasing in number in all their ranges. Wolf recovery has been so successful that the United States Fish & Wildlife Service removed the western grey wolf from the federal endangered species list on March 28, 2008. Due to the controversy over wolf shootings, a coalition of environmental groups sued the federal government to put the gray wolf back on the Endangered Species list.
On July 18, 2008, a federal judge ruled in favor of renewed endangered species protection.
Alaska has a stable population of 6,000-7,000 wolves which are legally hunted from August to April as a big game species.
Minnesota has a population of 2,900 wolves which are legally protected, though they are occasionally culled for depredation control. Minnesota has been granted complete control over its wolf population, and its wolf management plan establishes a minimum population of 1,600 wolves. Both Wisconsin and Michigan each have healthy populations of 600 wolves as of 2008, in Michigan a spring count of 687 wolves in 2011 has decreased to 658 in 2013.
The Rocky Mountain states (Wyoming, Idaho and Montana) have an approximate population of 1,700 wolves.
Two gray wolves were captured in north-central Washington state in July 2008, one of which was a nursing female. This is the first evidence of reproducing wolves in the state since the 1930s.
In northeast Oregon, also in July 2008, wolf howls were heard by biologists who identified at least 2 adults and 2 cubs. This was the first confirmed breeding pair in Oregon. By December 2011, Oregon's gray wolf population had grown to 24. One of the Oregon gray wolves, known as OR-7, traveled more than to the Klamath Basin and crossed the border into California. Wolf OR-7 became the first wolf west of the Cascades in Oregon since the last bounty was claimed in 1947. On January 14, 2009, the United States Department of the Interior removed the Canadian gray wolf from the Endangered Species List in every American state except Wyoming. This move was blocked by lawsuits filed by conservation groups, but was successfully delisted on April 15, 2011 by the US Congress as part of a budget bill. 
On August 31, 2012, Governor Matt Mead of Wyoming announced that wolves were no longer on the endangered species list in the state of Wyoming; therefore, they no longer need special protections from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The wolf population in Wyoming is now controlled by the state.
The wolf has been extirpated from Mexico since the 1970s when the U.S. and Mexican governments cooperated to capture all remaining wild Mexican wolves and initiate a captive-breeding program in an attempt to save the local subspecies. The Mexican Wolf was reintroduced into the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona in 1998 as part of a captive breeding program. There are now at least 42 wild Mexican wolves in the southwest United States.

Hendon Park

Hendon Park is a 12 hectare London suburban park situated north west of Charing Cross. It borders the Northern Line, and Hendon Park and Northern Line Railway Cutting are a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation.
History.
Hendon Park was part of a medieval estate known as the Steps Fields and owned by the Goodyer family. From 1868 till 1903 it was owned by the Kemp family when Hendon Council opened the park to the public.
The borough of Hendon became part of the larger London Borough of Barnet in April 1965. The park has a Holocaust Memorial Garden, which contains a pond, many plants and is enclosed by large hedges. The Children’s Millennium Wood planted in 2000 is a native tree and grassland area, which will provide a good habitat for birds when it matures. The rest of the park is mainly informal parkland, with mown grass and mature trees, especially London plane and lime. It is a good spot for watching pipistrelle bats on a summer evening.
The landscape includes one of the largest specimens of Acer palmatum in London. Many mature trees survive from the original planting, despite damage caused by the Great Storm of 1987 during which many trees were uprooted and destroyed.
Hendon Park during World War II.
"Rout the Rumour", a large propaganda rally was held in Hendon Park on Sunday, 21 July 1940. The rally included songs, music and sketches. It was intended to promote the idea that gossip and rumour harmed the war effort.
The Hendon Park cafe was originally a bomb shelter, and is a single storey, lead lined, solid brick built building under a flat roof.

2008 Summer Paralympics medal table

The medal table of the 2008 Summer Paralympics ranks the participating National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) by the number of gold medals won by their athletes during the competition. The 2008 Paralympics was the thirteenth Games to be held, a quadrennial competition open to athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. The games were held in Beijing, People's Republic of China, from 6 September to 17 September 2008.
Some 3,951 athletes from 146 NPCs participated in 472 events in 20 sports, with Burundi, Gabon, Georgia, Haiti and Montenegro making their Paralympic debuts. This set new records for both the number of NPCs competing and the number of athletes overall. The design of the medals was similar to those awarded in the 2008 Summer Olympics, featuring jade discs inserted into the medals themselves, with different color discs included for the three types of medals. A total of 21 designs were submitted from designers from the China Central Academy of Fine Arts, Tsinghua University and the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, with the final design approved in the autumn of 2007.
Athletes from a record 76 NPCs won medals, leaving 70 NPCs without a medal. Athletes from Croatia, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Venezuela won their first ever gold medals. Host China topped the medal table with 211 medals in total, including 89 gold medals, while Great Britain placed second with 102 medals, including 42 golds. Canadian wheelchair racer Chantal Petitclerc, S9 swimmers Natalie du Toit and Matthew Cowdrey, from South Africa and Australia respectively, each won five gold medals at the 2008 Games. Brazilian S5 swimmer Daniel Dias won the most individual medals overall, a total of nine medals, comprising four golds, four silvers and a bronze.
Medal table.
The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and is consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a "nation" is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code.
In the judo competition, an additional thirteen bronze medals were awards as the losing competitors in both of the semi finals were each awarded a medal rather than having a playoff bout to decide the medallist. The swimming also saw multiple instances of the same medals being awarded, in the women's 100m backstroke S10, both Sophie Pascoe and Shireen Sapiro swam a dead heat in the final and were both awarded a gold medal, resulting in no silver medal being given that for event. In both the women's 400, freestyle S13 and the men's 100m butterfly S11, two bronze medals were awarded each as two swimmers set the same time in third place.
Changes in medal standings.
On 14 September 2008, Rebecca Chin was stripped of the silver medal she had won in the F37-38 discus competition. The IPC overruled a change in her classification made earlier in the month, making her ineligible to have won the medal as she was reclassified as a F44 competitor.

Association of Young Legal Historians (AYLH)

The Association of Young Legal Historians (AYLH) was founded by 56 young legal historians from over 20 nations in Seville on 8 September 2007. Its main purposes are the organisation of the annual conference "European Forum of Young Legal Historians", the publication of the "Yearbook of Young Legal History" and the facilitation of communication within the scientific community between the annual conferences.
The "European Forum of Young Legal Historians" had grown into the leading conference for up-and-coming legal historians. Its origins were two international meetings in Frankfurt am Main in the early 1990s. The 1999 Zürich meeting marked the break-through towards a truly European event. More than a hundred participants from Europe and beyond came together to attend presentations in the German, English, French and Italian languages. Since then, young researchers from countries which had not been reached before visited the conference in increasing numbers.
The notion of "young" legal historians is understood in a broad sense. The "European Forum of Young Legal Historians" is primarily designed to give all those a chance to present the results of their studies who would not otherwise have the opportunity to do so. As the academic hierarchicies tend to affect the free expression of younger researchers, professors holding a chair in legal history are, as a general rule, excluded from participation to the conference. Similarly, professors and organisations who wish to support the objectives of the society may not vote in the general assembly of the AYLH.
Another special feature of the AYLH is the avoiding of any competing for positions within the association. The executive committee simply consists of the organizers of the last, and the next Fora.

Inbakavi

Inbakavi (baptised Xavier Henric Leam) was a Tamil poet and dramatist
Personal life.
Inbakavi was born Xavier Henric Leam at Manapparai in Tirunelveli district. His parents belonged to the Parava caste. At a young age, Inbakavi obtained the patronage of Don Gabriel Vaz Gomez, the Parava chieftain of Tuticorin and approached the king of Ettaiyapuram. Initially, he found himself unwelcome, but he soon impressed the king by penning a poem in praise of the Raja. The king bestowed many gifts upon him.
After staying for a short period at the court of the Raja, Inbakavi set out for the court of Serfoji II of Thanjavur. At Thanjavur, he impressed the minister Tatooji who developed a special liking for him. However, poor health forced Inbakavi to leave for Tuticorin after a short stay.
In his later life, Inbakavi also toured Jaffna and Colombo. However, respect for the poet had greatly diminished due to his habit of drinking, which also destroyed his health. Before he quit Jaffna, however, Inbakavi penned a drama "Kuruvanji" in praise of his benefactor Philip Rodrigo Muttukrishna. 
Inbakavi died in 1835.
Works.
Inbakavi penned a number of dramas and Tamil poems. He wrote Christian as well as Saivite and Vaishnavite hymns.

Regius Professor of Physic (Dublin)

The Regius Professorship of Physic is a Regius Professorship in Medicine at the University of Dublin, Trinity College. The seat dates from at least 1637, placing it amongst the oldest academic posts at the university. Mention is made in the college's Register for 1598 of an annual grant of £40 from the government for a "Physitian's pay"; this is sometimes held to be the provision made for the Chair of Physic, but it is possible that it may have been in granted for medical services required by the troops stationed in Dublin.
By 1700, the chair was considered part of the senior academic staff, alongside the Provost and Fellows (the professorships in other subjects being confined to Fellows at that time).

Robert Sainsbury

Sir Robert James Sainsbury (24 October 1906 – 2 April 2000), was the son of John Benjamin Sainsbury (the eldest son of Sainsbury's supermarkets founder John James Sainsbury), and along with his wife Lisa began the collection of modern and tribal art housed at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich.
Early and family life.
Robert Sainsbury was educated at Haileybury College and Pembroke College, Cambridge, before qualifying as an accountant.
Robert and his wife, Lisa née Van den Bergh (3 March 1912 – 6 February 2014), had three daughters, Elizabeth (Elizabeth Clark, 19 July 1938 – 14 August 1977), Celia and Annabel, and a son, David, later David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville.
Business career.
In 1930, he joined the family grocery business founded by his grandfather, and became joint president almost 40 years later.
Robert Sainsbury was an advocate of better conditions for the retail chain's employees. Pensions and sickness benefits for all staff came in 1935; overtime payments were introduced in 1941; and, from 1962, the five-day week was standard.
Eight years after he joined the family firm, his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury, retired due to ill-health, and Robert Sainsbury and his elder brother Alan Sainsbury became joint general managers. While Alan Sainsbury took charge of trading matters, Robert Sainsbury specialised in administration, finance and personnel. It was a happy partnership, lasting more than 30 years.
The Second World War broke out a year after Robert Sainsbury's promotion, and there were rationed supplies at the 250 Sainsbury's shops.
Robert Sainsbury was a strong supporter of the Beveridge report, which cradled the welfare state into being. By the end of the war, Robert Sainsbury had cut the long hours which under-18s had necessarily put in - with men conscripted and women on war work.
The 1950s brought self-service supermarkets. Over the period of his joint general management, deputy chairmanship and chairmanship (he became deputy chairman when his father died in 1956, and succeeded his brother as chairman in 1967), the company's turnover increased from £45m to £166m, and the number of employees rose fourfold.
By the time he retired as chairman in 1969, Robert Sainsbury had been a principal architect of the supergrocer's fortunes, which insured its continuing success through to the beginning of the 1990s.
Charitable works.
Robert Sainsbury was as an art collector and benefactor who gave his collection to the University of East Anglia, and was awarded a knighthood in 1969 for services to the arts.
In 1973, Robert Sainsbury made a gift to the University of East Anglia of several hundred paintings, drawings and sculptures from around the world, which he had bought over the decades. Designed by the architect Norman Foster, and with an endowment of £3m from Sainsbury's son David, the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, built to house the works, opened in spring 1978.

5 Years Time

"5 Years Time", also known as "5 Years Time (Sun Sun Sun)" was the first single (record) released by the English folk rock band Noah and the Whale. It was originally released in 2007, but it later was re-released on 4 August 2008, and became their first top-ten hit.
Chart performance.
"5 Years Time" did not chart upon its first release. After poor initial sales, the group chose to re-release the single, and the record made it onto the charts in a number of countries. In the UK, it debuted at number 24, and went on to become Noah and the Whale's first top-ten single, peaking at number 7. In Ireland, "5 Years Time" debuted at number 47 and peaked at number 10.
Music video.
The music video features the band performing in a football stadium, and dancing/playing in the park. During the video, Laura Marling, who provides backing vocals for the group, is seen playing a tin whistle and also giving the camera the two-fingers. The video was directed by James Copeman. The style of the video echoes the style of a Wes Anderson film, using the same typefont the director typically uses in his films/music videos.
The music video was added to YouTube on 13 June 2008, and has been viewed over seven million times.
Commercials.
The song was used in a 2008 'SunChips' commercial.

Shandong Provincial Museum

The Shandong Provincial Museum () is the principal museum of Shandong Province. It is located in the City of Jinan, Shandong, China.
The Shandong Provincial Museum was established in 1954. It houses a collection of more than 210 000 historical artifacts. Highlights of the historical collection include 
relics from the neolithic Dawenkou and Longshan cultures, bronze artifacts from the 
Shang and Zhou Dynasties, stone carvings from the Han Dynasty, and paintings from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The natural history section features fossils from Shanwang and a fossil skeleton of Shantungosaurus. 
The forerunner of the Shandong Provincial Museum, the Yidu Museum, was established by the British Baptist missionary John Sutherland Whitewright in Qingzhou in 1887, it moved to Jinan in 1904 and was renamed to Guangzhi Yuan. In 1942, the museum expanded to a building in the compound of the Red Swastika Society in Shangxin Street. When the Shandong Provincial Museum was founded in 1954, its collection of historical artifacts occupied the compound of the Red Swastika Society, whereas the Guangzhi Yuan housed its natural history collection. In August 1991, construction on a new building for the museum started n the south of Jinan, at the intersection of Li Shan Road and Jing Shiyi Road, near the Thousand Buddha Hill. The building was completed in October 1992, its street address is: Number 14 Jing Shiyi Road, Lixia District, Jinan. In December 2007, ground was broken for a new, significantly larger museum located in Lixia District to the southeast of Jinan's city center. This new museum building was opened to the public on November 16, 2010. The address of the new museum site is Yaojia Street, Lixia, Jinan, Shandong China.

Equivalent impedance transforms

An equivalent impedance is an equivalent circuit of an electrical network of impedance elements which presents the same impedance between all pairs of terminals as did the given network. This article describes mathematical transformations between some passive, linear impedance networks commonly found in electronic circuits.
There are a number of very well known and often used equivalent circuits in linear network analysis. These include resistors in series, resistors in parallel and the extension to series and parallel circuits for capacitors, inductors and general impedances. Also well known are the Norton and Thévenin equivalent current generator and voltage generator circuits respectively, as is the Y-Δ transform. None of these are discussed in detail here; the individual linked articles should be consulted.
The number of equivalent circuits that a linear network can be transformed into is unbounded. Even in the most trivial cases this can be seen to be true, for instance, by asking how many different combinations of resistors in parallel are equivalent to a given combined resistor. The number of series and parallel combinations that can be formed grows exponentially with the number of resistors, "n". For large "n" the size of the set has been found by numerical techniques to be approximately 2.53"n" and analytically strict bounds are given by a Farey sequence of Fibonacci numbers. This article could never hope to be comprehensive, but there are some generalisations possible. Wilhelm Cauer found a transformation that could generate all possible equivalents of a given rational, passive, linear one-port, or in other words, any given two-terminal impedance. Transformations of 4-terminal, especially 2-port, networks are also commonly found and transformations of yet more complex networks are possible.
The vast scale of the topic of equivalent circuits is underscored in a story told by Sidney Darlington. According to Darlington, a large number of equivalent circuits were found by Ronald Foster, following his and George Campbell's 1920 paper on non-dissipative four-ports. In the course of this work they looked at the ways four ports could be interconnected with ideal transformers and maximum power transfer. They found a number of combinations which might have practical applications and asked the AT&T patent department to have them patented. The patent department replied that it was pointless just patenting some of the circuits if a competitor could use an equivalent circuit to get around the patent; they should patent all of them or not bother. Foster therefore set to work calculating every last one of them. He arrived at an enormous total of 83,539 equivalents (577,722 if different output ratios are included). This was too many to patent, so instead the information was released into the public domain in order to prevent any of AT&T's competitors from patenting them in the future.
2-terminal, 2-element-kind networks.
A single impedance has two terminals to connect to the outside world, hence can be described as a 2-terminal, or a one-port, network. Despite the simple description, there is no limit to the number of meshes, and hence complexity and number of elements, that the impedance network may have. 2-element-kind networks are common in circuit design; filters, for instance, are often LC-kind networks and printed circuit designers favour RC-kind networks because inductors are less easy to manufacture. Transformations are simpler and easier to find than for 3-element-kind networks. One-element-kind networks can be thought of as a special case of two-element-kind. It is possible to use the transformations in this section on a certain few 3-element-kind networks by substituting a network of elements for element "Z"n. However, this is limited to a maximum of two impedances being substituted; the remainder will not be a free choice. All the transformation equations given in this section are due to Otto Zobel.
3-element networks.
One-element networks are trivial and two-element, two-terminal networks are either two elements in series or two elements in parallel, also trivial. The smallest number of elements that is non-trivial is three, and there are two 2-element-kind non-trivial transformations possible, one being both the reverse transformation and the topological dual, of the other.
Example 3 shows the result is a Π-network rather than an L-network. The reason for this is that the shunt element has more capacitance than is required by the transform so some is still left over after applying the transform. If the excess were instead, in the element nearest the transformer, this could be dealt with by first shifting the excess to the other side of the transformer before carrying out the transform.

Nuclear power debate

The nuclear power debate is about the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes. The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, when it "reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies", in some countries.
Proponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source which reduces carbon emissions and can increase energy security if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels. Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel. Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most Western countries. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors, and the operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants.
Opponents say that nuclear power poses numerous threats to people and the environment and point to studies in the literature that question if it will ever be a sustainable energy source. These threats include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, and there have been many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.
Two opposing camps.
Two opposing camps have evolved in society with respect to nuclear power, one supporting and promoting nuclear power and another opposing it. At the heart of this divide sit different views of risk and individual beliefs public involvement in making decisions about large-scale high technology. Questions which emerge include: is nuclear power safe for humans and the environment? Could another Chernobyl disaster or Fukushima disaster happen? Can we dispose of nuclear waste in a safe manner? Can nuclear power help to reduce climate change and air pollution in a timely way?
Issues.
In the 2010 book "Why vs. Why: Nuclear Power" Barry Brook and Ian Lowe discuss and articulate the debate about nuclear power. Brook argues that there are seven reasons why people should say "yes" to nuclear power:
Lowe argues that there are seven reasons why people should say "no" to nuclear power:
"The Economist" says that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and that "it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works".
Electricity and energy supplied.
The World Nuclear Association has reported that nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999. The WNA has said that “nuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the Japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year”.
Data from the International Atomic Energy Agency showed that nuclear power plants globally produced 2346 TWh of electricity in 2012 – seven per cent less than in 2011. The figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 Japanese power reactors producing no power during the year. The permanent closure of eight reactor units in Germany was also a factor. Problems at Crystal River, Fort Calhoun and the two San Onofre units in the USA meant they produced no power for the full year, while in Belgium Doel 3 and Tihange 2 were out of action for six months. Compared to 2010, the nuclear industry produced 11% less electricity in 2012.
Many studies have documented how nuclear power plants generate 16% of global electricity, but provide only 6.3% of energy production and 2.6% of final energy consumption. This mismatch stems mainly from the poor consumption efficiency of electricity compared to other energy carriers, and the transmission losses associated with nuclear plants which are usually situated far away from sources of demand.
However the transmission losses associated with Nuclear plants, or indeed wind and Hydroelectric plants, which are also usually situated far away from the sources of demand, are not high, as they use HVDC cables which have losses of just 3% over 1000 km. Similarly Nuclear power is not alone in appearing small when representing World energy consumption which includes non-electric fossil fuel heating and transport fuel, which Coal and Oil dominate. In 2008 world energy supply by power source was - oil 33.5%, coal 26.8%, gas 20.8% (fossil 81%), 'Other'(Geothermal power, peat, biofuels, solar, wind, etc.) 10.4%, nuclear 5.8% and Hydro 2.3%. Oil was the most popular energy fuel. Oil and coal combined represented over 60% of the world energy supply in 2008.
Energy security.
For some countries, nuclear power affords energy independence. Nuclear power has been relatively unaffected by embargoes, and uranium is mined in countries willing to export, including Australia and Canada. However, countries now responsible for more than 30% of the world’s uranium production: Kazakhstan, Namibia, Niger, and Uzbekistan, are politically unstable.
Reserves from existing uranium mines are being rapidly depleted, and one assessment from the IAEA showed that enough high-grade ore exists to supply the needs of the current reactor fleet for only 40–50 years. Expected shortfalls in available fuel threaten future plants and contribute to volatility of uranium prices at existing plants. Uranium fuel costs have escalated in recent years, which negatively impacts on the viability of nuclear projects.
According to a Stanford study, fast breeder reactors have the potential to provide power for humans on earth for billions of years, making this source sustainable. But "because of the link between plutonium and nuclear weapons, the potential application of fast breeders has led to concerns that nuclear power expansion would bring in an era of uncontrolled weapons proliferation".
Thorium-fuelled thermal breeder reactors such as LFTR also have the potential to satisfy the global energy needs for hundreds of thousands of years, while offering high proliferation resistance compared to uranium-fuelled breeders.
Reliability.
In 2010, the worldwide average capacity factor was 80.1%. In 2005, the global average capacity factor was 86.8%, the number of SCRAMs per 7,000 hours critical was 0.6, and the unplanned capacity loss factor was 1.6%. Capacity factor is the net power produced divided by the maximum amount possible running at 100% all the time, thus this includes all scheduled maintenance/refueling outages as well as unplanned losses. The 7,000 hours is roughly representative of how long any given reactor will remain critical in a year, meaning that the scram rates translates into a sudden and unplanned shutdown about 0.6 times per year for any given reactor in the world. The unplanned capacity loss factor represents amount of power not produced due to unplanned scrams and postponed restarts.
The World Nuclear Association argues that: "Obviously sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power, or peak-load power when it is needed..." "In practical terms non-hydro renewables are therefore able to supply up to some 15–20% of the capacity of an electricity grid, though they cannot directly be applied as economic substitutes for most coal or nuclear power, however significant they become in particular areas with favourable conditions." "If the fundamental opportunity of these renewables is their abundance and relatively widespread occurrence, the fundamental challenge, especially for electricity supply, is applying them to meet demand given their variable and diffuse nature. This means either that there must be reliable duplicate sources of electricity beyond the normal system reserve, or some means of electricity storage." "Relatively few places have scope for pumped storage dams close to where the power is needed, and overall efficiency is less than 80%. Means of storing large amounts of electricity as such in giant batteries or by other means have not been developed."
According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, most studies critiquing solar and wind energy look only at individual generators and not at the system wide effects of solar and wind farms. Correlations between power swings drop substantially as more solar and wind farms are integrated (a process known as geographical smoothing) and a wider geographic area also enables a larger pool of energy efficiency efforts to abate intermittency.
Sovacool says that previously intermittent sources such as wind and solar can displace nuclear resources. "Nine recent studies have concluded that the variability and intermittency of wind and solar resources becomes easier to manage the more they are deployed and interconnected, not the other way around, as some utilities suggest. This is because wind and solar plants help grid operators handle major outages and contingencies elsewhere in the system, since they generate power in smaller increments that are less damaging than unexpected outages from large plants".
According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power generators may produce most of the world’s electricity within 50 years, with wind power, hydroelectricity and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation. "Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity". Renewable technologies can enhance energy security in electricity generation, heat supply, and transportation.
As of 2013, the World Nuclear Association has said "There is unprecedented interest in renewable energy, particularly solar and wind energy, which provide electricity without giving rise to any carbon dioxide emission. Harnessing these for electricity depends on the cost and efficiency of the technology, which is constantly improving, thus reducing costs per peak kilowatt".
Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system. In 2012 the share of electricity generated by renewable sources in Germany was 21.9%, compared to 16.0% for nuclear power after Germany shut down 7-8 of its 18 nuclear reactors in 2011. In the United Kingdom, the amount of energy produced from renewable energy is expected to exceed that from nuclear power by 2018, and Scotland plans to obtain all electricity from renewable energy by 2020. The majority of installed renewable energy across the world is in the form of hydro power.
The IPCC has said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years. Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.
The cost of nuclear power has followed an increasing trend whereas the cost of electricity is declining in wind power. In about 2011, wind power became as inexpensive as natural gas, and anti-nuclear groups have suggested that in 2010 solar power became cheaper than nuclear power. Data from the EIA in 2011 estimated that in 2016, solar will have a levelized cost of electricity almost twice that of nuclear (21¢/kWh for solar, 11.39¢/kWh for nuclear), and wind somewhat less (9.7¢/kWh).
From a safety stand point, nuclear power, in terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered, is comparable to and in some cases, lower than many renewable energy sources. There is however no radioactive spent fuel that needs to be stored or reprocessed with conventional renewable energy sources. A nuclear plant needs to be disassembled and removed. Much of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low level nuclear waste.
Amory Lovins explains that even large nuclear plants cannot supply continuous baseload electricity:
Lovins says that nuclear plants have an additional disadvantage: for safety, they must instantly shut down in a power failure, but for nuclear-physics reasons, they can’t be quickly restarted. For example, during the Northeast Blackout of 2003, nine perfectly operating U.S. nuclear units had to shut down. For the first three days after restart, when they were most needed, their output was below 3% of normal.
Since nuclear power plants are fundamentally heat engines, waste heat disposal becomes an issue at high ambient temperature. Droughts and extended periods of high temperature can "cripple nuclear power generation, and it is often during these times when electricity demand is highest because of air-conditioning and refrigeration loads and diminished hydroelectric capacity". In such very hot weather a power reactor may have to operate at a reduced power level or even shut down. In 2009 in Germany, eight nuclear reactors had to be shut down simultaneously on hot summer days for reasons relating to the overheating of equipment or of rivers. Overheated discharge water has resulted in significant fish kills in the past, impacting livelihood and raising public concern.
Economics.
New nuclear plants.
The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multi-billion dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs (with much of the costs of fuel extraction, processing, use and long term storage externalized). Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants. Cost estimates also need to take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage costs. On the other hand measures to mitigate global warming, such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, may favor the economics of nuclear power.
In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which has an impact on large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks. In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out. Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.
Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.
Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.
Cost of decommissioning nuclear plants.
Shutting down a nuclear plant is cited as an extremely expensive process by nuclear power critics, although the costs are usually covered by a component of price charged for electricity during operation. In the UK the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has increased the overall cost for decommissioning all its nuclear facilities from £57 billion in 2005 to £73 billion in 2008, according to the BBC, although this is heavily influenced by cleaning up the non-power generating weapons development facility that was operated at Sellafield. However, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee was told in July 2008 that this cost could rise further and that it is almost impossible to come up with an accurate figure. Stabilising a plant, and ensuring that it is safe is cited as an unknown cost by critics, claiming that decommissioning costs can massively increase the overall cost of nuclear energy.
Subsidies.
Critics of nuclear power claim that it is the beneficiary of inappropriately large economic subsidies, taking the form of research and development, financing support for building new reactors and decommissioning old reactors and waste, and that these subsidies are often overlooked when comparing the economics of nuclear against other forms of power generation.
Nuclear power proponents argue that competing energy sources also receive subsidies. Fossil fuels receive large direct and indirect subsidies, such as tax benefits and not having to pay for the greenhouse gases they emit. Renewables receive proportionately large direct production subsidies and tax breaks in many nations, although in absolute terms they are often less than subsidies received by other sources.
In Europe, the FP7 research program has more subsidies for nuclear than for renewable and energy efficiency together; over 70% of this is directed at the ITER fusion project. In the US, public research money for nuclear fission declined from 2,179 to 35 million dollars between 1980 and 2000.
A May 12, 2008 editorial in the Wall St. Journal stated, "For electricity generation, the EIA concludes that solar energy is subsidized to the tune of $24.34 per megawatt hour, wind $23.37 and 'clean coal' $29.81. By contrast, normal coal receives 44 cents, natural gas a mere quarter, hydroelectric about 67 cents and nuclear power $1.59." The impacts of prior subsidies, some of which may no longer be in effect, are not measured in the previous analysis. However, the Renewable Energy Policy Project stated that from 1947 to 1999, nuclear power was subsidized $145.4 billion, wind power $1.2 billion and solar $4.4 billion. From a megawatt hour basis, this translates into $12.45 per MWh produced for nuclear power, $36.47 for wind power and $511.63 for solar (1999 dollars).
A 2010 report by Global Subsidies Initiative compared relative subsidies of most common energy sources. It found that nuclear energy receives 1.7 US cents per kWh of energy it produces, compared to fossil fuels receiving 0.8 US cents per kWh, renewable energy receiving 5.0 US cents per kWh and biofuels receiving 5.1 US cents per kWh.
Indirect nuclear insurance subsidy.
Kristin Shrader-Frechette has said "if reactors were safe, nuclear industries would not demand government-guaranteed, accident-liability protection, as a condition for their generating electricity". No private insurance company or even consortium of insurance companies "would shoulder the fearsome liabilities arising from severe nuclear accidents".
The potential costs resulting from a nuclear accident (including one caused by a terrorist attack or a natural disaster) are great. The liability of owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. is currently limited under the Price-Anderson Act (PAA). The Price-Anderson Act, introduced in 1957, was "an implicit admission that nuclear power provided risks that producers were unwilling to assume without federal backing". The Price-Anderson Act "shields nuclear utilities, vendors and suppliers against liability claims in the event of a catastrophic accident by imposing an upper limit on private sector liability". Without such protection, private companies were unwilling to be involved. No other technology in the history of American industry has enjoyed such continuing blanket protection.
The PAA was due to expire in 2002, and the former U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney said in 2001 that "nobody's going to invest in nuclear power plants" if the PAA is not renewed. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) concluded that the liability limits placed on nuclear insurance were significant enough to constitute a subsidy, but a quantification of the amount was not attempted at that time. Shortly after this in 1990, Dubin and Rothwell were the first to estimate the value to the U.S. nuclear industry of the limitation on liability for nuclear power plants under the Price Anderson Act. Their underlying method was to extrapolate the premiums operators currently pay versus the full liability they would have to pay for full insurance in the absence of the PAA limits. The size of the estimated subsidy per reactor per year was $60 million prior to the 1982 amendments, and up to $22 million following the 1988 amendments. In a separate article in 2003, Anthony Heyes updates the 1988 estimate of $22 million per year to $33 million (2001 dollars).
In case of a nuclear accident, should claims exceed this primary liability, the PAA requires all licensees to additionally provide a maximum of $95.8 million into the accident pool - totaling roughly $10 billion if all reactors were required to pay the maximum. This is still not sufficient in the case of a serious accident, as the cost of damages could exceed $10 billion. According to the PAA, should the costs of accident damages exceed the $10 billion pool, the remainder of the costs would be fully covered by the U.S. Government. In 1982, a Sandia National Laboratories study concluded that depending on the reactor size and 'unfavorable conditions' a serious nuclear accident could lead to property damages as high as $314 billion while fatalities could reach 50,000. A recent study found that if only this one relatively ignored indirect subsidy for nuclear power was converted to a direct subsidy and diverted to photovoltaic manufacturing, it would result in more installed power and more energy produced by mid-century compared to the nuclear case.
Environmental effects.
The primary environmental impacts of nuclear power come from uranium mining, radioactive effluent emissions, and waste heat. Nuclear generation does not directly produce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury or other pollutants associated with the combustion of fossil fuels.
Nuclear plants require slightly more, cooling water than fossil-fuel power plants due to their slightly lower generation efficiencies. Uranium mining can use large amounts of water — for example, the Roxby Downs mine in South Australia uses 35 million litres of water each day and plans to increase this to 150 million litres per day.
Effect on greenhouse gas emissions.
While nuclear power does not directly emit greenhouse gases, emissions occur, as with every source of energy, over a facility's life cycle: mining and fabrication of construction materials, plant construction, operation, uranium mining and milling, and plant decommissioning. A literature survey by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of 32 greenhouse gas emissions studies, found a median value of 16 g equivalent lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions per kWh for nuclear power.
Climate and energy scientists James Hansen, Ken Caldeira, Kerry Emanuel and Tom Wigley have released an open letter stating, in part, that 
In a published rebuttal to Hansen's analyses, eight energy and climate scholars say that "nuclear power reactors are less effective at displacing greenhouse gas emissions than energy efficiency initiatives and
renewable energy technologies". They go on to argue "that (a) its near-term potential is significantly limited compared to energy efficiency and renewable energy; (b) it displaces emissions and saves lives only at high cost and at the enhanced risk of nuclear weapons proliferation; (c) it is unsuitable for expanding access to modern energy services in developing countries; and (d) Hansen's estimates of cancer risks from exposure to radiation are flawed".
In 2008, "The Economist" stated that "nuclear reactors are the one proven way to make carbon-dioxide-free electricity in large and reliable quantities that does not depend (as hydroelectric and geothermal energy do) on the luck of the geographical draw." However, this is disputed in the literature because of the basic thermodynamic limits to nuclear energy deployment.
Mark Diesendorf and B.K. Sovacool review the "little-known research which shows that the life-cycle CO2 emissions of nuclear power may become comparable with those of fossil power as high-grade uranium ore is used up over the next several decades and low-grade uranium is mined and milled using fossil fuels".
Critics calculate that that if nuclear energy were used to rapidly replace existing energy sources, there would be an energy cannibalism effect, which would impact the carbon neutral growth rate of the technology.
Health effects.
In March 2013, climate scientists Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen published a paper in Environmental Science & Technology, entitled "Prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power". It estimated an average of 1.8 million lives saved worldwide by the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels between 1971 and 2009. The paper examined mortality levels per unit of electrical energy produced from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) as well as nuclear power. Kharecha and Hansen assert that their results are probably conservative, as they analyze only deaths and do not include a range of serious but non-fatal respiratory illnesses, cancers, hereditary effects and heart problems, nor do they include the fact that fossil fuel combustion in developing countries tends to have a higher carbon and air pollution footprint than in developed countries. The authors also conclude that the emission of some 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been avoided by nuclear power between 1971 and 2009, and that between 2010 and 2050, nuclear could additionally avoid up to 80 to 240 billion tonnes.
High-level radioactive waste.
The world's nuclear fleet creates about 10,000 metric tons of high-level spent nuclear fuel each year. High-level radioactive waste management concerns management and disposal of highly radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power. The technical issues in accomplishing this are daunting, due to the extremely long periods radioactive wastes remain deadly to living organisms. Of particular concern are two long-lived fission products, technetium-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and iodine-129 (half-life 15.7 million years), which dominate spent nuclear fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium-237 (half-life two million years) and plutonium-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Consequently, high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the biosphere. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form.
Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.
Since the fraction of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the decay chain of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each over the crust's 3 ton mass). For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by ≈ 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, although the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.
Disposal of nuclear waste is often said to be the Achilles' heel of the nuclear industry. Presently, waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate. Experts agree that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed, guarded, and monitored, would be a vast improvement. There is an international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep underground repositories, but no country in the world has yet opened such a site.
Advocates of nuclear energy point out that high-level radioactive waste is not a fundamental issue for nuclear energy in general, but only for the conventional "once-through" light water reactors, which use only 0.6% of the energy contained in the uranium fuel, and discard the rest as high-level waste. Reactors such as Integral Fast Reactor or Liquid fluoride thorium reactor which "burn" almost all the actinides in the fuel have successfully operated. These reactors can extract almost all energy content of the fuel, and even consume nuclear waste from conventional reactors as fuel, turning liability into an asset. The resulting low-actinide waste reaches safe background radiation levels in just 300 years, compared to tens of thousands of years in case of high level waste from once-through LWR reactors.
Accidents and safety.
Chernobyl explosion.
The Chernobyl explosion was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive contamination into the atmosphere, which spread over much of Western USSR and Europe. It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster). The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles, crippling the Soviet economy.
The accident raised concerns about the safety of the nuclear power industry, slowing its expansion for a number of years.
UNSCEAR has conducted 20 years of detailed scientific and epidemiological research on the effects of the Chernobyl accident. Apart from the 57 direct deaths in the accident itself, UNSCEAR predicted in 2005 that up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident would appear "among the 600 000 persons receiving more significant exposures (liquidators working in 1986–87, evacuees, and residents of the most contaminated areas)". Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and health care costs of the Chernobyl disaster.
Fukushima disaster.
Following an earthquake, tsunami, and failure of cooling systems at Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and issues concerning other nuclear facilities in Japan on March 11, 2011, a nuclear emergency was declared. This was the first time a nuclear emergency had been declared in Japan, and 140,000 residents within of the plant were evacuated. Explosions and a fire resulted in dangerous levels of radiation, sparking a stock market collapse and panic-buying in supermarkets. The UK, France and some other countries advised their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo, in response to fears of spreading nuclear contamination. The accidents drew attention to ongoing concerns over Japanese nuclear seismic design standards and caused other governments to re-evaluate their nuclear programs. John Price, a former member of the Safety Policy Unit at the UK's National Nuclear Corporation, said that it "might be 100 years before melting fuel rods can be safely removed from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant".
Three Mile Island accident.
The Three Mile Island accident was a core meltdown in Unit 2 (a pressurized water reactor manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox) of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania near Harrisburg, United States in 1979. It was the most significant accident in the history of the USA commercial nuclear power generating industry, resulting in the release of approximately 2.5 million curies of radioactive gases, and approximately 15 curies of iodine-131. 
Cleanup started in August 1979 and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1 billion. The incident was rated a five on the seven-point International Nuclear Event Scale: Accident With Wider Consequences.
The health effects of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident are widely, but not universally, agreed to be very low level. However, there was an evacuation of 140,000 pregnant women and pre-school age children from the area. The accident crystallized anti-nuclear safety concerns among activists and the general public, resulted in new regulations for the nuclear industry, and has been cited as a contributor to the decline of new reactor construction that was already underway in the 1970s.
Issues.
Nuclear power plants are a complex energy system and opponents of nuclear power have criticized the sophistication and complexity of the technology. Helen Caldicott has said: "... in essence, a nuclear reactor is just a very sophisticated and dangerous way to boil water -- analogous to cutting a pound of butter with a chain saw." The 1979 Three Mile Island accident inspired Charles Perrow's book "Normal Accidents", where a nuclear accident occurs, resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. TMI was an example of a normal accident because it was "unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable". 
Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely. 
The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable. An interdisciplinary team from MIT have estimated that given a three-fold increase in nuclear power from 2005 to 2055, and an unchanged accident frequency, four core damage accidents would be expected in that period 
The impact of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate practically since the first nuclear reactors were constructed. It has also been a key factor in public concern about nuclear facilities. Some technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimize the amount of radioactivity released to the environment have been adopted. Despite the use of such measures, "there have been many accidents with varying impacts as well near misses and incidents".
Benjamin K. Sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants. Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and 57% (56 out of 99) of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the USA. Serious nuclear power plant accidents include the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), Chernobyl disaster (1986), Three Mile Island accident (1979), and the SL-1 accident (1961). Nuclear-powered submarine mishaps include the K-19 reactor accident (1961), the K-27 reactor accident (1968), and the K-431 reactor accident (1985).
Proponents of nuclear power argue that in comparison to any other form of power, nuclear power is the safest form of energy, accounting for all the risks from mining to production to storage, including the risks of spectacular nuclear accidents. Accidents in the nuclear industry have been less damaging than accidents in the hydro industry, and less damaging than the constant, incessant damage from air pollutants from fossil fuels. Coal plants release more radioactivity into the environment than nuclear plants, through the release of thorium and uranium in coal ash. The World Nuclear Association provides a comparison of deaths from accidents in course of different forms of energy production. In their comparison, deaths per TW-yr of electricity produced from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower, 342 for coal, 85 for natural gas, and 8 for nuclear. Nuclear power plant accidents rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.
The Union of Concerned Scientists supports a national renewable energy standard which would require utilities to produce a certain percentage of their energy from sources such as wind power, solar energy and geothermal energy. The group also supports a national energy efficiency standard for home appliances. The UCS also acknowledges that nuclear power can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but maintains that it must become much safer and cheaper before it can be considered a workable solution to global warming. They support increased safety enforcement from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission among other steps to improve nuclear power. UCS has been critical of proposed Generation III reactor designs. Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at UCS, has challenged specific cost-saving design choices made for both the AP1000 and ESBWR. Lyman is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the AP1000. The AP1000 containment vessel does not have sufficient safety margins, says Lyman.
Health effects on population near nuclear power plants and workers.
A major concern in the nuclear debate is what the long-term effects of living near or working in a nuclear power station are. These concerns typically center around the potential for increased risks of cancer. However, studies conducted by non-profit, neutral agencies have found no compelling evidence of correlation between nuclear power and risk of cancer.
There has been considerable research done on the effect of low-level radiation on humans. Debate on the applicability of Linear no-threshold model versus Radiation hormesis and other competing models continues, however, the predicted low rate of cancer with low dose means that large sample sizes are required in order to make meaningful conclusions. A study conducted by the National Academy of Science found that carcinogenic effects of radiation does increase with dose. The largest study on nuclear industry workers in history involved nearly a half-million individuals and concluded that a 1–2% of cancer deaths were likely due to occupational dose. This was on the high range of what theory predicted by LNT, but was "statistically compatible".
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a factsheet that outlines 6 different studies. In 1990 the United States Congress requested the National Cancer Institute to conduct a study of cancer mortality rates around nuclear plants and other facilities covering 1950 to 1984 focusing on the change after operation started of the respective facilities. They concluded in no link. In 2000 the University of Pittsburgh found no link to heightened cancer deaths in people living within 5 miles of plant at the time of the Three Mile Island accident. The same year, the Illinois Public Health Department found no statistical abnormality of childhood cancers in counties with nuclear plants. In 2001 the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering confirmed that radiation emissions were negligibly low at the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. Also that year, the American Cancer Society investigated cancer clusters around nuclear plants and concluded no link to radiation noting that cancer clusters occur regularly due to unrelated reasons. Again in 2001, the Florida Bureau of Environmental Epidemiology reviewed claims of increased cancer rates in counties with nuclear plants, however, using the same data as the claimants, they observed no abnormalities.
Scientists learned about exposure to high level radiation from studies of the effects of bombing populations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, it is difficult to trace the relationship of low level radiation exposure to resulting cancers and mutations. This is because the latency period between exposure and effect can be 25 years or more for cancer and a generation or more for genetic damage. Since nuclear generating plants have a brief history, it is early to judge the effects.
Most human exposure to radiation comes from natural background radiation. Natural sources of radiation amount to an average annual radiation dose of 295 mrem. The average person receives about 53 mrem from medical procedures and 10 mrem from consumer products. According to the National Safety Council, people living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant receive an additional 0.01 mrem per year. Living within 50 miles of a coal plant adds 0.03 mrem per year.
In its 2000 report, "Sources and effects of ionizing radiation", the UNSCEAR also gives some values for areas where the radiation background is very high. You can for example have some value like 370 nGy/h on average in Yangjiang (meaning 3.24 mSv per year or 324 mrem), or 1,800 gGy/h in Kerala (meaning 15.8 mSv per year or 1580 mrem). They are also some other "hot spots", with some maximum values of 17,000 nGy/h in the hot springs of Ramsar (that would be equivalent to 149 mSv per year pr 14,900 mrem per year). The highest background seem to be in Guarapari with a reported 175 mSv per year (or 17,500 mrem per year), and 90,000 nGy/h maximum value given in the UNSCEAR report (on the beaches). A study made on the Kerala radiation background, using a cohort of 385,103 residents, concludes that "showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation" and that "Although the statistical power of the study might not be adequate due to the low dose, our cancer incidence study [...]suggests it is unlikely that estimates of risk at low doses are substantially greater than currently believed."
Current guidelines established by the NRC, require extensive emergency planning, between nuclear power plants, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the local governments. Plans call for different zones, defined by distance from the plant and prevailing weather conditions and protective actions. In the reference cited, the plans detail different categories of emergencies and the protective actions including possible evacuation.
A German study on childhood cancer in the vicinity of nuclear power plants, the KiKK study was published in December 2007. According to Ian Fairlie, it "resulted in a public outcry and media debate in Germany which has received little attention elsewhere". It has been established "partly as a result of an earlier study by Körblein and Hoffmann which had found statistically significant increases in solid cancers (54%), and in leukemia (76%) in children aged less than 5 within 5 km of 15 German nuclear power plant sites. It red a 2.2-fold increase in leukemias and a 1.6-fold increase in solid (mainly embryonal) cancers among children living within 5 km of all German nuclear power stations." In 2011 a new study of the KiKK data was incorporated into an assessment by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) of the incidence of childhood leukemia around British nuclear power plants. It found that the control sample of population used for comparison in the German study may have been incorrectly selected and other possible contributory factors, such as socio-economic ranking, were not taken into consideration. The committee concluded that there is no significant evidence of an association between risk of childhood leukemia (in under 5 year olds) and living in proximity to a nuclear power plant.
Safety culture in host nations.
Some developing countries which plan to go nuclear have very poor industrial safety records and problems with political corruption. Inside China, and outside the country, the speed of the nuclear construction program has raised safety concerns. Prof He Zuoxiu, who was involved with China's atomic bomb program, has said that plans to expand production of nuclear energy twentyfold by 2030 could be disastrous, as China was seriously underprepared on the safety front. China's fast-expanding nuclear sector is opting for cheap technology that "will be 100 years old by the time dozens of its reactors reach the end of their lifespans", according to diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Beijing. The rush to build new nuclear power plants may "create problems for effective management, operation and regulatory oversight" with the biggest potential bottleneck being human resources – "coming up with enough trained personnel to build and operate all of these new plants, as well as regulate the industry". The challenge for the government and nuclear companies is to "keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners". China is advised to maintain nuclear safeguards in a business culture where quality and safety are sometimes sacrificed in favor of cost-cutting, profits, and corruption. China has asked for international assistance in training more nuclear power plant inspectors.
Nuclear proliferation and terrorism concerns.
According to Mark Z. Jacobson, the growth of nuclear power has "historically increased the ability of nations to obtain or enrich uranium for nuclear weapons, and a large-scale worldwide increase in nuclear energy facilities would exacerbate this problem, putting the world at greater risk of a nuclear war or terrorism catastrophe". The historic link between energy facilities and weapons is evidenced by the secret development or attempted development of weapons capabilities in nuclear power facilities in Pakistan, India, Iraq (prior to 1981), Iran, and to some extent in North Korea.
Four AP1000 reactors, which were designed by the American Westinghouse Electric Company are currently, as of 2011, being built in China and a further two AP1000 reactors are to be built in the USA. Hyperion Power Generation, which is designing modular reactor assemblies that are proliferation resistant, is a privately owned US corporation, as is Terrapower which has the financial backing of Bill Gates.
Vulnerability of plants to attack.
Nuclear reactors become preferred targets during military conflict and, over the past three decades, have been repeatedly attacked during military air strikes, occupations, invasions and campaigns:
According to a 2004 report by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, "The human, environmental, and economic costs from a successful attack on a nuclear power plant that results in the release of substantial quantities of radioactive material to the environment could be great." Such an attack would, however, be difficult to mount. U.S. reactors are surrounded by a double row of electronically monitored tall fences, and patrolled by a sizable force of armed guards. Modern nuclear reactor containment buildings are designed to be impervious to a September 11-style attack. If terrorists were able to gain access to a nuclear reactor, they could do little more than vandalize the equipment. The National Reconnaissance Office's "Design Basis Threat" criteria for nuclear plant security is classified; what size attacking force the plants are able to protect against is unclear. Scramming a plant takes less than 5 seconds, while unimpeded restart takes several hours, severely hampering any efforts to release radioactivity into the atmosphere. Attacks on chemical industry or petroleum industry plants, which are much more vulnerable to terrorism, would result in similarly dangerous outcomes, sometimes more lethal than an attack on the nuclear power industry.
But terrorists could target nuclear power plants in an attempt to release radioactive contamination into the community. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the September 11, 2001 attacks. However, it was in 1972 when three hijackers took control of a domestic passenger flight along the east coast of the U.S. and threatened to crash the plane into a U.S. nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plane got as close as 8,000 feet above the site before the hijackers’ demands were met. The most important barrier against the release of radioactivity in the event of an aircraft strike on a nuclear power plant is the containment building and its missile shield.
Use of waste byproduct as a weapon.
An additional concern with nuclear power plants is that if the by-products of nuclear fission (the nuclear waste generated by the plant) were to be left unprotected it could be stolen and used as a radiological weapon, colloquially known as a "dirty bomb". There were incidents in post-Soviet Russia of nuclear plant workers attempting to sell nuclear materials for this purpose (for example, there was such an incident in Russia in 1999 where plant workers attempted to sell 5 grams of radioactive material on the open market, and an incident in 1993 where Russian workers were caught attempting to sell 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium.), and there are additional concerns that the transportation of nuclear waste along roadways or railways opens it up for potential theft. The United Nations has since called upon world leaders to improve security in order to prevent radioactive material falling into the hands of terrorists, and such fears have been used as justifications for centralized, permanent, and secure waste repositories and increased security along transportation routes.
However, scientists agree that the spent fissile fuel is not radioactive enough to create any sort of effective nuclear weapon, in a traditional sense where the radioactive material is the means of explosion.
Public opinion.
A poll in the European Union for Feb-Mar 2005 showed 37% in favour of nuclear energy and 55% opposed, leaving 8% undecided. The same agency ran another poll in Oct-Nov 2006 that showed 14% favoured building new nuclear plants, 34% favoured maintaining the same number, and 39% favoured reducing the number of operating plants, leaving 13% undecided. This poll showed that respondents with a lower level of education and that women were less likely to approve.
The two fuel sources that attracted the highest levels of support in the "2007 MIT Energy Survey" are solar power and wind power. Outright majorities would choose to "increase a lot" use of these two fuels, and better than three out of four Americans would like to increase these fuels in the U. S. energy portfolio. Fourteen per cent of respondents would like to see nuclear power "increase a lot".
What had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States was eroded sharply following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, with support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropping slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. Only 43 percent of those polled after the Fukushima nuclear emergency said they would approve building new power plants in the United States.
A 2011 poll suggests that skepticism over nuclear power is growing in Sweden following Japan's nuclear crisis. 36 percent of respondents want to phase-out nuclear power, up from 15 percent in a similar survey two years ago.
In 2011, London-based bank HSBC said: "With Three Mile Island and Fukushima as a backdrop, the US public may find it difficult to support major nuclear new build and we expect that no new plant extensions will be granted either. Thus we expect the clean energy standard under discussion in US legislative chambers will see a far greater emphasis on gas and renewables plus efficiency".
In 2011, Deutsche Bank analysts concluded that "the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways". As a consequence, "renewable energy will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems, a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks. At the same time, we consider natural gas to be, at the very least, an important transition fuel, especially in those regions where it is considered secure".
In June 2011, both Ipsos Mori and the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper found drops in support for nuclear power technology in most countries, with support continuing in a number including the US. The Ipsos Mori poll found that nuclear had the lowest support of any established technology for generating electricity, with 38%. Coal was at 48% support while solar energy, wind power and hydro all found favour with more than 90% of those surveyed.
There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency GlobeScan, commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.
Just 22% agreed that "nuclear power is relatively safe and an important source of electricity, and we should build more nuclear power plants". In contrast, 71% thought their country "could almost entirely replace coal and nuclear energy within 20 years by becoming highly energy-efficient and focusing on generating energy from the Sun and wind". Globally, 39% want to continue using existing reactors without building new ones, while 30% would like to shut everything down now.
Future of the nuclear industry.
As of May 15, 2011, a total of 438 nuclear reactors were operating in 30 countries, six fewer than the historical maximum of 444 in 2002. Since 2002, utilities have started up 26 units and disconnected 32 including six units at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. The current world reactor fleet has a total nominal capacity of about 372 gigawatts (or thousand megawatts). Despite six fewer units operating in 2011 than in 2002, the capacity is still about 9 gigawatts higher. The numbers of new operative reactors, final shutdowns and new initiated constructions according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in recent years are as follows:
Stephanie Cooke has argued that the cost of building new reactors is extremely high, as are the risks involved. Most utilities have said that they won't build new plants without government loan guarantees. There are also bottlenecks at factories that produce reactor pressure vessels and other equipment, and there is a shortage of qualified personnel to build and operate the reactors, although the recent acceleration in nuclear power plant construction is drawing a substantial expansion of the heavy engineering capability.
Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035. Platts has reported that "the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world". In 2011, "The Economist" reported that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and that "it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works".
In September 2011, German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. The company is to boost its work in the renewable energy sector. Commenting on the German government's policy to close nuclear plants, Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, stated: "It is wrong to shut down the atomic power plants, because this is a cheap source of energy, and wind and solar power are by no means able to provide a replacement. They are much more expensive, and the energy that comes out is of inferior quality. Energy-intensive industries will move out, and the competitiveness of the German manufacturing sector will be reduced or wages will be depressed."
In 2011, Mycle Schneider spoke of a global downward trend in the nuclear power industry:
The international nuclear lobby has pursued a 10-year-long, massive propaganda strategy aimed at convincing decision-makers that atomic technology has a bright future as a low-carbon energy option... however, most of the high-flying nuclear plans never materialized. The historic maximum of reactors operating worldwide was achieved in 2002 with 444 units. In the European Union the historic peak was reached as early as 1988 with 177 reactors, of which only 134 are left. The only new projects underway in Europe are heavily over budget and much delayed.
As "Time" magazine rightly stated in March, "Nuclear power is expanding only in places where taxpayers and ratepayers can be compelled to foot the bill." China is building 27 -- or more than 40 percent -- of the 65 units officially under construction around the world. Even there, though, nuclear is fading as an energy option. While China has invested the equivalent of about $10 billion per year into nuclear power in recent years, in 2010 it spent twice as much on wind energy alone and some $54.5 billion on all renewables combined.
In contrast, proponents of nuclear power argue that nuclear power has killed by far the fewest number of people per terawatt hour of any type of power generation, and it has a very small impact on the environment with effectively zero emissions of any kind. And this even taking into account the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents, in which few people were killed directly and few excess cancers will be caused by releases of radioactivity to the environment. Some proponents acknowledge that most people will not accept this sort of statistical argument nor will they believe reassuring statements from industry or government. Indeed, the industry itself has created fear of nuclear power by pointing out that radioactivity can be dangerous. Improved communication by industry might help to overcome current fears regarding nuclear power, but it will be a difficult task to change current perceptions in the general population.
But with regard to the proposition that "Improved communication by industry might help to overcome current fears regarding nuclear power", M.V. Ramana says that the basic problem is that there is "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by safety violations by nuclear companies, or through ineffectiveness or corruption on the part of nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain. Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful.
In March 2012, E.ON UK and RWE npower announced they would be pulling out of developing new nuclear power plants in the UK, placing the future of nuclear power in the UK in doubt.
More recently, Centrica (who own British Gas) pulled out of the race on 4 February 2013 by letting go its 20% option on four new nuclear plants.
Cumbria county council (a local authority) turned down an application for a final waste repository on 30 January 2013 — there is currently no alternative site on offer.

<doc id="19216225" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19216225" title="Bicolline">
Bicolline

Bicolline is a fantasy live action role-playing game (LARP) campaign in Quebec. Events take place at a dedicated venue covering 140 hectares called the "Duchy of Bicolline" located in Saint-Mathieu-du-Parc near Shawinigan. 
Venue.
The most passionate players involved over the years have built a medieval village with roads, bridges, ditches, an inn and a castle at the "Duchy of Bicolline" venue. Construction days are scheduled throughout spring and summer. Players are responsible for their buildings and must follow standards of construction. The village is composed of one hundred buildings, with more being added. The demand for construction sites is such that one Bicolline staff member spends all year controlling applications, validating the plans for buildings, ensuring that projects are feasible, and so on.
Setting.
The world of Bicolline has its own geography, economy, conflicts, and complex geopolitics that have been evolving since its inception in response to the actions of the players. The geopolitical system is based on feudal Europe, and is the basis for most of the actions undertaken on the ground during the events.
The complexity of the setting is such that it is almost impossible for an individual to control more than one area of competition such as commercial, political, military, or religious. Generally, guilds specialize and focus on one or two aspects of the game. The guilds have diverse experts among their members, each able to follow the changes and fully understand one aspect of the world of Bicolline.
The political arena consists of fiefdoms, provinces that form the kingdom. All levels of politics can be filled by players, making the world very dynamic. Accession to titles of nobility follows a democratic system. This modern aspect helps to make the experience accessible to all. It is possible to create internal conflicts and external playing with virtual units. These virtual wars can be realized in a fight during real scenarios on the ground.
The commercial aspect of the game is constantly changing, following an in-game market. Goods are transacted at extremely variable prices depending on their availability and the stability of the kingdom. Bicolline mints its own coins, called the Solar, that are the currency of transaction.
Guilds.
The basic unit of organisation both in-game and out-of-game is the "guild". Guilds are voluntary groupings of players promoting an event, a race or a common goal. Typically a guild has about thirty members. There are sometimes unguilded "clans" with fewer members which will usually eventually form a registered guild. The guild structure allows efficient distribution of information and gives players a weight in the game beyond what they can achieve as individual characters. There are currently 60 recorded guilds and clans. 
The majority of the guild can be divided into broad categories: military, commercial, political, religious, criminal, and magical. Each is affiliated with one or more kingdoms in the world of Bicolline: Empire, Andorra, Arganne, Ozame, Nasgaroth, Garganesh, Irendill, Taluskan, Sands-City, Berkwald, and the Independent Cities.
System.
Unlike some LARPs, Bicolline does not have a character creation system. The players can portray any kind of character that they are able to roleplay.
Activities.
As many as 2000 players each year attend the main event "The Great Battle of Bicolline". Dozens of volunteers and a core group of employees work all year to create one of the world's largest and most immersive LARP settings. In addition to the Great Battle various events are held throughout the year including the "Feast of Gallion" (approximately 600 people in March), tavern evenings (100 people about 7-8 times per year) and campaigns and battle scenarios of all kinds that usually attract several hundred people.
The Great Battle of Bicolline.
Every year since 1996 a large LARP has been organised at the venue. The Great Battle of Bicolline brings together around 2000 LARPers and medieval reenactors over seven days, and culminates in a huge battle. The battle is prepared for throughout the year with skirmishes and diplomacy between the various groups that attend.
Trollball.
Trollball is a demanding, exhausting and dramatic sport played in Bicolline and other LARP settings. It is played in Europe and Canada, with many teams competing. Trollball was started by Jose Antonio Ouellette in 1995. 
The goal of the game is put the troll head in a well without being hit by the foam weapons of the opposing team's attackers. Each player has a clearly-defined position within their team such as Troller, Healer, Attacker or Reserve. Strategy, group cohesiveness and solid fighting skills are major assets in this sport.

Navigrid

Navigrid is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The puzzler is provided with a set of movements which must be used to move between the numbers 1 to 9 in order starting with the number 1. A solved grid will contain each of the numbers 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid.
The puzzle was invented by an English puzzle enthusiast, Laurence May, in 2006 and was first published by BBC MindGames Magazine where it appeared in all 9 issues. It is produced by Vexus Puzzle Design and is currently represented by Puzzler Media. The puzzle appears along with Sudoku and Kakuro in their "Kakuro" magazine.
Rules.
When the grid is completed, it must be possible to use every one of the 8 movements to journey from the number 1 to the number 2, the number 2 to the number 3 and so on until you can move from the number 8 to the number 9. A movement must not take you through a black square.
Movements.
Both parts of a movement must be used but they can be used in either order. Example movements are shown in the first image above. The first movement represents a move of either two squares to the left and then one square down or one square down and then two squares to the left.

Wu Style Tai Chi Fast Form

The different slow motion solo form training sequences of t'ai chi ch'uan are the best known manifestation of t'ai chi for the general public. In English, they are usually called the "hand form" or just the "form"; in Mandarin it is usually called "ch'uan" ().
They are performed slowly by beginners and are said to promote concentration, condition the body and acquaint students with the inventory of motion techniques for more advanced styles of martial arts training. There are also solo weapons forms, as well as much shorter and repetitive sequences to train power generation leverages as a form of qigong (ch'i kung). The various forms of Wu-style pushing hands have two person drill routines as well, which fulfil some of the same functions as the power generation drills.
In 1914 Xi Yui-seng established the Athletic Research Institute in Beijing and Invited Yang Shao-hou, Yang Chengfu and Wu Chien-ch'uan to teach. From then on T'ai Chi was taught to the public changing the ancient closed door policy where T'ai Chi was only taught privately to very close and well known people within a limited circle known as the tutor disciple relationship.
Grand Master Wu Chien-ch'uan revised and enriched the art of t'ai chi ch'uan handed down from his father Wu Ch'uan-yu. His development of the slow set led to the creation of the style of t'ai chi today known as Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan .
He omitted some of the repetitions, Fa-jing, stamping and jumping movements to make the form smoother, more structured with continuous steady movements. This form promoted the health aspects of Tai Chi and was more suitable for general practitioners though it still contained all the martial applications and training. 
Yang Chengfu of Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan also modified his own Yang style in a similar way at the same time. His brother, Yang Shou-hao's form had a high frame with lively steps alternating between fast and slow movements with hard and crisp Fa-jing. Chen Pan-ling, who was a student of Yang Shao-hao and Wu Chien-chuan describes T'ai Chi form practice beginning with slow movement changing to fast and returning to slow movement. He also points out learning to exercise rapid movement in the form and training from soft to hard and hard to soft movements. 
The Shanghai Wu-style Fast Form kept the original Fa-jing 發勁 (release of power), jumping, attacking and stamping movements to be studied by those eager to advance their T'ai Chi practice. This advanced form was not yet taught openly.
In December 1982 there was a martial arts meeting held in Beijing to foster the traditional martial arts of China. Wu Ying-hua and Ma Yueh-liang of The Shanghai Jianquan Taijiquan Association contributed to this effort by disclosing the original Wu-style Fast Set for the first time to the public. In 1983 their adopted daughter Shi Mei Lin demonstrated the Wu-style T'ai Chi Fast Form at the All China Traditional Martial Arts competition in Nanchang where she received the Award of Excellence.
Other Wu-style fast forms.
The Wu family's Hong Kong branch also teaches a somewhat different fast form.
Shanghai Wu-style fast form list.
The following list is an English translation from Chinese of the empty hand or fist form list published in Ma Yueliang's, Wu Yinghua's and Shi Mei Lin's "Wu-style T'ai chi Fast Form'. (Note: Traditionally this set consists of 108 forms. For transcribing purposes some of the repeated forms are given one reference number in both the Chinese and English versions of the Wu-style Fast Form book.)

Jabel Mukaber

Jabel Mukaber () () is a predominantly Arab neighborhood in southern East Jerusalem. It is bordered by East Talpiot to the west, Abu Tor and Silwan to the north and Sur Baher to the south. Jabel Mukaber has a population of 14,000.
History.
According to local legend, Jabel Mukaber is named after Umar ibn al-Khattab, a disciple of Muhammad and the second caliph of the Islamic Caliphate, who cried "Allahu Akbar" at this site. During the Mandatory Palestine, the offices of the British High Commissioner, the representative of British imperial rule in Palestine were located in Jabel Mukaber. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood battled Jewish forces in the neighborhood. Jabel Mukaber and other Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem were captured and annexed by Jordan. Since the 1967 Six-Day War, Jabel Mukaber has been under the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem Municipality.
Demography.
Many residents of Jabel Mukaber rejected Israeli citizenship to demonstrate their solidarity with Palestinians in the West Bank, but they are considered permanent residents. As holders of blue identity cards, they have wide freedom of movement within Israel, and have access to health care, unemployment and other benefits.
The construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has divided Jabel Mukaber in half and left some neighborhood residents on the West Bank side of the wall, meaning that they hold orange IDs instead of blue IDs, and cannot cross into Israel itself. Running through the centre of the neighbourhood, the barrier often separates members of the same family from one another, interrupting normal family life. Jabel Mukaber is under-budgeted for municipal services, leading to sewage blockages in parts of the neighborhood and a shortage of classrooms.
Arab-Israeli conflict.
East Talpiot was established in 1970 in close proximity to Jabel Mukaber during the upswing of building that followed the Six-Day War. When the Intifada (uprising) began, the mood changed. Since then, Jabel Mukaber has been the scene of numerous demonstrations, protests and riots in support of the Palestinian cause.
Two residents of Jabel Mukaber were convicted for transporting a suicide bomber from Bethlehem who perpetrated the Patt Junction Bus Bombing in 2002, killing 19 people and wounding over 74. In 2006, a Jabel Mukaber resident opened fire on Israeli policemen and security guards injuring one of them before he was shot dead. The perpetrator of the 2008 Mercaz HaRav massacre, Alaa Abu Dhein, was from Jabel Mukaber. Following the attack, in which eight high school students were killed, the residents of Jabel Mukaber erected a mourners' tent for him. Israeli protesters tried to break through police barricades outside Jabel Mukaber, resulting in the arrest of 13 protesters. In 2008, a Jabel Mukaber resident rammed a group of Israelis with his car.
Landmarks.
A Tolerance Monument sculpted by Czesław Dźwigaj in collaboration with Michal Kubiak is situated on a hill marking the divide between Jewish East Talpiot and Arab Jabel Mukaber, standing opposite the United Nations headquarters in Jerusalem in a park near Goldman Promenade. Unveiled in Jerusalem in 2008, it was funded by Polish businessman Aleksander Gudzowaty as a symbol to promote peace in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

Avraham Ahituv

Avraham Ahituv, born Avraham Gottfried (December 10, 1930 – July 15, 2009) was a German-born Israeli civil servant, having served as Director of the Shabak, the Israel Security Agency, from 1974 to 1980.
Ahituv's family immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine in 1935. In 1946 Ahituv joined the Haganah while a student in the Kfar Ha-Ro'eh seminary, where he completed his high school matriculation test. In 1949 Ahituv joined the Internal Intelligence Service, (SHAI), founded during the Israeli War of Independence and later became the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). During the conflict period, Gottfried changed his name to Ahituv. Through the 1950s Ahituv served in the Arab division of the Shin Bet. Ahituv was instrumental in adopting a policy of "practical moderation" in relation to the Israeli Arab demographic. This policy was to enable full integration of the Israeli Arab population into Israeli main stream society. Ahituv authorized the use of lies in Israeli courts to cover confessions obtained by torture. In August 1982 a controversial report appeared in "The Washington Star", indicating that Ahituv's resignation was caused by the intervention of Prime Minister Begin in the investigations in the bombing of Palestinian town mayors by Jewish extremist groups. The allegation was denied by both Begin and Ahituv. After Ahituv testified that his resignation had been submitted before the spate of bombs, the Knesset defense dismissed the "Washington Star" report as "groundless" and having "no basis in fact".

KVINFO

This article is about The Danish Center for Research on Women and Gender (KVINFO). The name KVINFO is an abbreviation of the Danish words 'køn', 'viden', "i"nformation', and "f"orskning', meaning "gender", "information", and "research".
The center primary aim is to provide the general public with information about the results of women's studies and gender research undertaken in Denmark and internationally.
KVINFO's core resource is a library of more than 20,000 books, journals and political publications dealing with equal opportunities and women's issues. 
This library may be seen as an example of a broader, more holistic concept of a library because it actually carries out important functions related to modern information centres.
For example, it edits a web magazine, an online Biographical Encyclopedia of Danish Women, a database of women professionals, web stories on key periods in the history of Danish women.
Furthermore, it coordinates special programs such as the mentor-network for women of all ethnic backgrounds living in Denmark, and the women's dialogue pro rights and equal opportunities in the Middle East.
History.
KVINFO is the only women's library in Denmark. Its history goes back to 1964 when the founder Nynne Koch, who at the time worked at the Danish Royal Library in Copenhagen as a secretary, initiated a women's documentation service. She was allocated 15 minutes a day in which to register incoming books on women's issues in a card catalogue.
Such initiative allowed KVINFO to develop a unique classification and subject indexing system invented by Koch and developed over the years by special librarians. The system takes into account the particular needs of researchers specialized in women and gender studies in a way that posts in the catalogue are enriched with key words giving each post as many search entrances as possible.
By 1982, KVINFO was established as a four year experiment funded by the Danish Ministry of Culture. Koch and her staff of volunteers moved to a new venue and expanded their activities. In 1987 the center became a self-governing institution.
Elisabeth Møller Jensen has been the director of KVINFO since 1990. During her directorship KVINFO's budget and staff has increased threefold, the center's magazine has been redesigned, relaunched and circulation doubled and the database project, the first online database of women experts in Europe, has gone in the Internet.
Furthermore the center has implemented information technology on all levels and functions as coordinator for the Danish Ministry of Culture's project Cultural Network Denmark.
Documentation and information services.
Although KVINFO has its roots in the Danish library sector, for the past eighteen years it has also contributed to bring women's politics and women's research into the forefront of cultural debate in Scandinavia.
In addition to collecting and registering publications on women's studies, gender studies, men's studies, queer studies, gender equality, valid statistics, biographies, autobiographies, and so forth, KVINFO communicates with national and international audiences via several information services.
KVINFO's magazine, Forum, first paper edition appeared in 1982 and for the next ten years was the only Danish women's studies journal. In 1998 it became a web magazine in order to reach new groups of readers and place gender on their agenda.
Forum's main purpose is to increase the visibility of Danish women and of gender issues and to create links and contact to other women and gender researchers globally. It is mainly published in Danish.
Launched in 2003 under the Danish name "Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon", this encyclopaedia contains approximately 2000 Danish women all pioneers within their field, i.e. within education, nursing, science, music, etc., or central figures within the suffrage movement, politics, women's organizations, research, business and so forth. This material is available to the general public free of charge on the Internet.
In 1995, KVINFO set up a database of women experts in Denmark called Women Online. This database provides easy access to biographical information on a large number of contemporary women who are opinion leaders, senior managers, politicians, researchers and experts within a wide range of subjects. It provides a broad selection of candidates for appointments in private and public office, for committees, tribunals, commissions and councils, and offers names for speakers, teachers, facilitators and consultants.
KVINFO launched this website in November 2001 and the idea behind it is to tell the story of Danish women's road to equal opportunities from 1850 to 1920. Documents on important landmarks such as the suffrage, women's access to education and employment, women's fight for independence and the debate on sexual morality are available in Danish in the Internet.
Other activities.
KVINFO is involved in many other projects. Besides arranging a wide range of lectures, seminars and cultural events, the center has strengthen its services coordinating programs supporting women's right in the Middle East and providing opportunities for immigrant women in Denmark. 
In 2001 the Danish women's movement in general, and KVINFO in particular, were criticized for letting down immigrant women. 
By 2003 a Mentor Network was set op for the benefit of refugee and immigrant women living in Denmark. The idea was to match KVINFO's rich networks of strong, committed, well educated women with refugee and immigrant women.
Through one-on-one meetings of equals, women-mentors provide access to their professional networks and give appropriate advice regarding job applications, job interviews, workplace culture and reassessment of employment potential.
It has been estimated than more than 50 percent of all job openings in Denmark are filled via personal networks. Networks are essential to gain a foothold in Danish society. Women immigrants are matched with a Danish mentor based on the educational background, profession and personal wishes.
At the moment more than 3,000 women are part of KVINFO's network, which is organized in four branches and in four different Danish cities.
Created in 2006, KVINFO's Middle East initiative is the result of a wish to create a bridging frame to the bilateral partnership between Denmark and different Arab countries that currently focus on promoting gender equality and women's rights. 
The program works supporting proposals for capacity building of civil society organisations, especially women's organizations, in four strategic areas:
Legal change, women's participation in the public sphere, domestic violence, and research, documentation and information on gender related issues 
In its initial phase KVINFO's initiative includes Morocco, Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.
Controversy.
During the first decade of the new millennium KVINFO had its funding increased and has become much more publicly outspoken. So has criticism that the organization is not purely informational and objective, but quite biased. Notably, the organization has been criticized for not wanting equal rights, but positive discrimination in favor of women. Also the organization has been criticized for having a clear left-wing political bias. An example viewed by some as documentation of this last criticism is their 2010 yearly report on how the gender debate is coming along. In 2010 there had been a very strong trend of non-leftish, Danish, female gender issue debaters who (among other things) questioned if positive discrimination and quotas (on how many percent women there should be on a board, for instance) were the right thing. This strong trend was mentioned only in a non-flattering comparison to Sarah Palin.

Franz Josef Ritter von Buß

Franz Joseph, Ritter von Buss (23 March 1803, Zell am Harmersbach - 31 January 1878, Freiburg im Breisgau) was a German Roman Catholic jurist, activist and politician.
Life.
He studied at the University of Freiburg where he took the doctor's degree in philosophy, law, and medicine. After a short stay at the Universities of Bonn and Göttingen he returned to Freiburg, passed his examination and was appointed attorney for that city. He became ordinary professor at the university in 1836, and obtained a following among the students, because he treated vexed social and ecclesiastical problems. To meet his many opponents Buss often lectured four, even five, times a day. 
Besides a modern language club of which he was the founder and president, he gave much of his time to creating at Freiburg a centre for the comparative study of European legislation and jurisprudence. He soon found, however, that the means of international correspondence were inadequate to the enterprise. Some of the material collected appeared in book form (1835–46), the sole fruit of the scheme.
In 1837 Buss was elected to the Lower House of the Grand Duchy of Baden, and addressed himself at once to such subjects as the social question, the liberty of the Catholic Church, a uniform customs system, and closer commercial union between the States of Germany. Buss met from the beginning a hostile majority, and he was reproached in open Parliament with errors and false steps of his youth. Unable to make the least impression, he resigned his seat. Elected again in 1846, Buss opposed the "Deutschkatholicismus" of Ronge. This brought out his opponents in full force. Extensive petitions in his favor compelled the Government to dissolve the Parliament; but the new election brought no improvement. Buss was the only champion of the Catholic Church in the Lower House, whilst in the upper the weight of the opposition fell on Baron von Andlau and his colleague Hirscher.
He introduced the Sisters of Charity into Baden; transformed his own house into an ecclesiastical college; during the famine of the winter of 1846 he fed thousands of starving people in the Black Forest; and he organized the Catholics politically and formed them into societies. In 1848 Buss presided over the first general assembly of the German Catholic associations (Katholikentag) in Mainz. He represented Ahaus-Steinfurt in the German Parliament at Frankfurt. There, as in the Erfurt Union Parliament, where he was the leader of the Greater-Germany Party, he favoured Austria as against Prussia. When opposition to the Catholic Church in Baden developed into open hostility, Buss was at the side of the archbishop, Hermann von Vicari. 
He was elected for the third time to the Baden Landtag when the Concordat between Baden and the Holy See was in jeopardy. He at once organized a popular deputation to the sovereign, comprising representatives from all the parishes of Baden. But the old opposition prevented the demonstration, invalidated his election, and ejected him from the Landtag, and finally, at the next election, his constituents forsook him. Buss, now, more than ever, turned his face toward Austria. During the Austro-Italian War he was active at the head of an association for the relief of the German prisoners; in acknowledgment of his services the emperor conferred on him the Order of the Iron Crown. He also organized at Vienna a great manifestation in favor of the temporal power of the pope, for which he was decorated by Pope Pius IX with the Order of Gregory the Great.
Under the strain of work and disappointments, Buss broke down completely in 1866. He recovered, but events had meanwhile advanced rapidly and his hopes for the hegemony of Austria were blasted. He remained averse to the new German Empire. Elected a fourth time to the Lower House of Baden, Buss maintained his former reputation. In 1874 he was sent to the Reichstag by a very large vote and took his seat with the Centre Party. In 1877, after the death of his youngest child, he withdrew from public life and died soon after.
Works.
The "Methodology of Canon Law" (1842), the "Influence of Christianity on Law and State" (1844), the "Difference between Catholic and Protestant Universities in Germany" (1846), the "German Union and the Love of Prussia", the "Re-establishment of Canon Law", and the "Defence of the Jesuits" (1853) appeared in rapid succession, each to do the work of the hour. The 1855 "Life of St. Thomas of Canterbury" was dedicated it to Archbishop Vicari.

Jimmy Goodfellow

James "Jimmy" Goodfellow (born 16 September 1943) is an English former professional footballer and manager. A midfielder, he scored 33 goals in 479 league goals in a 13-year career in the Football League.
He spent his youth with Newcastle United, but did not earn a professional contract. Instead he played amateur football with Consett, Crook Town, and Bishop Auckland; he won the FA Amateur Cup with Crook Town in 1962. He entered the Football League with Port Vale in 1966, before transferring to Workington in May 1969. He moved on to Rotherham United four years later, and helped the "Millers" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1974–75. He ended his playing career after spending the 1978–79 season with Stockport County. He then took up coaching with Newport County, Cardiff City, Plymouth Argyle, and Sunderland. He served as Cardiff's manager for six months in 1984, and later spent ten years working behind the scenes at the club.
Playing career.
Goodfellow signed for Newcastle United, despite being a Sunderland fan, but was released by the club at the age of 17 without making a first team appearance. He moved into non-league football, signing for Consett before moving to Northern League side Crook Town. In 1964, at the age of 20, he scored Crook Town's first goal at Wembley when he scored against Enfield in the Amateur Cup final victory. Goodfellow became unhappy with the way the team was selected at Crook Town, being chosen by a committee rather than the club's manager, and agreed to join Bishop Auckland when manager Lawrie McMenemy asked him to do so.
Goodfellow got the call to move into league football at the age of 23, when he was signed to Jackie Mudie's Port Vale. He scored his first goal in the Fourth Division on 1 October 1966, in a 2–2 draw with Barrow at Holker Street. He went on to finish the 1966–67 campaign with seven goals in 28 appearances. Stanley Matthews then took charge at Vale Park, with disastrous consequences; Goodfellow scored twice in 31 games in 1967–68, as the club slipped to 18th place. New boss Gordon Lee then revitalised the club, though after two goals in 36 games in 1968–69, Goodfellow joined Workington on a free transfer in May 1969.
The "Reds" finished just one place and one point above the re-election zone in 1969–70, before rising up to tenth place in 1970–71. New boss George Aitken then led the club to sixth and 13th place finishes in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 campaigns. Goodfellow scored 15 goals in 199 Fourth Division appearances in his time at Borough Park.
He signed for Rotherham United in 1973. A highly consistent player, his one weakness was his lack of goals. Jimmy McGuigan's "Millers" finished 15th in 1973–74, before winning promotion with a third-place finish in 1974–75. They adjusted well to the Third Division, posting a 16th place finish in 1975–76, before missing out on promotion due to a slightly inferior goal difference to Crystal Palace in 1976–77. Rotherham then dropped to just one position and three points above the relegation zone in 1977–78. Goodfellow scored eight goals in 192 league games during his time at Millmoor.
He ended his playing career with Stockport County at the end of the 1978–79 season. He made just three Fourth Division appearances for Mike Summerbee's "Hatters", before departing Edgeley Park.
Managerial career.
Goodfellow asked by Len Ashurst to join him as his assistant manager at Newport County. He would later follow Ashurst to Cardiff City, and helped Ashurst to lead Cardiff to promotion into the Second Division in 1982–83. Ashurst would leave in March 1984 to take over at Sunderland, his hometown club. Goodfellow was appointed joint caretaker manager of the club, alongside senior player Jimmy Mullen. At the end of the season he was named as the club's permanent manager, with Mullen as his assistant. However, Goodfellow had a poor start to his tenure as City manager, losing eight of the first nine games of the 1984–85 season, and was sacked after just over two months in charge and replaced by Alan Durban. After his dismissal he joined Plymouth Argyle as physio, before joining up with Lawrie McMenemy again for an ill-fated spell at Sunderland.
Two years after leaving Ninian Park, he was asked to return to Cardiff as the club's physio and coach by then manager Frank Burrows. Goodfellow would go on to serve the "Bluebirds" with distinction under a series of managers, and in 1998 he was given a testimonial by the club against Manchester United, with Goodfellow himself being brought on in the final few minutes, at the age of 55.

Hernán Alessandri Rodríguez, (May 21, 1900 - March 27, 1982). Was a renowned Chilean medical educator and the son of Arturo Alessandri, who was president from 1920 to 1925 and again from 1932 to 1938, and brother of Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez, who was president from 1958 to 1962.
Early life.
Alessandri was born in Santiago, the son of Arturo Alessandri Palma and of Rosa Ester Rodríguez. He completed his early studies at the Instituto Nacional, and later received his medical degree from the Universidad de Chile in 1923.
Public life.
When in 1927 his father was sent into exile, he used the opportunity to deepen his medical knowledge in France and Germany. At the University of Chile, he became successively Professor of Clinical Medicine (1932), of Medical Semiology (1937), and Full Professor and Chair of Medicine (1944). At the "Hospital del Salvador" in Santiago, he organized a Clinical Department exemplary for its discipline, academic environment and dedication to patients and students.
He was one of the prime movers for the reform of medical teaching in 1943, created the medical residency programs for the training of specialists in 1952, served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1958 to 1962, and was a founding member of the Chilean Academy of Medicine (1964). 
He was the first Latin American to be named Honorary Member of the American College of Physicians (1968) and became Emeritus Professor of the University of Chile in 1973. He died in Santiago, in 1982. 
His disciples and friends established in his honor a social and teaching foundation which they named after him.

<doc id="19216612" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19216612" title="Asymptotology">
Asymptotology

Asymptotology has been defined as “the art of dealing with applied mathematical systems in limiting cases” as well as “the science about the synthesis of simplicity and exactness by means of localization.
Principles.
The field of asymptotics is normally first encountered in school geometry with the introduction of the asymptote, a line to which a curve tends at infinity. The word Ασύμπτωτος (asymptotos) in Greek means non-coincident and puts strong emphasis on the point that approximation does not turn into coincidence. It is a salient feature of asymptotics, but this property alone does not entirely cover the idea of asymptotics and, etymologically, the term seems to be quite insufficient.
Perturbation theory, small and large parameters.
In physics and other fields of science, one frequently comes across problems of an asymptotic nature, such as damping, orbiting, stabilization of a perturbed motion, etc. Their solutions lend themselves to asymptotic analysis (perturbation theory), which is widely used in modern applied mathematics, mechanics and physics. But asymptotic methods put a claim on being more than a part of classical mathematics. K. Friedrichs said: “Asymptotic description is not only a convenient tool in the mathematical analysis of nature, it has some more fundamental significance”. M. Kruskal introduced the special term asymptotology, defined above, and called for a formalization of the accumulated experience to convert the art of asymptotology to a science. 
 A general term is capable of possessing significant heuristic value. In his essay The Future of Mathematics, H. Poincaré wrote: 
"The invention of a new word will often be sufficient to bring out the relation, and the word will be creative... It is hardly possible to believe what economy of thought, as Mach used to say, can be effected by a well-chosen term... Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things... When language has been well chosen, one is astonished to find that all demonstrations made for a known object apply immediately to many new objects: nothing requires to be changed, not even the terms, since the names have become the same... The bare fact, then, has sometimes no great interest: ... it only acquires a value when some more careful thinker perceives the connection it brings out, and symbolizes it by a term." 
Problems of asymptotic nature, such as damping, orbiting, stabilization of a perturbed motion, are encountered in physics and other fields. Asymptotic analysis (perturbation theory) is widely used in the modern applied mathematics, mechanics and physics. But asymptotic methods put a claim on being more than a part of classical mathematics; K.Friedrichs said: “Asymptotic description is not only a convenient tool in the mathematical analysis of nature, it has some more fundamental significance”. M.Kruskal introduced a special term “asymptotology” and defined it as an art of handling applied mathematical systems in limiting cases. He called for a formalization of the accumulated experience to convert the art of asymptotology to science.
In addition, “the success of ‘cybernetics’, ‘attractors’ and ‘catastrophe theory’ illustrates the fruitfulness of word creation as scientific research”.
Almost every physical theory, formulated in the most general manner, is rather difficult from a mathematical point of view. Therefore both at the genesis of the theory and its further development, the simplest limiting cases, which allow analytical solutions, are of particular importance. In those limits, the number of equations usually decreases, their order reduces, nonlinear equations can be replaced by linear ones, the initial system becomes averaged in a certain sense, and so on. 
All these idealizations, different as they may seem, increase the degree of symmetry of the mathematical model of the phenomenon under consideration.
Asymptotic approach.
In essence, the asymptotic approach to a complex problem consists in treating the insufficiently symmetrical governing system as close to a certain symmetrical one as possible.
In attempting to obtain a better approximation of the exact solution to the given problem, it is crucial that the determination of corrective solutions, which depart from the limit case, be much simpler than directly investigating the governing system. At first sight, the possibilities of such an approach seem restricted to varying the parameters determining the system only within a narrow range. However, experience in the investigation of different physical problems shows that if the system’s parameters have changed sufficiently and the system has deviated far from the symmetrical limit case, another limit system, often with less obvious symmetries can be found, to which an asymptotic analysis is also applicable. This allows one to describe the system’s behavior on the basis of a small number of limit cases over the whole range of parameter variations. Such an approach corresponds to the maximum level of intuition, promotes further insights, and eventually leads to the formulation of new physical concepts. It is also important that asymptotic methods help to establish the connection between different physical theories.
The aim of the asymptotic approach is to simplify the object. This simplification is attained by decreasing the vicinity of the singularity under consideration. It is typical that the accuracy of asymptotic expansions grows with localization. Exactness and simplicity are commonly regarded as mutually exclusive notions. When tending to simplicity, we sacrifice exactness, and trying to achieve exactness, we expect no simplicity. Under localization, however, the antipodes converge; the contradiction is resolved in a synthesis called asymptotics. In other words, simplicity and exactness are coupled by an “uncertainty principle” relation while the domain size serves as a small parameter - a measure of uncertainty.
Asymptotic uncertainty principle.
Let us illustrate the “asymptotic uncertainty principle”. Take the expansion of the function formula_1 in an asymptotic sequence formula_2: 
formula_3, formula_4 → formula_5.
A partial sum of the series is designated by formula_6, and the exactness of approximation at a given formula_7 is estimated by formula_8. Simplicity is characterized here by the number formula_7 and the locality by the length of interval formula_4.
Based on known properties of the asymptotic expansion, we consider the pair wise interrelation of values formula_4, formula_7, and formula_13. At a fixed formula_4 the expansion initially converges, i.e., the exactness increases at the cost of simplicity. If we fix formula_7, the exactness and the interval size begin to compete. The smaller the interval, the given value of formula_13 is reached more simply.
We illustrate these regularities using a simple example. Consider the integral exponential function: 
formula_17.
Integrating by parts, we obtain the following asymptotic expansion 
formula_18, formula_19 → formula_20.
Put formula_21, formula_22. Calculating the partial sums of this series and the values formula_23 and formula_1 for different formula_4 yields:
Thus, at a given formula_4, the exactness first increases with the growth of formula_7 and then decreases (so one has an asymptotic expansion). For a given formula_7, one may observe an improvement of exactness with diminishing formula_4.
Finally, is it worth using asymptotic methods if computers and numerical procedures have reached such an advanced state? As D.G. Crighton has mentioned,
"Design of computational or experimental schemes without the guidance of asymptotic information is wasteful at best, dangerous at worst, because of the possible failure to identify crucial (stiff) features of the process and their localization in coordinate and parameter space. Moreover, all experience suggests that asymptotic solutions are useful numerically far beyond their nominal range of validity, and can often be used directly, at least at a preliminary product design stage, for example, saving the need for accurate computation until the final design stage where many variables have been restricted to narrow ranges."
So, had he lived now, Galileo would have said: "The book of Nature is written in the language of asymptotology".

RAF Angle

Royal Air Force station Angle or more simply RAF Angle is a former Royal Air Force station located south east of Dale, Pembrokeshire and west of Pembroke, Pembrokeshire, Wales.
It was opened on 1 December 1941 and closed in the 1950s after being used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy.
History.
It was initially used by No. 32 Squadron RAF flying the Hawker Hurricane I. In November 1941 they were replaced by 615 Squadron, and the Hurricane IIC. Several Squadrons followed: 312 Squadron flew the Supermarine Spitfire VB and 263 Squadron with the Westland Whirlwind.
Next No. 152 Squadron RAF, No. 412 Squadron RCAF and No. 421 Squadron RCAF squadrons occupied the base, flying the Spitfire VB.
During May 1943 794 Naval Air Squadron were posted here conducting target towing and the control of the airfield was transferred to the Royal Navy with the site being renamed RNAS Angle (HMS Goldcrest). However in September 1943 the Royal Navy moved from RNAS Angle to the RNAS Dale, and the RAF swapped sites in the other direction with the Coastal Command Development Unit moving in.
The airfield was used as the base for trials of the prototype Highball bouncing bomb on 6 October 1943 using a tunnel at Maenclochog as a target. Highball was a spherical design with dimples by Barnes Wallis and were dropped by de Havilland Mosquito aircraft.
Other units based at Angle were:
Between 1945 and the 1950s Angle was used as a Relief Landing Ground for Fleet Air Arm aircraft based at RNAS Brawdy.
Current use.
The site is currently used for farming and only a few huts and the perimeter track are left.

TS Playfair

TS "Playfair" is a traditionally-rigged brigantine training ship operated by Toronto Brigantine Inc., a sail-training Canadian registered charity based in Toronto, Canada. "Playfair", along with her sister ship , operate a youth sail training program on the Great Lakes during the summer months. This program is one of the very few sail training programs where all of the crew except for the captain are in high school (13–19 years old). The summer training is followed by a winter program where youth work through higher levels of training syllabus to become accredited members of the crew the following year.
History.
"Playfair" was constructed for Toronto Brigantine Inc. in 1973 as an addition to an already established sail training organization. She was commissioned by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1974, and remains the only Canadian ship to be commissioned by a reigning monarch. Although very similar to sister ships "Pathfinder" and "St. Lawrence II", there are several minor structural differences such as a wider transom and a slightly larger freeboard. Since 1974 "Playfair" has conducted sail training on the Great Lakes with occasional summer voyages down the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic, most recently in 2007 for Tall Ships Halifax.
Interior layout.
"Playfair" is divided into six watertight compartments from fore to aft the: Forepeak (general bosun stores, anchor chain bins); Petty Officer's Mess (sleeping space for 4 petty officers); Seamen's Mess (sleeping and living space for up to 18 trainees, also includes the galley); Engine Room (area for engine, generator and batteries); Wardroom (sleeping and living space for 6 wardroom officers, also includes the captains cabin, a separate but not watertight compartment) and the Afterpeak (mooring line and fender storage and steering gear).

The Quatermass Experiment (2005 TV film)

The Quatermass Experiment was a 2005 live remake of the 1953 TV series of the same name by Nigel Kneale.
Plot.
A contemporary adaptation of Nigel Kneale's seminal 1953 science fiction serial.
Casting.
Actor Jason Flemyng was cast as Quatermass, with long-time Kneale admirer Mark Gatiss as Paterson, Andrew Tiernan as Carroon, Indira Varma as his wife Judith, David Tennant as Briscoe, Adrian Bower as Fullalove and Adrian Dunbar as Lomax—now a Ministry of Defence official rather than a policeman. Isla Blair was cast as Home Secretary Margaret Blaker, a combination of parts of Lomax's character and two officials from the original serial, and she brought to rehearsals a photograph of her husband Julian Glover on the set of the 1967 film version of "Quatermass and the Pit". Blair stated that she was delighted to be joining "the Quatermass club".
Original 1953 cast member Moray Watson—who had played Marsh, one of Quatermass's colleagues—visited the set during rehearsals. The 76-year-old was invited to make a cameo appearance in the live broadcast, but was not available that evening. It was during the rehearsals for "The Quatermass Experiment" that David Tennant was offered the role of the Tenth Doctor in "Doctor Who". This casting was not announced to the public until later in April, but his fellow castmembers, and crew, became aware of the speculation surrounding Tennant; in the live broadcast Jason Flemyng changed Quatermass's first line to Tennant's Dr Briscoe from "Good to have you back Gordon" to "Good to have you back Doctor" as a deliberate reference.
Production.
The remake was commissioned as part of a "TV on Trial" season being run by BBC Four, examining past television trends and productions. Although it was scheduled in a two-hour slot, the production finished after one hour and forty minutes — underrunning its allotted time, whereas most of the original episodes had overrun. This was expected before transmission, however, after timings had been made at the dress rehearsal, and the increased pace was attributed to the nervousness involved in a live performance.
Adapted from the original scripts by executive producer Richard Fell, the new broadcast was directed by Sam Miller. Kneale acted as a consultant, and Fell and producer Alison Willett had several meetings with the writer at his London home to discuss the script. Science writer and film maker Christopher Riley also acted as an advisor on the project, helping to bring the science references in the script up to date. Although Miller controlled the production's artistic direction, experienced outside broadcast director Trevor Hampton assisted him in controlling the technical aspects of the live production, which was broadcast from the QinetiQ (ex-Ministry of Defence) Longcross Test Track site in Surrey. The story was structurally very close to the original, although set in a slightly distorted version of the present day. The climax was moved from Westminster Abbey to the Tate Modern, as the latter was easier to replicate in studio, and there was no visible monster.
Broadcast and reception.
The production was the BBC's first live made-for-television drama broadcast in over twenty years. The broadcast suffered only a few errors, with some fluffed lines, several on- and off-camera stumbles, background sounds occasionally obscuring the dialogue, and, at the programme's end, a cameraman and sound man appearing in the shot. As the end credits rolled, the cameras showed actors celebrating and congratulating each other; they did not know that they were still on air. However, this could be interpreted as the characters celebrating their survival at the end of their ordeal. On two occasions near the middle of the broadcast a large on-screen graphic was overlaid, advising viewers that a major news story—the death of Pope John Paul II—was being covered on BBC News 24.
Drawing an average audience of 482,000, "The Quatermass Experiment" became BBC Four's fourth-highest-rated programme of all time, behind "The Curse of Steptoe", "The Road to Coronation Street" and "The Alan Clark Diaries". Critic Nancy Banks-Smith in "The Guardian" complimented the production, and noted that "there were minor bumps in this production. One actor dried ... Another made a crashing exit through piles of broken glass left by the monster ... The last scene is still gripping ... I always said Nigel Kneale was a prophet." She also commented that, for Tennant, "This was a useful dummy run for ... Doctor Who, playing a doctor confronted with a man-eating vegetable." In "The Times", Sarah Vine wrote that "The Quatermass Experiment", "despite not always succeeding dramatically, did however serve as a reminder of how a clever story, a good script and some decent acting can be just as effective as millions of pounds worth of special effects". "Texas Monthly" magazine commented it "is an interesting British experience from across the pond...highly gripping and worth a watch." 
Other media.
The production was released on DVD in October 2005 by DD Home Entertainment, with an audio commentary and other extra features. It has also been repeated on BBC Four on several occasions.

Minimally differentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia

Minimally differentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia is a subtype of AML. It is classified as M0 by FAB. It represents 2–3% of all cases of AML. Although minimally differentiated AML was recognized earlier, criteria for FAB M0 were developed in 1991. The blasts in these cases cannot be recognized as myeloid based on morphology and cytochemistry, but immunophenotyping demonstrates myeloid antigens.
Cytochemistry and Molecular Features.
In acute myeloblastic leukemia (M0), the blasts are agranular and nonreactive when stained for myeloperoxidase activity, and Auer rods are not seen. The blasts react with antibodies to myeloperoxidase and antibodies to CD13, CD33, and CD34. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR is positive in most patients. Occasional cases require in situ hybridization to identify the myeloperoxidase gene315 or genomic profiling for early myeloid-associated genes. Abnormal and unfavorable karyotypes (e.g., loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-) and 7q-) and higher expression of the multidrug resistance glycoprotein (p170) are frequent. In general, minimally differentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia has a poor prognosis.

§ 1 Introduction in which Doppler reminds the readers that light is a wave, and that there is debate as to whether it is a transverse wave, with aether particles oscillating perpendicular to the propagation direction. Proponents claim this is necessary to explain polarised light, whereas opponents object to implications for the aether. Doppler doesn't choose sides, although the issue returns in § 6.
§ 2 Doppler observes that colour is a manifestation of the frequency of the light wave, in the eye of the beholder. He describes his principle that a frequency shift occurs when the source or the observer moves. A ship meets waves at a faster rate when sailing against the waves than when sailing along with them. The same goes for sound and light.
§ 3 Doppler derives his equations for the frequency shift, in two cases:
§ 4 Doppler provides imaginary examples of large and small frequency shifts for sound: 
§ 5 Doppler provides imaginary examples of large and small frequency shifts for light from stars. Velocities are expressed in Meilen/s, and the light speed has a rounded value of 42000 Meilen/s. Doppler assumes that 458 THz (extreme red) and 727 THz (extreme violet) are the borders of the visible spectrum, that the spectrum emitted by stars lies exactly between these borders (except for the infrared stars of § 8), and that the colour of the light emitted by stars is white. 
§ 6 Doppler summarises: 
Doppler wishes that his frequency shift theory will soon be tested by another method to determine the radial velocity of stars. He thinks, without reason, that a confirmation of his theory would imply that light is not a transverse but a longitudinal wave.
§ 7 Doppler argues that his theory applies mainly to binary stars. In his opinion the fixed stars are immobile and white. In a binary star high speeds could be possible due to orbital motion, and binaries appear to be colourful. Doppler divides the binaries in two groups: (1) binary stars of unequal brightness; and (2) binary stars of equal brightness. His interpretation is: in case (1) the brighter star is the heavier one, the weaker star revolves around him; in case (2) both stars revolve around a center of mass in the middle, or around a dark third star. In case (2) the colours are usually complementary. Doppler rules out that the rich complementary colours of binaries are contrast illusions, because an astronomer said he had observed that covering one star does not change the colour impression of the other star. Doppler claims that his theory is supported by the fact that for many binary stars the colour indication in Struve's catalogue is different from that in Herschel's older catalogue, attributing the difference to progress of the orbital motion.
§ 8 Doppler presents two groups of variable stars that in his opinion can be explained as binary stars with Doppler effect. These are the "other stars in the heavens" from the title. 
§ 9 Doppler notes that the orbital speed of the Earth (4.7 Meilen/s) is too low (<33 Meilen/s) to result in visually perceptible colour changes. He identifies two factors that may lead to high orbital speeds in a binary star:
Doppler assumes that there are binary stars with a perihelium speed larger than the speed of light. The astronomer Littrow would have suggested that the perihelium speed of the visual binary star γ Virgo is nearly equal to the speed of light.
§ 10 Doppler summarises the above, and concludes that his speculations explain so much that his theory has to be true. He shares a few more speculations:
§ 11 Conclusion: Doppler expects his frequency shift theory will be accepted, because similar aberrations that depend on v/c (Rømer's and Bradley's) have been accepted before. Doppler waits for the experts to decide if his speculations will do as evidence. He is convinced that finally his principle will be used for the determination of the speed of remote stars.

(ε, δ)-definition of limit

In calculus, the (ε, δ)-definition of limit ("epsilon-delta definition of limit") is a formalization of the notion of limit. It was first given by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Augustin-Louis Cauchy never gave an (formula_1) definition of limit in his Cours d'Analyse, but occasionally used formula_1 arguments in proofs. The definitive modern statement was ultimately provided by Karl Weierstrass.
History.
Isaac Newton was aware, in the context of the derivative concept, that the limit of the ratio of evanescent quantities was "not" itself a ratio, as when he wrote:
Occasionally Newton explained limits in terms similar to the epsilon-delta definition. Augustin-Louis Cauchy gave a definition of limit in terms of a more primitive notion he called a "variable quantity". He never gave an epsilon-delta definition of limit (Grabiner 1981). Some of Cauchy's proofs contain indications of the epsilon, delta method. Whether or not his foundational approach can be considered a harbinger of Weierstrass's is a subject of scholarly dispute. Grabiner feels that it is, while Schubring (2005) disagrees.
Informal statement.
Let "f" be a function. To say that
means that "f"("x") can be made as close as desired to "L" by making the independent variable "x" close enough, but not equal, to the value "c".
How close is "close enough to "c"" depends on how close one wants to make "f"("x") to "L". It also of course depends on which function "f" is and on which number "c" is. Therefore let the positive number "ε" (epsilon) be how close one wishes to make "f"("x") to "L"; strictly one wants the distance to be less than "ε". Further, if the positive number "δ" is how close one will make "x" to "c", and if the distance from "x" to "c" is less than "δ" (but not zero), then the distance from "f"("x") to "L" will be less than "ε". Therefore "δ" depends on "ε". The limit statement means that no matter how small "ε" is made, "δ" can be made small enough.
The letters "ε" and "δ" can be understood as "error" and "distance", and in fact Cauchy used "ε" as an abbreviation for "error" in some of his work. In these terms, the error ("ε") in the measurement of the value at the limit can be made as small as desired by reducing the distance ("δ") to the limit point.
This definition also works for functions with more than one input value. In those cases, "δ" can be understood as the radius of a circle or sphere or higher-dimensional analogy, in the domain of the function and centered at the point where the existence of a limit is being proven, for which every point inside produces a function value less than "ε" away from the value of the function at the limit point.
Precise statement.
The formula_4 definition of the limit of a function is as follows:
Let formula_5 be a function defined on an open interval containing formula_6 (except possibly at formula_6) and let formula_8 be a real number. Then we may make the statement
if and only if:
or, symbolically,
All that the statement
means is that formula_10 is within formula_11 units of formula_6, since all it really states is that the magnitude of the difference between formula_10 and formula_6 is greater than formula_23 and no more than formula_11. In this sense the condition term of the requirements for a limit to exist first asserts that an arbitrary formula_11 should be picked, and then the range of surrounding formula_10 values calculated. In exactly the same manner, the conclusion, that 
in plain English reduces to that formula_5 must remain within formula_14 units of formula_8. In other words, in order for the limit to exist, one must be able to pick a small formula_10 window around formula_6, and deduce that the value of the function formula_5 must remain bounded within a certain calculable range.
Worked Example.
Let us prove the statement that 
This is easily shown through graphical understandings of the limit, and as such serves as a strong basis for introduction to proof. According to the formal definition above, a limit statement is correct if and only if confining formula_10 to formula_11 units of formula_6 will inevitably confine formula_5 to formula_14 units of formula_8. In this specific case, this means that the statement is true if and only if confining formula_10 to formula_11 units of 5 will inevitably confine 
to formula_14 units of 12. The overall key to showing this implication is to demonstrate how formula_11 and formula_14 must be related to each other such that the implication holds. Mathematically, we want to show that
Simplifying, factoring, and dividing 3 on the right hand side of the implication yields
which immediately gives the required result if we choose 
Thus the proof is completed. Though it may seem unnecessary, the key to the proof lies in the ability of one to choose boundaries in formula_10, and then conclude corresponding boundaries in formula_5, which in this case were related by a factor of 3, which in retrospect is entirely due to the slope of 3 in the line 
Continuity.
A function "f" is said to be continuous at "c" if it is both defined at "c" and its value at "c" equals the limit of "f" as "x" approaches "c":
If the condition 0 < |"x" − "c"| is left out of the definition of limit, then requiring "f"("x") to have a limit at "c" would be the same as requiring "f"("x") to be continuous at "c".
"f" is said to be continuous on an interval "I" if it is continuous at every point "c" of "I".
Comparison with infinitesimal definition.
Keisler proved that a hyperreal definition of limit reduces the quantifier complexity by two quantifiers. Namely, formula_5 converges to a limit "L" as formula_10 tends to "a" if and only if for every infinitesimal "e", the value formula_56 is infinitely close to "L"; see microcontinuity for a related definition of continuity, essentially due to Cauchy. Infinitesimal calculus textbooks based on Robinson's approach provide definitions of continuity, derivative, and integral at standard points in terms of infinitesimals. Once notions such as continuity have been thoroughly explained via the approach using microcontinuity, the epsilon, delta approach is presented, as well. Hrbacek argues that the definitions of continuity, derivative, and integration in Robinson-style non-standard analysis must be grounded in the ε-δ method in order to cover also non-standard values of the input Błaszczyk et al. argue that microcontinuity is useful in developing a transparent definition of uniform continuity, and characterize the criticism by Hrbacek as a "dubious lament". Hrbacek proposes an alternative nonstandard analysis, which unlike Robinson's has many "levels" of infinitesimals, so that limits at one level can be defined in terms of infinitesimals at the next level.

Ballana

Ballana was a cemetery in Lower Nubia. It was excavated by Walter Bryan Emery between 1928 and 1931 as a rescue project before the construction of a high dam at Aswan. A total of 122 tombs were found under huge artificial mounds. They date to the time after the collapse of the Meroitic state but before the founding of the Christian Nubian kingdoms, around AD 350 to 600. They usually featured one or several underground chambers, with one main burial chamber. Some tombs were found unlooted, but even the robbed burials still proved to contain many burial goods.
The objects found are chiefly of Nubian origin, but there were also many objects imported from Byzantine Egypt and the Mediterranean in general. Most remarkable is a set of crowns from different tombs showing that the richest burials belong to local ruling kings and queens. There were horses and servants buried with their masters. There are few written objects in the burials. The identification of the tomb owners is, therefore, impossible. It has been assumed that these are the burials of the kings and the court of Nobatia. 
One important tomb discovered here was tomb 118 which consisted of three chambers. It might be described as an example of a royal burial at Ballana and consisted of a main burial chamber and two storage rooms. The roof of the burial chamber had collapsed and the tomb, therefore, escaped looting. The body of the person buried here was found on a bier. It was most likely that of a king. Upon his head was found a crown. Under the bier, were the remains of a large wooden gaming board, weapons and an iron folding chair. There were also skeletons of a young male servant and a cow. In the two storerooms, more skeletons of servants, as well as pottery and several bronze lamps were discovered.
The Ballana tombs belong to a culture complex often called X-Group. Following the find of these tombs, this culture is most often called Ballana Culture. The original Ballana cemetery is now flooded by the Nasser Lake.

Metapsychology

Metapsychology (Greek: "meta" 'beyond, transcending', and "ψυχολογία" 'psychology') is a speculative psychology which seeks to understand the structure of the mind in terms which may not be empirically verifiable. 
Metapsychology is also used to refer to a theoretically explicit psychology, as well as to one that seeks to unify mind and body in a person-centered context.
Freud.
Psychoanalytic metapsychology is concerned with the fundamental assumptions of the Freudian theory. Freud originally used the term in his correspondence with Wilhelm Fliess, to refer to his addition of unconscious processes to the conscious ones of traditional psychology: “I would ask you seriously whether I may use the term metapsychology for my psychology which takes one beyond consciousness". 
Subsequently he came to use it to cover a comprehensive description of any mental process - one comprising dynamic forces, quantitative relations and structural elements in the human mind.
In the 1910s, he began writing a series of 12 essays, to be collected as "Preliminaries to a Metapsychology". While five were published independently, the remaining seven remained unpublished, Freud replying to Lou Andreas-Salome in 1919 as follows: “Where is my Metapsychology? In the first place it remains unwritten”.
Some of Freud's followers, like George S. Klein, came to privilege his clinical thinking over his metapsychology.
Gerbode.
The modern metapsychology movement was founded by psychiatrist Frank A. Gerbode, and stresses therapy as a way of developing the spirit for personal growth, rather than as an answer to mental disorders.

Netafim Border Crossing

The Netafim Crossing () is a border crossing between Israel and Egypt. It is located adjacent to Highway 12, about 12 km north of Eilat, 1 km north west of Ein Netafim.
The control of the border crossing was handed over to the Israel Airports Authority in 1980; nowadays it is closed. Very seldom it is reopened under special circumstances.
There are plans to reopen the border crossing passage as alternative during festivals, in coordination with the Egyptian authorities.
The border line is guarded accurately on both sides, on the Israeli side alongside Highway 12 (one of the two accommodation roads to Eilat) by the Israel Border Police and on the Egyptian side from some army positions.
The border crossing is in the proximity of the Israel National Trail, but not exactly on the route, nevertheless many wanderers, who have lost their way, arrive at the border crossing to drink something.
History.
In the last day of Operation Ovda, March 10, 1949, the Negev Brigade captured the abandoned position of the Jordanian Legion in Ras al-Naqb (hebr. ראס אל-נקב) exactly where the border crossing Netafim is located today.
As well during the Suez Crisis in 1956, Ras al-Naqb was one of the important strategic positions to gain control of the Sinai Peninsula.

If I Were a Boy

"If I Were a Boy" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé Knowles for her third studio album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" (2008). It was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad, who also handled its production alongside Knowles. Inspired by the difficult break-up of a romantic relationship, the song was initially recorded by Jean, whose record company rejected it. Knowles then recorded her own version. Jean was upset when she learned that Knowles was releasing it as a single, but eventually they reached an agreement. "If I Were a Boy" was released by Columbia Records on October 12, 2008, as the album's lead single alongside "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". The two songs showcased the contrast between Knowles' personality and her aggressive onstage persona, Sasha Fierce. A Spanish version of the song, titled "Si Yo Fuera un Chico", was digitally released in Mexico and Spain.
"If I Were a Boy" is a pop introspective ballad which draws influences from folk rock through its instrumentation of which includes acoustic guitars, drums and strings. The song's lyrics lament the misunderstandings between the genders and indict the male side of relationships. "If I Were a Boy" was generally well received by critics, who complimented Knowles' tormented and emotive vocal performance and called the song her best work to date. The single was a commercial success as it placed in the top ten on twenty-five different singles charts. It topped the charts in more than eight European countries, including the United Kingdom, where it is Knowles' best-selling single. "If I Were a Boy" peaked at number three on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and earned multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, and the US.
The accompanying music video for "If I Were a Boy" was directed by Jake Nava and shot in black-and-white. With a theme of role reversal, it is conceptually similar to the American comedy film "Freaky Friday" (1976). A video for the Spanish version of the ballad was edited from the original clip. Knowles promoted "If I Were a Boy" through live performances at venues including "The Oprah Winfrey Show", the 52nd Grammy Awards, and the I Am... World Tour (2009–10). The song has been covered several times on televised music competitions. American singer Reba McEntire sang a country version of the ballad on Country Music Television (CMT), and a studio version was released as the second single from her 2010 album, "All the Women I Am".
Writing and production.
"If I Were a Boy" was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad; it is the opening ballad of the "I Am ..." disc of the double album "I Am... Sasha Fierce". It is the only song on either disc that Knowles did not co-write. Most of the lyrics were written by Jean, who was inspired by the break-up of a romantic relationship. One day Jean and Gad visited a pizzeria in Times Square in New York City. Although tempted, Jean refrained from eating pizza because she was dieting. She then thought that if she were a boy, she would have eaten without regret. After reflecting on the idea, she concluded that she would have been a better man than her past lover. Gad captured Jean's ideas on a pocket recorder, and they went to the studio the same day. Once there, she wrote the lyrics and melody in about 15 minutes. She then recorded the song in less than half an hour, with Gad on the guitar.
After completing her version of "If I Were a Boy", Jean presented it to her record company, which rejected the song. Gad and Jean had co-written 12 songs, including "If I Were a Boy", for the singer's debut album. As the deal with Jean's record company fell apart, Gad marketed the songs to established artists. Knowles liked "If I Were a Boy" and recorded her own version of it for her album "I Am... Sasha Fierce". Gad and Knowles produced the track in 2008 at Roc the Mic Studios and Strawberry Productions in New York City and at GAD Studios in Ibiza. Gad did the musical arrangements, assisted in recording the music, and played the instruments alongside his brother Jens Gad and Reggie Syience Perry. Jim Caruana recorded Knowles' vocals at Roc the Mic Studios. Mark "Spike" Stent mixed the track with assistance from Matt Green at The Record Plant in Los Angeles. "If I Were a Boy" was placed on the "I Am..." disc of "I Am... Sasha Fierce", as it is a ballad that shows Knowles' insecurities about love and the person she is "underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama".
In an interview with "Essence" magazine, Knowles explained that "If I Were a Boy" is "broad" and different from her previous releases because it is not a traditional R&B song. She added, "I had to try it, because I remember Aretha Franklin said a great singer can sing anything and make it her own." Knowles was also motivated by her audience's strong expectations from her as a singer. While preparing her third solo album, Knowles wanted to experiment with stronger lyrics and record ballads like "If I Were a Boy" because, "the music and the emotion in the story is told so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say."
Jean's response.
After Jean's version of "If I Were a Boy" was rejected by her record company, she was upset that Knowles recorded and released the ballad. Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that Jean was first informed that Knowles recorded the song by a stranger. "The Daily Telegraph" reported that Knowles' father and then-manager Mathew Knowles pursued the publishing rights of "If I Were a Boy" after realizing that it had the potential to become a big hit. Jean used her Myspace account to express her frustration: "I have been reading some of these comments and to set the record straight from the horse's mouth – IF I WERE A BOY is my song; YES, I wrote this song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is very dear to me. You can hear the original version on my myspace site." Friedman later reported that Knowles and Jean had come to terms. The deal included a promise that Knowles would record a duet with Jean for her debut album.
In an interview with Eric R. Danton of "Hartford Courant", Jean was asked about her reaction when she heard that Knowles was recording "If I Were a Boy". She was initially surprised when people regarded her as a songwriter because she envisioned herself as "do the whole artist thing as well". Jean added, "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's going to be on my album!' And it can be on my album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked ... At first when I got this, people didn't know that I was an artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.' " "If I Were a Boy" was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially did not intend to hand it to another singer. Jean said that the fact that Knowles recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics. She refused their offers, desiring to use her songs for her own album. However, Jean still intends to write for other artists.
Composition and lyrical interpretation.
"If I Were a Boy" is a midtempo pop ballad with folk rock and soft rock influences. The song was composed using common time in the key of G major and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It was written in the common verse-chorus form; the verses are supported by four chords and follow a vi-IV-I-V chord progression in the form Em7–C–G–D/F. Ed Masle of "The Arizona Republic" noted that the progression is reminiscent of Nirvana's 1991 song "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Instrumentation is provided by a piano, acoustic guitars, live drums, and strings as well as hand claps which are used throughout the song. Knowles' vocals span the range from a low of G♯3 to the high of E5. Her singing gets higher and louder as she employs melodic crescendos. Critics noted that Knowles delivers a tormented performance with unwavering sentiments.
The lyrics of "If I Were a Boy" are about a gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Knowles analyses the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do if she were a boy, Knowles highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During the first part of the ballad, Knowles alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Knowles then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".
In the second verse, Knowles resigns herself and continues to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating the man who has wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Knowles continues, "I'd put myself first / And make the rules as I go / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' for me to come home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Knowles stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly. As Knowles emphasizes how it feels to be cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did in the rest of the song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Knowles concludes, "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she " her voice into a thin, pleading whine" at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony bring her down.
Release.
"If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" were released simultaneously as the double album's two lead singles. The songs were taken from different discs of the album to demonstrate Knowles' conflicting personalities, the album's central theme. This motif was demonstrated by placing the ballads on a separate disc from the uptempo tracks. "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies" were initially planned to debut on US radio stations on October 7, 2008, but both premiered the following day. "If I Were a Boy" debuted on Z100's "Elvis Duran and the Morning Show", while "Single Ladies" first aired on New York mainstream urban radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio on October 13, 2008. That same day, "If I Were a Boy" was sent to contemporary hit radio, and "Single Ladies was sent to urban contemporary radio. On November 24, 2008, "If I Were a Boy" was sent to US urban radio. Two digital EPs, each containing seven dance remixes of "If I Were a Boy" were released on February 10, 2009 in the US.
The ballad was first released internationally as a stand-alone digital download in Oceania and most European countries on October 17, 2008. In France and the United Kingdom, "If I Were a Boy" was serviced digitally on October 26, 2008. On November 7, 2008, a two-track CD single, including "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" as the B-side, went on sale in all European countries, Oceania, and in Canada. In Canada two different digital EPs were made available on February 3 and 10, 2009. A Spanish version of "If I Were a Boy" was translated by Rudy Pérez and mixed by Andrés Bermúdez at The Beach House in Miami. Titled "Si Yo Fuera un Chico (If I Were a Boy)", this version was only included on copies of "I Am... Sasha Fierce" in Mexico as well as iTunes Stores in Latin America and Spain, where it was released as a stand-alone single on February 3, 2009.
Critical reception.
"If I Were a Boy" received general acclaim from contemporary music critics, who applauded Knowles' vocal performance and called the song her best yet. "Billboard" magazine's critic Chuck Taylor wrote that "If I Were a Boy" is Knowles' "most affecting offering" since "Listen" (2006). He praised her vocals as "breathtaking, exquisitely emotive, mournful, and mature" and added that the song "exudes the fragrance of a Grammy Award". According to Ann Powers of "Los Angeles Times", "If I Were a Boy" is Knowles' Streisand moment and "a tender, fairly simple ballad that uses to prove she's a great vocal actress". Powers concluded, "This isn't just another breakup song; it's an elegy for female empowerment, Beyoncé's admission that no amount of money, fame or skill can solve the basic inequity between her man's heart and her own." Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that "If I Were a Boy" could become as commercially successful as "Irreplaceable" because of its radio-friendly appeal. James Montgomery of MTV News complimented the "tear-jerking power" of "If I Were a Boy" and noted that it reveals "sides of Beyoncé we never knew existed".
Matos Michaelangelo of "The A.V. Club" remarked that "If I Were a Boy" has "boilerplate lyrics" that would fit perfectly in mature roles that English actress Hayley Mills played in the 1960s. Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote in his review of the album that "If I Were a Boy" has the "most interesting lyrics" of the entire record. In a separate review of "If I Were a Boy", Levine awarded it four stars out of five, writing that Knowles' vocals on the song are passionate. He praised the lyrics for not being overwritten and commended their "emotional punch" and "very strong melody" which he said can make people feel that they have always known the song. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called "If I Were a Boy" an "effective and affecting gender-bender". Allmusic writer Andy Kellman felt that though the ballad sounds like "the watery backdrop for a singing competition finale", it is the most outstanding song on "I Am... Sasha Fierce" thanks to its lyrics and Knowles' tormented performance. Colin McGuire of PopMatters felt that "If I Were a Boy" was the highlight of the first disc of the double album.
Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" described the song as one of the greatest pop songs of the last few years and one of Knowles' most complicated vocal performances. Joey Guerra of the "Houston Chronicle" commented that "If I Were a Boy" is an "elegant new musical direction" for Knowles and praised it for being different from the songs played on Top 40 radio. By contrast, Stacey Anderson of "Spin" magazine was unimpressed with "If I Were a Boy", calling it a glistening and boring ballad. Adam Mazmanian of "The Washington Times" noted that the musical composition of "If I Were a Boy" has "a spare cinematic quality that [Knowles fills with an expansive voice", which nevertheless falters at times. A 2010 review of "well-intended yet misguided feminist anthems" in "The A.V. Club" noted the song had both a "fresh perspective and a sense of self-awareness" but cast is as "a soppy wallow in whiny self-pity and broad stereotyping".

Music video.
Background and concept.
The music video for "If I Were a Boy" was directed by Jake Nava and was shot in black-and-white in New York City with the video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A Spanish version of the music video, titled "Si Yo Fuera Un Chico", was released with the same concepts as the main one; it was edited from the original with the Spanish version of the song dubbed over it. The music video for "If I Were a Boy" is reflective of the stance as an independent woman that Knowles has taken throughout her career. In an interview with "Billboard" magazine, Knowles revealed that the concept of the video is similar to the American comedy film "Freaky Friday" (1976); its theme is role reversal. She also said that it would depict things that men commonly do to hurt their partners, like not answering their phones, before adding that the video is about little things that mean a lot in relationships. Knowles explained:
In the beginning of the video, my husband makes me breakfast and he's excited about it, and I kind of don't have time to eat. As a police officer, I have a male partner and the video goes through our days. My husband's at work and has attractive girls flirting with him but he declines their advances. I have a guy flirting with me, and I flirt back.
Knowles said that by the end of the video, viewers would realize the husband is a police officer and Knowles, as the female character, has been doing things her husband has done to her. MTV News writer Jennifer Vineyard's analysis of the concept concluded, "When we first saw it from a different perspective, [Knowles'] behavior seemed more abnormal. And when it's the guy doing everything she just did in the previous scenes, it becomes all too familiar—which is Beyoncé's point."
Synopsis.
The video begins with Knowles and her husband saying a few words, including "intimacy", "honesty", and "commitment", and then saying the words "you", "me", and "us" together. When the action starts, Knowles is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Knowles is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making a big deal out of nothing. "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Knowles then asks him in a condescending tone, "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." Then the story reverses, and Knowles starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.
Reception and accolades.
Knowles premiered the video, alongside the video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", on MTV's "Total Request Live" show on October 13, 2008. It was included on Knowles' 2009 remix album with videography, "Above and Beyoncé". Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News described the video as a "meaningful one—and it comes with a twist that requires repeat viewing". She noted that if the video did not exist, she would not have seen the tomboy side of Knowles. A writer for "Rap-Up" commented, "[Beyoncé] delivers one of the year's best videos with the black and white clip." Jennifer Cady of E! Online praised the video, writing that it has a "serious melodramatic storyline". She further noted that it was "slow and everyone overacts, but be sure to catch the end where a major twist will probably change your outlook on the dynamics of male–female relationships forever".
The clip was ranked at number seventy-two on "BET: Notarized Top 100 Videos of 2008" countdown and at number twenty-five on BET J's "Last Call 2008! Top 50 Countdown". It was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2009 BET Awards but lost to Knowles' other video for "Single Ladies". The video also received nominations for Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Japan and for Outstanding Music Video at the 2009 NAACP Image Awards. In July 2009, the video was certified gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for shipping over 5,000 units.
Live performances.
Knowles first performed "If I Were a Boy" on November 6, 2008, at the MTV Europe Music Awards. She later performed the song during the sixth series of the British television show "Strictly Come Dancing" and the 2008 World Music Awards in Monaco on November 9, 2008, which was followed by another performance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" on November 13, 2008. On November 16, 2008, backed by a live band, Knowles sang a medley of "If I Were a Boy", then switched to "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", and concluded with "Crazy in Love" during the final episode of "Total Request Live". The song was sung again on November 26, 2008 during her appearance on The Tyra Banks Show. During this performance, Knowles begins to cry nearing the end of the song. On December 12, 2008, a pre-taped performance aired on the eighth season of the French show "Star Academy" as Knowles could not appear due to busy schedule. During the same day, Knowles performed "If I Were a Boy" on Los Premios 40 Principales in Spain. She also performed the ballad on December 13, 2008, live at the "The X Factor" finale in the UK. Knowles sang a medley of "If I Were a Boy" and Alanis Morissette's 1995 song "You Oughta Know" on January 31, 2010, at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony. She wore a "futuristic, spiked black" outfit with matching shoes, and "pranced, spun and did the Dutty Wine while the crowd cheered in approval", according to Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News. Knowles was also backed by 50 backup dancers dressed as a riot gear. Ben Sisario of "The New York Times" commented that Knowles "was elaborately staged and typically athletic" during the performance. William Goodman of "Spin" magazine noted that Knowles "owned" the night's most powerful performance. Erika Ramirez of "Billboard" magazine put the performance at number three on her list of "Beyoncé's 5 Biggest TV Performances". Knowles interpolated a verse from "You Oughta Know" into her performance of "If I Were a Boy" at the Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011.
In addition to her performances of the song on television and at award ceremonies, "If I Were a Boy" was included on the set lists of Knowles' I Am... World Tour (2009–10) and I Am... Yours revue. It was subsequently included on her live albums, "I Am... World Tour" and "". Prior to the performance of the song at the tour, outtakes of its music video were used. Knowles later appeared performing "If I Were a Boy" wearing Ray-Bans, a leather breastplate, aviator shades and a bulletproof-looking one-piece further asking the crowd to sing along the track. During the bridge of the song, she included excerpts from Morissette's "You Oughta Know" and Tupac Shakur's "California Love" while imitating a male person with her moves. Alice Jones of "The Independent" wrote in her review that Knowles "whipup a quasi-feminist singalong." Caryn Ganz of "Rolling Stone" noted that the singer channeled her "ferocious onstage persona", Sasha Fierce. Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" compared Knowles' wardrobe and dancing with that of Ciara. In May 2012, Knowles performed "If I Were a Boy" during her revue at Revel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Before Knowles started to sing, she noted that "[everyone knows how it feels to be hurt and lied to". During the performance, she mashed Goo Goo Dolls' "Iris" (1998) and reworked the rhythm of "If I Were a Boy" to fit with the cover. Elysa Gardner of "USA Today" noted that the ballad "became a jangly guitar-pop number" during the show. Kyle Anderson of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that "the most attention-grabbing moments of the night... came when she dipped into other artists' catalogs". In 2013, "If I Were a Boy" was included in the set list of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour where it featured the string motif from The Verve's "Bitter Sweet Symphony" (1997).
Fake tape.
In January 2009, Matthew Zeghibe, a 26-year-old computer art student from Connecticut, used pitch-correction software to make a clip that he claimed was the soundboard recording of "If I Were a Boy" from Knowles' "Today" show appearance in November 2008. In the tape, Knowles sang drastically off-key. A corresponding video was leaked onto the internet, and it went viral. It was even played on American radio stations on April 21, 2009; Howard Stern played the recording, describing it as "the unedited board mix" of Knowles' live performance. According to "Us Weekly", Matthew Knowles was the first to cast doubt on the recording's authenticity, saying that the tape seemed to have been altered. He added that "at 12 years into [Knowles'] career, the last thing someone should be questioning is her vocal ability. That would be like questioning if Kobe Bryant could shoot a jump shot."
On April 22, TMZ.com reported that the tape was a hoax. They revealed that they had spoken to the person who modified the soundboard tapes, and the alleged culprit told them, "It's a little bit crazy. No one in their right mind would sound like that, and no one would cheer for someone singing like that." The following day, Knowles spoke about the allegations to MTV News. She stated that the report was ridiculous and that the timing of the video would draw publicity to two of her upcoming television performances. In an interview with Chris Harris of "Rolling Stone", Zeghibe said that he was surprised by how much attention the clip received and by Knowles' reaction to it. He admitted that he had previously given the same treatment to Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears and that he did not feel he had to apologize for the hoax:
I was just trying to make a point. I wanted to show people how easy it is to manipulate someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.
Cover versions.
Jamaican dancehall singer Althea Hewitt released a reggae cover of "If I Were a Boy" to iTunes Stores on December 19, 2008. Nicole Sullivan and Tisha Campbell-Martin covered "If I Were a Boy" during the episode "The Shape of Things to Come" on the sitcom "Rita Rocks" which aired on October 13, 2009. During the finale of the tenth season of "American Idol" on May 25, 2011, the lady contestants joined together onstage to perform "If I Were a Boy" along with a medley of Knowles' other singles. Caterina Torres covered the song during the second series of "The Voice" (Australia) on May 12, 2013. Torres' version peaked at number 28 on the Australian Singles Chart on May 26, 2013. On June 8, 2013, singer Asanda Jezile covered the song during the final episode of the seventh season of "Britain's Got Talent". 
"Glee" cast member Alex Newell covered the song for the fifth season episode "The End of Twerk". The song was released in iTunes Store on November 11, 2013. Michael Slezak of TVLine praised his rendition of the song as "fantastic" and "flawless". Lauren Hoffman from "Vulture" and Derek Chavis from "The Baltimore Sun" described his rendition as one of the best covers recorded for the series. Marc Snetiker of "Entertainment Weekly" praised the inclusion of the song in the episode and described Newell's vocals as "incredible" while "Billboard"s Rae Votta described the cover as "absolutely stunning".
"The X Factor" performances.
On October 6, 2011, during the first season of "The X Factor US", 13-year-old Rachel Crow covered the song during one of her auditions. She was backed by a piano and went sombre as she sang. Her performance brought judge Nicole Scherzinger to tears. Gil Kaufman of MTV News commented that the cover showed off "her preternaturally powerful growly range". Both Joe Berkowitz of "Rolling Stone" and Jennifer Still of Digital Spy noted that Crow's performance was well executed despite her young age. Sarah Maloy of "Billboard" magazine commented that her performance was "sensational as always". On December 3, 2011, during the eighth series of the British televised music competition "The X Factor", girl band Little Mix covered the "If I Were a Boy". Digital Spy's Daniel Sperling noted that the cover contained "a little Amelia Lily-esque shouting".
On September 26, 2012, during the second season of the "The X Factor" in the United States, Dinah Jane Hansen covered "If I Were a Boy". Annie Barrett of "Entertainment Weekly" praised Hansen's singing, writing that she "stunned the crowd with a vocal so powerful" and "made the song her own". Bruna Nessif of E! Online praised her "powerful" rendition, and Peter Larsen of "The Orange County Register" wrote that she left the judges "speechless, blown away by the power and beauty of her voice". Then, on December 5, 2012, during the same show, Carly Rose Sonenclar also covered the song. Jennifer Still of Digital Spy noted that she sounded "effortless on those long, belting notes and shows a lot of restraint in the verses as well". On August 18, 2013, during the fifth season of "The X Factor Australia", Dami Im covered the song during the home visits round. Lorna Simpson also covered "If I Were a Boy" during the home visits round on the tenth season on "The X Factor" in the UK on October 4, 2013.
On December 4th, 2014 Ellona Santiago covered the song in week 6 of the third season for her Unplugged performance.
Reba McEntire version.
The song was covered by American country singer Reba McEntire on the television program "Unplugged" on Country Music Television. The cover was accompanied by a music video that premiered on June 18, 2010, which depicted McEntire performing the song live. In late 2010, she recorded a studio version, and it was added to country radio on January 24, 2011 by Starstruck Entertainment and Valory Music Group as the second single from her studio album "All the Women I Am" (2010). McEntire revealed that she originally wanted to only cover her own hits. However, her husband and manager, Narvel Blackstock wanted her to do a cover song. Blackstock finally came up with the idea that she should record her own version of Knowles' "If I Were a Boy". Speaking about her version of the song, McEntire said:
"When I got the song and the lyrics, I thought it was an incredible song ... And, to me, it turned out to be a country song, when we got our instrumentation on it and everything. And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' I just think music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side."
McEntire's cover has generally been met with positive reception. Jessica Phillips of "Country Weekly" magazine described her cover as a "soulful countrified look at love from a male perspective". Steve Morse at "The Boston Globe" said that McEntire translated the song "artfully into country". "Bilboard" magazine's Mikael Wood praised the cover, comparing it with McEntire's other cover of Kelly Clarkson's "Because of You". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" noted that McEntire "sounds as if she's already inhabiting the role" in the song. Allmusic critic Thom Jurek was less favorable, writing that it was unrecognizable to the original, before adding, "It contains none of the original's drama; in its place is a failed attempt at a soft rock power ballad." Following McEntire's live performance at the CMA awards, the song debuted at number 60 on the Hot Country Songs charts as an album cut dated for the week ending November 27, 2010. It re-entered at number 60 on the chart dated for the week ending January 29, 2011, and peaked at number 22 in April 2011. It also peaked at number 23 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart in April 2011.
The official music video for the cover premiered on Oprah.com on February 28 at midnight, followed by an exclusive interview. It was directed by Peter Zavadil. After her first performance of the song on "Unplugged" on the Country Music Television, McEntire also performed the song at the Country Music Association (CMA) awards on November 10, 2010. Mawuse Ziegbe of MTV News praised her cover, writing, "Singing with no band onstage, donning a glittery black dress with her signature red hair flowing to her shoulders, the legendary vocalist's performance scored a standing ovation." Jillian Mapes and Megan Vick of "Billboard" praised the performance, writing, "As if Beyonce's 2008 ballad 'If I Were a Boy' wasn't moving enough, country queen Reba McEntire's smokey twang and solemn stance turned the song on its head." They also noted that the simple and powerful performance "is enough to inspire tears, or at least goosebumps." Country Music Television's Chet Flippo felt that McEntire's performance was "the musical highlight of the evening" and added that it was "a lesson of what country music should be striving for these days". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" gave a mixed review of her performance, writing that "did something unexpected, softening her delivery and finding the creases in the song, as if Beyoncé were whispering to her from the wings." However, "Entertainment Weekly"s Mandi Bierly wrote that the lyrics were "just too young for [McEntire, and when it comes to the chorus, I want someone to belt it".

Coja Petrus Uscan

Coja Petrus Uscan (b. 1680/81 – d.1751) was an Armenian merchant and leader of the Armenian community of Madras who was known for his immense wealth and unflinching devotion and loyalty to the British during the French occupation of Madras.
Ancestry and early life.
Petrus Uscan was born in a family of prominent Armenian traders which had traded with the East for generations. His grandfather Coja Pogus (Paul) had been buried in Julfa. Very little is known of his early life except for the fact that he migrated to Madras from Manila in the year 1723 and settled in the city for the rest of his life.
Assumption of monopoly.
As soon as Uscan arrived in Madras, the Nawab of the Carnatic visited Madras and Uscan lavished hospitality upon him. A pleased Nawab offered gifts and titles and sole monopoly of trade in Madras.
Endowments.
Petrus Uscan donated lavishly for Christian religious endowments. He was one of the foremost contributors to the construction of St Rita's church in St Thome. A slab on the east wall of the church has the inscription "In memory of the Armenian nation, 1729". In April, the very same year, the grave of St Thomas was opened for public viewing. Uscan was among those present.
Construction of Marmalong Bridge.
In 1728, Coja Petrus Uscan constructed the Marmalong Bridge across the Adyar River. It cost him 30,000 pagodas. Still, he paid the full amount and also donated 1,500 pagodas for the bridge's upkeep.
The bridge no longer exists today, having been replaced by a second bridge. However, the bridge built by Uscan is the first ever bridge built across the Adyar.
In 1726, he constructed the steps which led to the Catholic shrine atop St Thomas Mount which still bears a slab commemorating Uscan's legacy. He also donated 1,500 pagodas for the maintenance of the steps.
In service of the British East India Company.
As Company Councillor.
Uscan was appointed Company Councillor for the British East India Company. Uscan performed well in his newfound role, occasionally serving as the Company's envoy. In 1740, when the Maratha general Raghuji Bhonsle invaded the Carnatic, Petrus Uscan was appointed the British envoy to negotiate peace with the Maratha general. Uscan negotiated with the Marathas and impressed the general so much that he even recognized British rule over Tiruchirappalli, Madras and Fort St David. On another occasion, Petrus Uscan succeeded in obtaining exclusive rights for the British of Madras to mint coins in their own name.
During French occupation.
When the French occupied Madras in 1746, they seized Petrus Uscan's belongings and carried them off to Pondicherry. Uscan fled Madras and sought refuge in a Danish ship. Dupleix, then the governor of French India, offered him French protection and restoration of confiscated property in the name of the Capuchin chapel of Madras Armenians if Uscan shifted his loyalty to the French. However, Uscan gave a defiant reply that the Armenian tradition was to remain loyal to one's benefactors.
Later life.
When Madras reverted to British control in 1749, Petrus Uscan and one Mrs. Madeiros were the only Catholics permitted to reside in the Fort. Following the reestablishment of British rule over Madras, the Capuchin chapel in the Fort was destroyed by the British who felt that the chief Armenian priest had spied for the French. Petrus managed to retain Armenian hold over the Chapel of Our Lady of Miracles in Vepery for some time. But after his death, it was made over to Protestants and a suitable compensation provided to the Armenian community which previously owned it.
Death.
Petrus Uscan died in 1751 and was buried in the Chapel of Our Lady of Miracles, which he owned. On Protestant occupation of the site in the middle of the 18th century, they built an Anglican church over it. Petrus Uscan's tombstone was however left untouched and it remains to this day.
Legacy.
The Armenian community of Madras gained prominence in the 17th century AD and exercised a significant amount of power and domination over early Madras till the middle of the 19th century. Coja Petrus Uscan who led the Armenian community of Madras from 1723 to 1751 is regarded as the greatest and most famous member of the community. The community has almost become extinct, yet its memory survives through Petrus Uscan's numerous endowments and works of charity.

Paul Troger

Paul Troger (30 October 1698 – 20 July 1762) was an Austrian painter, draughtsman and printmaker of the late Baroque period. Troger's illusionistic ceiling paintings in fresco are notable for their dramatic vitality of movement and their palette of light colors.
Paul Troger’s style, particularly in his frescoes, dominated Austrian painting until the end of the 18th century and profoundly influenced significant artists of the next generation, notably Franz Anton Maulbertsch, Josef Ignaz Mildorfer, Johann Wenzel Bergl.
Life.
Paul Troger was born on 30 October 1698 in Welsberg, in the Puster Valley of the County of Tyrol. At the age of 16, under the patronage of the aristocratic Tyrolean von Firmian family, he visited Fiume and became a pupil of Giuseppe Alberti. He painted his first fresco “Three Angels with the Cross and Putti”, in the Kalvarienkirche, Kaltern (1722).
In 1722, the prince-bishop of Gurk sent Paul Troger to Venice, where he discovered the works of Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. Troger also studied in Rome with Sebastiano Ricci, in Naples with Francesco Solimena and in Bologna, the leading artistic centers of Italy at the time.
On his return to Austria, Troger first worked in Salzburg from 1726 to 1728, where he painted the "Glory of Saint Cajetan" on the ceiling of St. Cajetan’s Church, Salzburg (1728). He afterwards established himself in Vienna, where the art of ceiling frescoes was, however, dominated by Johann Michael Rottmayr and Daniel Gran.
Paul Troger became the favourite fresco painter in Lower Austrian monasteries in collaboration with the architect Josef Munggenast. In 1753, he joined the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. Troger became professor and was made director of the Imperial Academy in 1754. His most prominent student was Franz Anton Maulbertsch. His most important contribution to Austrian painting was to reject the strong dark palette, typical of the beginning of the 18th century, in favor of an increasingly lighter palette, typical of the new Rococo taste.
Works.
Although he did many easel altar paintings and drawings, Paul Troger became famous for his frescoes and much in demand throughout the Austrian lands. Troger's frescoes are remarkable for their immense vitality of movement and their light colors. Noteworthy among them are the following ceiling paintings:

Marsala (ship)

The Marsala Ship is the earliest warship known from archeological evidence. It is a wreck discovered in 1969 in an area called "Punta Scario" in the harbor of Marsala in western Sicily, Italy, near the Aegadian Islands. The Marsala Ship's "nationality" was painted on the sides with letters by its Punic builders from Carthage. 
Ship.
Its architecture and contents show that it was not a merchant cargo ship. A merchant cargo ship made regular journeys and required large containers for storing water. It also needed grinders and mortars for dried food. It would normally carry large pots for communal cooking. It would also have fish-hooks for catching available fresh fish. 
The Marsala Ship had only small cups and bowls for individual servings. Its wine, water, and other liquids were carried in amphorae of miscellaneous shapes. Food remains were fresh and perishable, such as various kinds of butchered meat. Bones of deer, horses, oxen, sheep, goats and pigs were all found. All this indicated it was intended as a warship and not as a merchant cargo vessel. The presence of ballast stones and lack of merchant cargo definitely indicate that it was a warship, probably used for scouting purposes or for ramming smaller boats. The remains of marijuana stems — which may have been chewed by the oarsmen — were also found in the wreck.
It is believed to have been one of the Liburnian "long ships", an oared vessel with 17 sweeps per side used by ancient Carthage in the Battle of the Aegates Islands (241 BC). This was the last battle of the First Punic War between Carthage and the Roman Republic. Carbon-14 tests on timbers and other materials determined a date of 235 BC. 
The vessel was determined to be approximately 115 feet (35 meters) long and 15.7 feet (4.8 meters) wide.
Excavation.
It was in 1969 that a captain of a commercial dredge digging sand for making glass discovered buried wood from ancient vessels in the area of "Punta Scario". In 1971 the movement of a sandbank exposed the "Punic Ship's" stern post with projecting timber. This endangered the shipwreck, threatening the loss of the potential historical value of the information it revealed about the Phoenicians. Rescue excavation began in earnest and continued for the next four years. 
The Sicilian authorities and the British School at Rome appointed Honor Frost to direct the excavation. Frost and her international team of marine archeologists excavated the site. Progress reports were published yearly in the "International Journal of Nautical Archaeology" (London and New York). When the field-work ended, a comprehensive report was published by the 'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (Rome) as a Supplement to "Notizie degli Scavi di Antichità," XXX (1976). 
Some extremely rare finds amongst the shipwreck were a plaited basket, a piece of rope fashioned into a simple eye splice, a little brush, a knife blade, a spade, and a couple of toggles. Also found were parts of a human skeleton, possibly of a Carthaginian sailor trapped by the ship's ballast.
The above pictures of the Marsala ship execavation are from the Regional Archaeological Museum Baglio Anselmi of Marsala in Sicily, Italy.

Darren Kenny

Darren Kenny OBE (born 17 March 1970) is a British road and track racing cyclist and Paralympian. Kenny's results have made him one of his sport's biggest stars.
Career.
Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Kenny now lives in Verwood, Dorset. Having been involved in cycling since he was young, Kenny started racing at the age of eleven. In 1988, at the age of 19, an accident at the Tour of Ireland whilst descending the Wicklow Gap looked likely to have ended his career. He had damaged his neck, but did not realise the extent of the damage at the time. A series of accidents after that exacerbated his condition, as Kenny put it: "until I was just lying on the sofa putting on weight and on heavy medication.”
At the age of 30, Kenny returned to cycling, initially to improve his fitness, but he soon began racing once more. Encouraged by a friend, Kenny contacted British Cycling to find out more about Paralympics racing. He competed at the British National Track Championships, achieving some good times, he was invited onto the Paralympic squad.
In January 2008, Kenny was nominated for "Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability" Laureus World Sports Awards, which recognise sporting achievement during the previous year.
Kenny managed to set a new world record in the preliminary round of the Individual pursuit (CP 3) at the 2008 Paralympics. The new record was 5.812 seconds faster than his own previous world record.
Kenny was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. Awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts by Bournemouth University in 2009 and an Honorary Degree Masters in Science by Brighton University.

Giovanni Minzoni

Giovanni Minzoni was born to a middle-class family. He studied in seminary and in 1909 was ordained priest. The following year he was appointed Deputy Pastor in the town of Argenta (in Emilia-Romagna), which he left in 1912 to go to study in the Scuola Sociale in Bergamo, where he was awarded his degree. Admired because of his courage and his determination to cooperate and talk with farmers, after the beginning of World War I Father Minzoni was sent to the front between Italy and Austro-Hungary as an army chaplain.
World War I.
Called up by the army of the Kingdom of Italy in August 1916, he asked to serve as a military chaplain among the young soldiers at the Italian north-eastern front, and during a very critical moment in the Battle of the Piave River, he showed great courage for which he was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor.
Campaign for social rights after World War I.
At the end of World War I, Fr Minzoni returned to Argenta, where he joined the Christian Party (Partito Popolare Italiano). Even if this was a semi-conservative party, he became friends with the socialist labor union leader Natale Gaiba, who was assassinated by the blackshirts in 1923. This and many other episodes turned him against Fascism. In addition to ideas about social rights, he became increasingly convinced of the need for cooperation, thus becoming an open enemy of the fascist regime that strongly favored corporativism.
Antifascism.
After some time Giovanni Minzoni rejected the introduction of the fascist youth movement, the Opera Nazionale Balilla in Argenta, because he preferred to educate the young people of the town in the values of Catholicism. After meeting Father Emilio Faggioli, the founder in April 1917 of the scout group Bologna I, and who became regional assistant for Catholic Scouts in Emilia-Romagna, Minzoni became convinced of the virtues and good values taught by the Scout Movement. He therefore decided to found a scout group in his own parish.
Scout movement in Argenta.
On July 8, 1923, Fr Emilio Faggioli was invited to the parish hall in Argenta to give a lecture on the educative value of scouting. Fagioli said, "Through this practice and discipline of the will and body, we aim to shape men with a strong temperament." Among those attending the lecture was the Fascist Party Secretary in Argenta, who shouted "But we already have Mussolini!". Monsignor Faggioli ignored him, and started speaking again, explaining to those present that scouting acts outside any political faction. "From now on, you will see young scouts along your roads with their big hats and a lily over their hearts. Please, look kindly on these young men walking and singing in the main square in Argenta."
"They will not be allowed into the main square," the fascist chief shouted. Then Fr Minzoni began to speak: "While I am here, they will go everywhere, even into the main square!" Deafening applause from seventy young men put an end to the diatribe. The seventy members of the Catholic Scouts in Argenta were a reality, and the menaces coming from the local fascist chief did not alarm them.
Death of Giovanni Minzoni.
Increasingly in conflict with the local Mussolinian establishment, Father Minzoni was killed around 10:30 pm on August 23, 1923 by two fascist "squadristi", who smashed his skull with a club; they were following orders of the local "Console di Milizia" Italo Balbo, who was so shaken by the scandal that he had to resign temporarily from his post.
Just before his death, Don Minzoni wrote:
His death turned his prayer into reality, with a promise made before departing for WWI:
Echoes in the Italian press.
After receiving news about the murder of Don Minzoni, Italian newspapers, Il Popolo d'Italia and ":it:La Voce Repubblicana", still partly free in 1923 extensively covered the murder, and soon disclosed all the direct executors of the fascist murder, and their secret instigator (Italo Balbo), later absolved at trial due to interference and pressure from the fascist squads and media. 
A new trial was held after the end of World War II, when the fascists were no longer able to threaten and cover up the truth. The verdict absolved Balbo from all the charges, although the trial ended with the condemnation of two men for second degree murder.
After the war, Giovanni Minzoni became a symbol of the Italian Catholic Resistance, and many books were written about the martyrdom of this lesser parish priest, widely known for his courage and sanctity.

Berthold of Hanover

Berthold of Hanover (died 24 July 1198) was a German Cistercian and Bishop of Livonia, who met his death in a crusade against the pagan Livonians.
Life.
He was Abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Lockum in Hanover. At the death of Saint Meinhard, the first Bishop of Livonia (c. 1196), Hartwig of Uthlede, Archbishop of Bremen, to whose province belonged the newly converted countries along the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, appointed Abbot Berthold successor. Damberger asserts that when Meinhard came to Bremen in 1186 to obtain help with his mission in Livonia, Berthold joined the band of missionaries who accompanied him there.
The Livonian pagans were fanatically opposed to Christianity. Berthold's predecessor, assisted by merchants from Bremen and Lübeck and a few converts, had built fortifications along the River Düna, where Christians held their religious services and could protect themselves. Following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Berthold tried to gain confidence and good will by kindness. At first the pagans appeared to become less hostile, but soon their old hatred revived. When Berthold attempted to bless the Christian cemetery at Holm, they decided either to burn the bishop together with his church at Holm or to drown him in the Düna. The Christians fled to their strongholds at Üxküll and Holm, while the bishop escaped in a ship to Lübeck.
Pope Celestine III, shortly before his death, was preparing to send a fleet of crusaders to protect the Christians of the Baltic Provinces, and his successor, Pope Innocent III, continued the work. Berthold gained the financial assistance of Archbishop Hartwig and many merchants of Bremen and Lübeck. In a short time a large fleet was ready for departure, well equipped and loaded with crusaders and many German peasants who were to settle permanently in Livonia. It put to sea at Lübeck and crossed the Baltic, entering the River Düna from what is now called the Gulf of Riga. Near the mouth of the Düna the German peasants landed with the purpose of making their homes in the vicinity, and laid the foundations of the city Riga. Berthold, accompanied by the crusaders, sailed up the river as far as Holm, where the Livonians had gathered with the intention of attacking the fleet.
Having failed to come to a peaceful agreement with them, Berthold and his companions sailed some distance down the river, with the Livonians in pursuit. The pagans agreed to a truce, to gain time, but they attacked the Christians who ventured outside their fortifications, and hostilities were resumed. The crusaders were victorious, but Berthold's horse became intractable and galloped into the midst of the fleeing Livonians. A pagan by the name of Ymaut (wrongly read as Ymant) thrust his lance into Berthold's back, inflicting a wound that caused speedy death.
The bishop's body was buried by the crusaders at Üxküll, and was later transferred to Riga by Albert of Riga, whom Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen had appointed Berthold's successor. After the death of Berthold some of the conquered pagans asked to be baptized. The final conversion of Livonia was effected by Bishop Albert, who was assisted in by the newly founded Order of the Brothers of the Sword, which in 1237 was affiliated with the Teutonic Order.

Waltham-on-the-Wolds railway station

Waltham on the Wolds railway station was a railway station at the end of The Waltham Branch serving the village of Waltham on the Wolds, Leicestershire. The Waltham Branch was built by the Great Northern Railway from the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway at Scalford to exploit ironstone deposits in the area.
The station opened in April 1883 but never had a regular passenger train service. This was confirmed in an edition of The Railway Magazine, published in May 1932.
Instead, it was used only for specials bringing visitors to Waltham Fair or to race meetings at Croxton Park until at least 1907.
From 1916 to 1918, it was used for military specials serving Harrowby Army Camp, after which it was used for freight or occasional enthusiasts specials until completely closed in 1964.

Henrik Grönvold

Henrik Grönvold (1858–1940) was a Danish naturalist and artist, known for his illustrations of birds. Grönvold was among the last natural history illustrators to publish lithographs.
Grönvold had an early interest in natural history, and an early aptitude for natural history art. He studied drawing in Copenhagen, and worked first as a draughtsman of the Royal Danish Army's artillery and an illustrator at the Biological Research Station of Copenhagen. In 1892, Grönvold left Denmark intending to emigrate to the United States. While stopping in London en route, he was employed at the Natural History Museum preparing anatomical specimens. Grönvold's Swedish wife Josefine joined him a year later.
Grönvold became a skilled taxidermist, and established a reputation as an artist. He was employed at the Museum until 1895, when he accompanied William Ogilvie-Grant on an expedition to the Salvage Islands. After this expedition, Grönvold worked at the Museum in an unofficial capacity as an artist for decades, and only left London to attend an ornithological congress in Berlin.
Grönvold's illustrations largely appeared in scientific periodicals such as the "Proceedings and Transactions of the Zoological Society", "The Ibis" and the "Avicultural Magazine". In these publications, he drew plates for William Ogilvie-Grant, George Albert Boulenger, and Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas, among others. Grönvold also completed numerous plates for Walter Rothschild, many of which appeared in Rothschild's journal "Novitates Zoologicae". Grönvold mostly illustrated birds and eggs, rare and newly discovered species from many parts of the world, and mostly worked in lithographs. His egg plates include some of Great Auk eggs made for Alfred Newton. He made some depictions of mammals as well, and the Natural History Museum collection has oil paintings of apes he made for Rothschild.
Among the books Grönvold illustrated is George Shelley's "Birds of Africa", which contained 57 plates, many of species that had not been illustrated before. He illustrated W. L. Buller's books on the birds of New Zealand, Brabourne's "Birds of South America", Henry Eliot Howard's "The British Warblers" (1907–14), Charles William Beebe's "A Monograph of the Pheasants" (1918–22), and Herbert Christopher Robinson's "The Birds of the Malay Peninsula" (1929–76). He completed 600 hand-coloured plates for twelve volumes of "The Birds of Australia" (1910–27) by Gregory Macalister Mathews. Grönvold subsequently provided numerous illustrations for Mathews' "The Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands" … (1928) and "A Supplement to The Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands" … (1936) – some of the last publications that were issued with hand-coloured plates.
Such was his contributions to bird art that a "Mirafra" lark was named for him in 1930. Grönvold died at Bedford in 1940. He was survived by his wife Josefine, and daughter Elsa, who had become a skilled portrait painter.

History.
In 1940 Melbourne businessman Sir William Charles Angliss donated money to start a specialist trade or technical school specialising in providing training and education opportunities for the hospitality and foods industries. Initially called the William Angliss Food Trades School, apprenticeship courses were offered in pastry, butchery, breadmaking and baking, cooking and waiting.
As links with the Food and Hospitality industries developed additional courses in hospitality administration, catering, and food and beverage service were initiated during the 1960s. Courses in Tourism were added in the 1970s. These changes lead to the school being renamed first the William Angliss College and then as William Angliss Institute of TAFE.
In 2001 the Travel and Tourism Department of the Institute developed a 3 month short course in "Dance Music Event Operations", to provide training in line with the growth of Melbourne's electronic dance scene. The course received accreditation by the Victorian Qualifications Authority in 2003.
The Institute started The Coffee Academy in 2002 offering three-hour Coffee@Home courses on a monthly basis, as well as more advanced sessions in coffee sensory evaluation, fully accredited courses in Espresso Making using quality commercial machines and even overseas coffee tours.
Embracing technology, the Institute purchased bulk phone-PDAs in 2005 in a pilot program to run teacher designed flash animation games to help deliver training, multimedia assignments and assessments for subjects such as coffee making, waiting, pastry baking, meat processing and event management.
France's most decorated chef, Paul Bocuse, lectured cookery students at William Angliss Institute in 2006.

Blindfold (film)

Blindfold is an American movie from 1965, by Universal Pictures, starring Rock Hudson and Claudia Cardinale that was based on Lucille Fletcher's 1960 novel of the same name.
This was the last film directed by Philip Dunne, who was a successful Hollywood screenwriter of pictures such as "How Green Was My Valley" and "The Robe". Sequences were filmed in Silver Springs, Florida.
Plot.
A patient being psychoanalyzed by Dr. Bartholomew Snow is a government scientist who evidently has had a mental breakdown. General Pratt, a national security chief, hides the patient, Arthur Vicenti, in a remote place known only as "Base X," forcing Dr. Snow to wear a blindfold whenever he is taken there.
Enemy agents want to know what Vicenti knows, so he is in danger. The patient's sister, beautiful Vicky Vicenti, mistakenly believes that Dr. Snow is the one who abducted him. When she has the doctor arrested, Snow tells both the authorities and the press that he and Vicky are actually having a lovers' quarrel and are engaged to be married. 
A man named Fitzpatrick turns up and claims to Dr. Snow that it is actually General Pratt himself who is the enemy agent. Unable to find the general, Dr. Snow tries to recreate sounds he heard while blindfolded to trace his way back to Base X.
He does so, only to find that Fitzpatrick has taken both Vicenti and Pratt captive. But soldiers arrive in airboats and place Fitzpatrick under arrest, leaving Vicky to consider whether she would like her make-believe engagement to Dr. Snow to be real.
Reception.
The film earned an estimated $2 million in rentals in North America.
Influence.
The scene where Hudson's character Dr Snow finds the secret base using only sounds he heard on the journey was borrowed for an almost identical scene in the 1992 film Sneakers.

Research.
Butterfield's research centres around a variety of topics in the philosophy of physics and philosophy of science, and he has also made contributions to the philosophy of language and logic, particularly with regard to the treatment of time and tense. In this regard, he has argued in several papers for a "detensed" theory of time, according to which the present is a merely subjective or indexical notion, on analogy with one's spatial location.
In the philosophy of quantum theory, Butterfield has proposed several clarifications of the notions of locality operative in algebraic quantum field theories (especially 'stochastic Einstein locality'), and has investigated which of these clarified versions of locality hold in those theories. He has also investigated the impact of the Bell inequalities in the light of Reichenbach's principle of the common cause, and has argued that the violation of these inequalities implies causation between the space-like separated wings of a Bell experiment. In addition, he has written on the quantum measurement problem, and the implications for it due to, and of it for, the philosophy and science of consciousness. He has also investigated the problems of localizability in relativistic quantum theories, in collaboration with Gordon Fleming.
In the philosophy of spacetime physics, Butterfield has argued for a resolution of Einstein's 1913 hole argument that preserves spacetime substantivalism by utilizing David Lewis's theory of modal counterparts. More recently, he has appealed to tensor calculus, and its use in much of contemporary physics, to argue against the popular view (propounded by David Lewis) that the world may be described in terms of 'local matters of fact'; i.e. in terms of chiefly intrinsic properties instantiated at spatial or spatio-temporal points.
In the philosophy of classical mechanics, Butterfield has investigated the elimination of descriptively redundant formal elements through "symplectic reduction", and the interdependence between conserved quantities and conservation laws. He has also made several appeals in his work, on classical mechanics and other physical theories, to the importance of an appreciation of "modality" in physics.
In several papers, Butterfield has collaborated with the theoretical physicist Chris Isham. These address the role of topos theory in understanding quantum theory (in particular the Kochen-Specker theorem), and the status of time in the various quantum gravity research programmes.
Recently, Butterfield has argued for a reconciliation of the idea of "emergence" – the idea that novel structures, not described by "fundamental" theories, appear at a certain level of complexity – with the possibility of inter-theoretic reduction.

Fuck the World (Insane Clown Posse song)

"Fuck the World" is a song by hip hop duo, Insane Clown Posse, performed by member Violent J, and is their second single from their album "The Amazing Jeckel Brothers". The song is one of their best known, notable for using the word "fuck" 95 times, 93 times by Violent J and twice by Shaggy 2 Dope.
Background.
In 1996, Insane Clown Posse signed a contract with Danny J -owned label Hollywood Records, which reportedly paid US$1 million to purchase their contract from Battery/Jive Records. Their album "The Great Milenko", which featured guests Alice Cooper (on vocals), Steve Jones (on guitar), and Slash (on guitar), was recorded and released on June 25, 1997. However, just hours after the release, Hollywood Records pulled the album from stores nationwide, cancelled Insane Clown Posse's in-store signings and nationwide tour, pulled commercials for the album and the music video for "Halls of Illusions" from television, and dropped the group from the label. It was later revealed that Disney pulled the album to prevent further controversy from the Southern Baptist Church who was criticizing Disney at the time because of Disney's promotion of Gay Days at Disneyland. The incident became highly publicized, which resulted in Insane Clown Posse gaining a lot of attention from the media.
During the two years between "The Great Milenko" and "The Amazing Jeckel Brothers", the first album released after the group left Disney, Insane Clown Posse had become nationally known, but were not taken very seriously. While the controversy allowed the duo to attract the attention of Island Records, it also attracted Insane Clown Posse to public criticism for their style and lyrics. Bruce recalls the period as an angry era for the group due to all of the negativity directed toward them. He says that they "used to keep two piles of press at office. One pile was all the positive press [they've gotten, which was under an inch tall. Then had the negative press pile, which was spilling over the side of a full basket." As a result, "The Amazing Jeckel Brothers" was recorded as a release for their anger.
To help increase their positive publicity, Island Records hired the Nasty Little Man publicity team. The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of "Alternative Press" magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated "Fuck the Beastie Boys and the Dalai Lama" needed to be changed. Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again – referring to Disney's previous requirement of censure. Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric. In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.
Concept.
The song follows an angry Violent J as he curses a wide variety of things. The chorus echoes the same hate for the world illustrated in each verse ("If I only could I'd set the world on fire/Fuck the world/Fuck 'em all"). While the song consists of seemingly mindless cursing throughout most of it, the futility of such rage is illustrated in the final curse, as he adds "and fuck Violent J." Notable people, places, and objects cursed include Beastie Boys, the Dalai Lama, Forrest Gump, Oprah Winfrey, Kyle Petty, Tom Petty, Fred Bear, Ted Nugent, The Count of Monte Cristo, Cisco, Jack Brisco, Jerry Brisco, "Titanic", Celine Dion, Dionne Warwick, Berlin Wall, Lyle Lovett, Jumpsteady, Rocky Maivia, "Spin", "Rolling Stone", "VIBE", President Bill Clinton, and Violent J himself.
The group also used the line "Fuck the police, and the 5-0 too", which came from the late rapper Eazy-E's song "8 Ball".
Performance.
During live shows, Insane Clown Posse will usually change the lyrics to add other insults to people or figures that reflect the current time, public radio, MTV, Blender Magazine, and themselves.
"Fuck the World" was one of the songs performed by Insane Clown Posse at Woodstock '99.
Cover versions.
The single was recorded and remixed by the Axe Murder Boys in 2010 for DJ Clay's Book of the Wicked, Chapter One mixtape.

At the time he was attached to the Nigerian Army, on secondment from the 1st Royal Tank Regiment. He served in South Kasai and then Katanga, where he became briefly famous for his part in the rescue of several groups of missionaries, and was nicknamed "Dick the Lionheart" by the "Daily Express". In 1963 he published a book recounting his time in the Congo, entitled "Strange Soldiering: Major Lawson's own dramatic story of his experiences with the third Nigerian brigade". For his actions he was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 30 March 1962, and the Nigerian officer, Major Conrad Diba Nwawo, 1st Battalion, The Queen's Own Nigeria Regiment, who accompanied Lawson was awarded the Military Cross, Lawson was also appointed an Officer of the Order of the Crown of Belgium, and a Knight Commander of the Papal Order of St. Sylvester.
From March to November 1967 Lawson undertook another secondment in a British colony on the verge of independence, the Federation of South Arabia (now part of Yemen), acting as GSO1 to the British forces stationed there, training local officers in staff duties, and overseeing the transition to local forces controlling security in Aden; for this he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 8 June 1968, in the Queen's Birthday Honours. During this period he was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 30 June 1967. He was promoted colonel on 6 July 1971 and brigadier on 31 December 1971.

In 1471, in a reaction to a Cham raid against Hóa Châu, king Lê Thánh Tông of Đại Việt (Vietnam), invaded Champa. P'an-Lo T'ou-Ts'iuan then called the Khmers for help. The Khmers, however, refused because they hadn't forgotten the destruction of Angkor by the Cham king Indravarman VI. The Vietnamese then attacked the Cham capital of Vijaya, murdering 60,000 and imprisoning another 30,000. This was the final defeat of Champa, which then became a minor Viet province.

Lonardo was born in 1911 in Warren to Joseph and Concetta Lonardo. His godfather was Anthony Milano. After his father was murdered by a member of the Porrello crime family in 1929, 18 year old Lonardo swore revenge and murdered Salvatore Todaro with his cousin Dominic Sospirato. Lonardo was tried and sentenced to life in prison. However, his lawyer was able to get a second trial and he was discharged and released. He later joined Milano's brother Frank in the Cleveland crime family. He eventually worked his way up to underboss in 1976. After his arrest in 1983, Lonardo became a government informant and testified against his former colleagues and several mob figures throughout the United States. Lonardo, together with Jimmy Fratianno, the acting boss of the Los Angeles crime family were the highest ranking mobsters to become federal witnesses, until Gambino crime family underboss, Sammy "the Bull" Gravano during the early 1990s. He eventually went into the federal witness protection program, but left it to return to Cleveland. Angelo Lonardo died in his sleep on April 1, 2006, aged 95.

Roger of Seaton

Roger of Seaton (1230–1280) was a British justice. He studied canon law at Oxford University, and by 1258 he was a qualified "magister", a rarity for British justices of the time; of the sixty or so justices who had served under Richard I only three held such a title, with ninety and eight respectively for those who had served under John of England. By 1260 he was using his knowledge of Canon law as the commissary-general for Walter of Kirkham, the Bishop of Durham, as well as his immediate successor, Robert Stitchill, serving as one of his chancellors and also his executor.
In 1268 he switched from an ecclesiastical career to a judicial one, and was appointed as a justice with the Court of Common Pleas. He left the court in 1271 to lead an Eyre circuit that travelled through south-eastern and eastern England, although the circuit was brought to an end in 1272 by the death of Henry III. After the premature end to the Eyre Roger was reappointed as a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and became the Chief Justice of that court in 1274 after the death of Gilbert of Preston, serving until 1278. During this period he served as an Assize judge in 1273 and 1274 and the judge of an Eyre circuit in Middlesex in 1274 and again in London and in Bedfordshire in 1276. From late 1272 until October 1274 he served as High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, and gave a speech at the 1275 Parliament explaining the king's need for money.
Soon after his 1278 retirement Roger suffered a stroke, and in 1279 entered the Augustinian house in Thornton. He appointed several executors to pay his debtors and distribute his estate, including Oliver Sutton and Nicholas of Higham. He died soon after, and left his remaining possessions to his brother, Richard of Seaton.

<doc id="19217617" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19217617" title="Inocybe geophylla">
Inocybe geophylla

Inocybe geophylla, commonly known as the Earthy Inocybe, Common White Inocybe or White Fibrecap, is a poisonous mushroom of the genus "Inocybe". It is widespread and common in Europe and North America, appearing under both conifer and deciduous trees in summer and autumn. The fruiting body is a small all-white or cream mushroom with a fibrous silky umbonate cap and adnexed gills. An all-lilac variety "lilacina" is also common.
Taxonomy and naming.
It was first described as "Agaricus geophyllus" by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, before being given its current binomial name in 1871 by Paul Kummer. Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek terms "geo-" “earth”, and "phyllon" “leaf”. A lilac form is known as var. "lilacina"; it was originally described as "Agaricus lilacinus" by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1872, before being given its current name by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1876.
Description.
The cap is 1–4 cm (0.4–2.6 in) in diameter and white or cream-coloured with a silky texture, at first conical before flattening out to a more convex shape with a pronounced umbo (boss). The cap margins may split with age. The thin stipe is 1–6 cm (0.4–2.4 in) high and 0.3–0.6 cm thick and lacks a ring. The crowded gills are adnexed and cream early, before darkening to a brownish colour with the developing spores. The spore print is brown. The almond-shaped spores are smooth and measure around 9 × 5 μm. The faint smell has been likened to meal, damp earth, or even described as spermatic.
The variety "lilacina" is similar in shape but tinted lilac all over, with an ochre-brown flush on the cap umbo and the base of the stem. It has a strong mealy or earthy odour. This variety could be mistaken for the edible amethyst deceiver ("Laccaria amethystina"), although the latter species has a fibrous stipe, a fruity smell and lacks the ochre-coloured umbo.
Distribution and habitat.
"Inocybe geophylla" is common and widespread across Europe and North America. It is mycorrhizal, the fruiting bodies are found in deciduous and coniferous woodlands in summer and autumn. Within these locations, fruiting bodies may be found in grassy areas and near pathways, or often on rich, bare soil that has been disturbed at roadsides, and near ditches.
In Western Australia, Matheny & Bougher (2005) point to collections of what was referred to as "I. geophylla" var. "lilacina" by some Australian taxonomists, as a misapplication of the name "I. geophylla" var. "lilacina"; the specimens have been reclassified as the species "Inocybe violaceocaulis".
Toxicity.
Like many fibrecaps, "Inocybe geophylla" contains muscarine. The symptoms are those of muscarine poisoning, namely, greatly increased salivation, perspiration (sweating), and lacrimation (tear flow) within 15–30 minutes of ingestion. With large doses, these symptoms may be followed by abdominal pain, severe nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, and labored breathing. Intoxication generally subsides within two hours. Delirium does not occur. 
The specific antidote is atropine. Inducing vomiting to remove mushroom contents is also prudent due to the speed of onset of symptoms. It is also dangerous to dose atropine, as that itself, can cause toxicity and death with too large or repeated doses.
Death has not been recorded as a result of consuming this species. It is often ignored by mushroom hunters because of its small size.

Nonintrusive load monitoring

Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), or nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM), is a process for analyzing changes in the voltage and current going into a house and deducing what appliances are used in the house as well as their individual energy consumption. Electric meters with NILM technology are used by utility companies to survey the specific uses of electric power in different homes. NILM is considered a low cost alternative to attaching individual monitors on each appliance. It does, however, present privacy concerns.
Background and theory.
Nonintrusive Load Monitoring was invented by George W. Hart, Ed Kern and Fred Schweppe of MIT in the early 1980s with funding from the Electric Power Research Institute.
The basic process is described in . As shown in figure 1 from the patent, a digital AC monitor is attached to the single-phase power going into a residence. Changes in the voltage and current are measured (i.e. admittance measurement unit), normalized (Scaler) and recorded (Net Change Detector Unit). A cluster analysis is then performed to identify when different appliances are turned on and off. If a 60-watt bulb is turned on, for example, followed by a 100 watt bulb being turned on, followed by the 60 watt bulb being turned off followed by the 100 watt bulb being turned off, the NALM unit will match the on and off signals from the 60 watt bulb and the on and off signals from the 100 watt bulb to determine how much power was used by each bulb and when. The system is sufficiently sensitive that individual 60 watt bulbs can be discriminated due to the normal variations in actual power draw of bulbs with the same nominal rating. (e.g. one bulb might draw 61 watts, another 62 watts).
The system can measure both reactive power and real power. Hence two appliances with the same total power draw can be distinguished by differences in their complex impedance. As shown in figure 8 from the patent, for example, a refrigerator electric motor and a pure resistive heater can be distinguished in part because the electric motor has significant changes in reactive power when it turns on and off, whereas the heater has almost none.
NILM systems can also identify appliances with a series of individual changes in power draw. These appliances are modeled as finite state machines. A dishwasher, for example, has heaters and motors that turn on and off during a typical dish washing cycle. These will be identified as clusters, and power draw for the entire cluster will be recorded. Hence “dishwasher” power draw can be identified as opposed to “Resistor heating unit” and “Electric motor”. 
Privacy Concerns.
NILM can detect what types of appliances people have and their behavioral patterns. Patterns of energy use may indicate behavior patterns, such as routine times that nobody is at home, or embarrassing or illegal behavior of residents. It could, for example, reveal when the occupants of a house are using the shower, or when individual lights are turned on and off.
If the NILM is running remotely at a utility or by a third party, the homeowner may not know that their behavior is being monitored and recorded. 
A stand-alone in home system, under the control of the user, can provide feedback about energy use, without revealing information to others. Drawing links between their behavior and energy consumption may help reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency, flatten peak loads, save money, or balance appliance use with green energy availability. However the use of a stand-alone system does not protect one from remote monitoring.
The accuracy and capability of this technology is still developing and is not 100% reliable in near-real-time, such that complete information is accumulated and analyzed over periods ranging from minutes to hours.

A Frank Statement

A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers was a historic advertisement run by major American tobacco companies on January 4, 1954 in response to a study showing that cigarette tar caused cancerous tumors on mouse skin. The advertisement ran in more than 400 newspapers throughout the U.S. aimed at an estimated 43 million people. It was the first in a campaign to dispute reports that smoking cigarettes could cause lung cancer and had other dangerous health effects.
The public relations firm Hill & Knowlton created the advertisement after a meeting in New York late in 1953 between them and Paul Hahn (head of American Tobacco) and other tobacco executives. The tobacco industry followed it with other advertisements expressing doubt about scientific research linking disease and smoking.
Historical context.
Reports of a link between tobacco and lung cancer had emerged as early as 1912, although until the 1950s, the evidence was circumstantial. In the early 1950s, Richard Doll released the results of the British Doctors Study which showed a 20-fold increase in lung cancer susceptibility in smokers. In 1953, an animal study by Ernst Wynder found that tobacco tar was carcinogenic when applied to the skin of mice. The increased evidence that tobacco causes cancer was covered in the "Reader's Digest" article, "Cancer by the carton". This article provoked a health scare, resulting in a small drop in consumption, and a fall in stock prices. In this context, some tobacco industry executives, lead by Paul Hahn, head of American Tobacco, met with Hill & Knowlton, who created "A Frank Statement".
Claims.
The advertisement claimed:
Promises.
The advertisement also made several promises on behalf of the tobacco industry which were later disputed by the scientific community. "A Frank Statement" says that its authors believed that the products they made were safe. In a 2002 assessment of the promises made by the advertisement, it was concluded that some tobacco industry scientists had concluded that there was a causal relationship between tobacco and cancer. The tobacco industry did not acknowledge a causal link with cancer until 1999.
The statement also pledged "aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health", and announced the establishment of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC) towards that aim. Much of the TIRC funded research was not directly connected to smoking and health, and neither it nor its successor, the Council for Tobacco Research, ever acknowledged a proven link between smoking and serious and life-threatening illness. Despite the lack of relevance of many TIRC funded research to the health effects of smoking, some in the tobacco industry publicized their funding of the TIRC to reassure the public.
Finally, the advertisement promised that the industry "always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health". According to Cummings, Morley, and Hyland, "there is abundant evidence that the tobacco industry went to great lengths to undermine tobacco control efforts of the public health community." An example of this is a memo from the vice-president to the president of the Tobacco Institute in which the industry's strategy was described as "creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it", and "advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice".

USS Hidalgo (AK-189)

USS "Hidalgo" (AK-189) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship that was constructed for the U.S. Navy during the closing period of "World War II". She was declared excess-to-needs and returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission.
Built in Superior, Wisconsin.
"Hidalgo" (AK-189), a diesel-powered C1-M-AV1 cargo hull, was launched 28 July 1944 under Maritime Commission contract by Walter Butler Shipbuilding, Inc., Superior, Wisconsin, sponsored by Mrs. Claude Pepper, wife of the Senator from "Florida"; placed in service while being towed to Galveston, Texas, and commissioned 4 August 1945, Lt. John W. Thompson in command.
Naval service.
After conducting a brief shakedown cruise off the coast of Texas, "Hidalgo" sailed to the Panama Canal Zone for routing to the Pacific Ocean 5 September 1945, but the war's end brought orders to proceed to Norfolk, Virginia.
Dispositioning.
The ship arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia, 11 March 1946 and decommissioned 26 April 1946. Subsequently, she was sold to Turkey for $693,862.00 and serves as cargo ship "SS Rize" in merchant service.

Mihr 'Ali

Mihr 'Ali (fl. 1795-"post" 1830) (also spelt Mir Ali) was one of the great royal painters of the Persian court during the reign of Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar, and is regarded as the most notable Persian portraitist of the early part of this reign. Mihr Ali was one of the foremost painters of the early period of Qajar art.
Mihr 'Ali's chief skill was his ability to capture the portrait-sitter's grandeur and power, and as such he became a favourite painter of the Shah. Mihr 'Ali produced at least ten full-size oil paintings of Fat'h Ali Shah, one of the earliest of which was probably sent as a present to the amirs of Sind in 1800. A further portrait, of the Shah enthroned, was sent to Napoleon. Mihr Ali's finest portrait is an 1813–4 work, regarded by some as the finest Persian oil painting in existence. It shows a full-length portrait of the King wearing a gold brocade robe and a royal crown, holding a jewelled staff.
Fat'h Ali Shah commissioned great numbers of lifesize portraits of himself and his sons, works which formed the backdrop to court ceremonies. The works, painted by Mihr 'Ali and his predecessor as court painter, Mirza Baba, portrayed Fat'h Ali Shah in his manyb stately roles, and were intended to show his power as a ruler rather than to be realistic portraits. As a result, the works are heavily stylised, are painted in rich, deep tones, and are filled with symbols of power.
Other important works by Mehr 'Ali include a series of portraits of Persian rulers and figures from the "Shahnameh", commissioned by Fat'h Ali Shah as decoration for the 'Imarat-i Naw Palace in Isfahan. This series of works was notable enough to be mentioned in the reports of many of the European travellers to Isfahan, such as James Morier (in "A Journey through Persia in the years 1808 and 1809", published in 1812), Sir William Ouseley in 1812 (in "Travels into various Countries of the East", published in 1823), and Charles Texier (in "Description de l'Arménie, la Perse et la Mesopotamie", published in 1852). Until 1985, it was thought that all of the paintings in this series had been destroyed, but three have since been discovered and authenticated, those being portraits of Afrasiyab, Genghis Khan, and Kay Khusraw, though the Kay Khusraw portrait does not exist in its full form but has been reduced to only some 80% of its original size. Despite this, it sold at auction at Christie's in London in 2007 for £54,000 ($US 107,500). The other two works are also in private hands, having been auctioned by the same company in 1987.
Mihr 'Ali was also a capable teacher, his pupils including the noted painter Abul-Hasan Ghaffari.

Poliosis

Poliosis is the decrease or absence of melanin (or color) in head hair, eyebrows, or eyelashes. It can give rise to a "Mallen Streak" that can be hereditary.
Catherine Cookson wrote a novel and later a TV series called "The Mallen Streak", where a family had the condition. Sports presenter Dickie Davies and runner Sam Brown were famous for this feature. People with Waardenburg syndrome usually present this symptom, as do 60% of patients with tuberous sclerosis.
This condition can cause white patches (singular or multiple - usually single) on the hair. Most people confuse these white patches as simple birth marks.

Financial Supervisory Service (South Korea)

The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is South Korea's integrated financial regulator that examines and supervises financial institutions under the broad oversight of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the government regulatory authority staffed by civil servants.
History.
Financial Supervisory system in S. Korea prior to FSS.
Before the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) was established, Korea’s financial supervisory system was largely fragmented, with the banking, securities, insurance, and non-bank sectors individually managed and regulated by a separate agency. Furthermore, the authority of supervision was split between two governing entities, i.e. the supervisory agencies and the Ministry of Finance and Economy (formerly known as the Ministry of Finance; currently the Ministry of Strategy and Finance). Under this segregated supervisory system, the banking sector was overseen by the Bank of Korea and the ministry, the securities sector by the Securities Supervisory Board and the ministry, and the insurance sector by the Insurance Supervisory Board and the ministry. As to non-bank financial institutions established after the 1970s, the overall authority lay with the ministry while functions of examination were delegated to the Banking Supervisory Authority within the Bank of Korea and the Korea Non-Bank Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Establishment of Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).
The end of the 1980s marked a time of diversification in the financial industry and businesses’ crossover into other financial sectors. Meanwhile, the financial environment changed considerably with the opening of markets to foreign investments and the ongoing march of globalization. This led to an increasing number of complex financial transactions – such as derivatives – that blurred the boundaries of banking, securities, and insurance. The multifarious financial supervisory system of the past, in which the banking, securities, and insurance sectors were each regulated by their respective supervisory agencies, was no longer fit to address the innovations in the financial environment. As a result, the government established the Presidential Committee on Financial Reform in 1997, which announced a final report detailing the following recommendations for reform of the financial supervisory system:
Following the guidelines set forth by the committee’s report, the government drafted financial reform bills in August 1997. Based on a recommendation by the International Monetary Fund to establish an integrated financial supervisory body, the National Assembly passed the bill on December 29, 1997. On April 1, 1998, the Financial Supervisory Commission (the predecessor to the Financial Services Commission) was launched as the FSS’s supreme decision-making body, laying the groundwork for the consolidation of the four supervisory bodies (the Banking Supervisory Authority, Securities Supervisory Board, Insurance Supervisory Board, and the Non-bank Deposit Insurance Corporation. To preserve sectoral characteristics while flexibly addressing businesses’ branching into other sectors, a committee of executives and staff from the four supervisory bodies was put together to work out a plan for the consolidated agency. On January 2, 1999, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) was finally established.
Major progress.
The consolidation of the financial supervisory system helped Korea to quickly and efficiently recover from the Asian financial crisis that broke out at the end of 1997. The FSS led an intensive restructuring of the financial industry, eliminating insolvent financial companies and putting the financial system back on track. Over a six-year period extending from 1998 to 2003, 840 financial companies – including 14 banks – were removed from the market through M&As, P&As, or liquidation. To combat increased corporate insolvency resulting from the Asian financial crisis, the FSS successfully headed a corporate restructuring drive that implemented a series of measures like the improvement of conglomerates’ financial structure, liquidation of failing companies, and workout program. The FSS also reacted expeditiously to the credit card crunch and market distress of 2003 – caused by excessive credit card business expansion – by strengthening prudent supervision of credit card companies and encouraging the development of M&As in order to prevent uncertainty from spreading throughout the financial market.
The integrated supervisory agency also facilitated a systematic application and supervision of programs introduced in the aftermath of the crisis, such as forward-looking criteria (FLC), a system of financial holding companies, and the retirement pension plan. In enforcing prudent regulations such as prompt corrective action, business management evaluation, and capital adequacy ratio, it was also able to coordinate and maintain equity across financial sectors.
Purpose and Vision.
Purpose.
The purpose of the Financial Supervisory Service is to contribute to the growth of the national economy by 1) promoting the advancement of the financial industry and the stability of financial markets; 2) establishing sound credit order and fair financial transaction practices; and 3) protecting financial consumers, such as depositors. (Article 1, Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission)
Legal status.
The FSS was established for a special purpose and is legally based on the Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission. It administers public affairs independent from the central and regional governments of Korea. The intended effect of its legal status as an independent public entity rather than a governmental operation is twofold: 1) to minimize government interference of the FSS’s supervision of financial institutions; and 2) to ensure a fair and independent execution of its supervisory services.
Vision.
The FSS adheres to a philosophy of a ‘client-focused mindset,’ ‘high-level of expertise,’ and ‘financial supervision that builds the public trust.’ To realize its vision, the organization stresses five core values: client orientation, professionalism, fairness, transparency, and accountability.(FSS Vision Website)
Management and Structure.
Executives (as of May 14, 2012).
Its current governor Kwon Hyouk-Se was named to his position in March 2011 after a career of nearly three decades in finance-related positions in the government, including with the Ministry of Finance and Economy(Mofe, predecessor to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, and the Financial Services Commission.
Organizational structure (as of June 13, 2012).
The FSS headquarters in Seoul has 38 departments, and 13 offices. Regional offices are in operation in Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, and Daejeon, and representative offices in Jeonju, Chuncheon, Chungju, and Jeju. The FSS is also present in New York, London, Tokyo, and Beijing, and has residing staff in Washington D.C., Frankfurt and Hong Kong.
The FSS established Financial Consumer Protection Agency directly reporting to and under the supervision of the Governor on May 15, 2012, independent of supervision and examination divisions.
Deliberation and advisory committees.
Financial Disputes Settlement Committee.
Pursuant to Article 51 of the Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission, the Financial Disputes Settlement Committee is a quasi-judicial body established within the FSS to promptly and fairly resolve financial disputes among users of financial institutions. When a user of or a party concerned with a financial institution applies for a settlement of a dispute, the committee will, depending on the nature of dispute, either recommend the parties involved to reach an agreement or deliberate to resolve the dispute upon verification of facts. The committee is composed of up to 30 members, including an FSS deputy governor who serves as the committee chairman. Other members of the committee include assistant deputy governors of the FSS and specialists representing the legal profession, customer groups, financial sectors, academia, and other relevant sectors. As an out-of-court dispute resolution body, the Financial Disputes Settlement Committee assumes a voluntary role in dispute mediation. However, when both parties to a dispute accept a mediator’s proposal, the proposal carries the same effect as an in-court settlement. In this sense, the functions performed by the committee can be said to be quasi-judicial. (Section 5 “Mediation of Financial Disputes,” Act on the Establishment, etc. Of Financial Services Commission)
Sanctions Review Committee.
The Sanctions Review Committee advises the Governor of the FSS regarding deliberation of sanctions pursuant to the Regulations on Examination and Sanctions of Financial Institutions. Charged with deliberating a variety of possible sanctions instituted by the Financial Services Commission and/or the Governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, whether against a business' operations or employees, or financial sanctions, the committee is operated to ensure the fairness and equity of sanction measures. The committee is composed of nine members: head and deputy head of sanctions deliberation, head of case presentation, FSS legal advisor (these four members are internal members), FSC representative in charge of case presentation, and four external members chosen from among lawyers, professors, and/or financial experts with professional knowledge of finance-related statutes or scholarship and experience in finance. The three external members are appointed by the Governor of the FSS. Meetings of the committee shall be convened whenever a majority of its members deems it necessary, and resolutions are passed by majority consent of all attending members.
Major Functions.
FSS acts as the executive supervisor for the FSC and principally carries out examination of financial institutions along with enforcement and other oversight activities as directed or charged by the FSC.
External Relations.
Financial Services Commission.
The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is a central public administration agency falling under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Prime Minister, and is charged with the deliberation and determination of financial policies and other important matters of financial supervision – such as the supervision, examination, and sanctioning of financial institutions, and authorization and licensing of financial institutions. Pursuant to the relevant legal provisions, the FSC may direct and supervise the operations of the FSS. In addition to its inherent responsibilities of supervising and sanctioning financial institutions, the FSS supports the operations of the FSC and its adjoined Securities & Futures Commission, and executes those FSC duties which are entrusted by the FSC to the FSS. (Article 37, Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission) 
Prior to February 2008, the law provided that the Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (the predecessor to the Financial Services Commission) be concurrently appointed as the Governor of the FSS, with the FSS directly assisting the operations of the commission. The revision of the Act in February 2008 clearly distinguishes the policy-making function of the FSC and the supervisory enforcement function of FSS, and provides that different persons be assigned to head each organization to ensure more effective checks and balances (Article 29 (2) of the Act). The revision also provides that the Governor of FSS may, as an ex-officio member of the FSC, request to the FSC chairman that matters necessary within the scope of FSS operation be included in the commission’s agenda.
Bank of Korea.
The Bank of Korea may, when the Monetary Policy Committee deems it necessary for the implementation of monetary and credit policies, request the FSS to perform an examination of a bank and/or other financial institutions, or ask that its staff jointly participate in an FSS-led examination. The Bank of Korea may also request the FSS to send the result of examination and ask for certain necessary corrective measures based on the results. When the FSC takes measures that are directly related to monetary and/or credit policies, the Bank of Korea may ask for reconsideration of the measures if it has any objections. 
Following the September 2009 signing of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on information sharing and joint examination among the FSS, the Bank of Korea, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the FSC, and the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FSS and the Bank of Korea agreed to widen the range of information shared between the entities and increase cooperation to promptly execute joint examinations for emergency cases.
Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation may, when deemed necessary for its operation, request the FSS to perform an examination of insured financial companies or ask that its staff jointly participate in an FSS-led examination. Based on the aforementioned MOU, the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation and FSS share the financial information of financial companies with each other.
Korea Asset Management Corporation.
The FSC supervises the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO), gives directives in relation to its supervision, and receives reports from the corporation on its operations, accounting, and assets. Under instruction of the FSC, the Governor of the FSS may examine the operations, accounting, and assets of KAMCO.
Current Issues.
Early recovery from the crisis.
Even before the breakout of the financial crisis, the key policy objective of the FSS was to stabilize the financial market and enhance the health and soundness of Korea’s financial institutions. During the recent period of credit expansion, the FSS took a series of strengthened measures of prudency such as Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income DTI regulations in March 2006 and the 30% rule restricting savings banks’ project finance (PF) loans in August 2006. From August 2007, when the sub-prime mortgage crisis emerged in the United States, the FSS established and operated a comprehensive monitoring system to track new market developments.
In September 2008, amid rising distress in global financial markets in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the FSS committed itself to market stabilization to ensure an early recovery from the crisis. It operated a round-the-clock monitoring system that was linked with its offices overseas, government agencies, and financial institutions, while closely coordinating policies with the relevant organizations to promptly deal with potential instability factors. The FSS also established a contingency examination system that required its examination competence to focus on preventing systemic risks; its on-site general examination functions were deferred to accommodate the screening of potential risks.
In October 2008, the FSS set up the Foreign Debt Service Guarantee Task Force, thereby working to quickly recover the finance sector’s intermediary role by improving banks’ liquidity ratio and helping to ease the domestic and foreign liquidity crunch faced by local companies. To prevent bad loans from accumulating, the FSS urged banks to maintain a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) ratio of 12% or higher and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9% or higher as of end of 2008.
The financial crisis was also an opportunity to crack down on unsound business practices that contributed to increased volatility in the foreign currency and stock markets. To ward off unwarranted concerns that served to undermine market confidence, the FSS regularly organized conference calls and issue briefings for domestic and international institutional investors and analysts, as well as briefings for the foreign press.
Corporate restructuring.
The expiration of the old Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act at the end of 2005 highlighted the need to address the limitations of creditor banks’ sole discretion over corporate restructuring. As a result, the new Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act was enacted in November 2007. After the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the resulting shortage of liquidity and economic recession, industries particularly susceptible to global economic cycles – such as construction, shipbuilding, and shipping – were in dire need of restructuring. In November 2008, the FSS organized the Corporate Credit Task Force in a joint FSS-FSC undertaking to ease businesses’ financial distress and improve their financial position. In December of the same year, the FSS announced directives and policies for major corporate restructuring.
From January to April 2009, credit risk evaluations were conducted on construction companies, shipbuilders, and shipping companies faced with solvency risks. Based on the results of the evaluations, 46 companies were placed on a corporate workout procedure. By the end of September 2009, six of the companies had been normalized, 17 were still undergoing the workout, and 23 were in the process of court receivership. Subsequent to the industry-specific restructuring drive, the FSS also initiated a restructuring process for the corporate sector at large. Large individual companies with outstanding credit lines of 50 billion won or more were subjected to credit risk evaluations; of 433 companies, 33 were selected for restructuring. By the end of September 2009, three had completed the workout program, 13 were in the process of normalizing their operations through workout, and 17 were in the process of court receivership program.
Given the large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the limited availability of information on which to determine restructuring, SME credit risk evaluations were performed in different stages based on the size of credit loans. In July 2009, the first round of evaluations screened 861 companies that were subject to external audits and had in excess of 5 billion won in debt; of them, 113 were selected for restructuring. In the second round of evaluations that ended in September 2009, 1,461 companies subject to external audits and carrying 3 billion won or more in debts were screened, of which 174 were ordered to restructure. In the third round of evaluations that ended in December 2009, companies subject to external audits with debts of 1 billion won or more and those not subject to external audits but with debts of 3 billion won or more were screened; of the 1,842 companies screened, 225 were selected to undergo restructuring.
Microfinance and SME support.
In an effort to assist with the financial needs of low-income groups severely hit by the global financial crisis, the FSS launched the Microfinance 119 Service (s119.fss.or.kr) on its portal website in March 2009. The website was designed to offer microfinance information and other related services to low-income earners. The portal website offers eight services, including loan information, free credit checks, information on voice phishing fraud, checks on legally established financial institutions, financial knowledge, credit recovery programs, rehabilitation support programs, and reports of illegal financial practices.
To ensure that the services can be accessed from a wider range of channels – for the convenience of service users – the FSS linked its portal service to the websites of 370 financial institutions. The Microfinance 119 Service extended individually tailored loans to 33,000 customers, absorbing 14.2 billion won of illegal private loans into the established market in the process. The portal also contributed to promoting the Hope Loan program, offered in cooperation with financial institutions. From March 1, 2009 to December 4, 2009, 201,774 customers with low credit ratings or low income levels received a combined total of 1.18 trillion won in loans through the program. (FSS's Microfinance 119 Service website)
The FSS also took a series of measures to strengthen the lines of support to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in times of liquidity shortage during the global financial crisis. Working jointly with the Korea Federation of Banks and other organizations, the FSS introduced the SME Fast Track program in October 2008, injecting a combined liquidity of 2.82 trillion won to 1,672 SMEs by the end of 2008. By coordinating policies with the FSC and other relevant agencies, and enlisting the active cooperation of the financial sector, the FSS helped to increase the guarantee amount from guarantee institutions and to extend the maturity of SME loans. Thanks to the combination of SME support measures, SME loans increased by 52.4 trillion won in 2008 – despite the bleak economic circumstances of the global financial crisis – which is comparable with the average increase of 56.7 trillion won in 2006 and 2007.
Supervisory Objectives.
The FSS is geared to emphasize on-site supervision and examinations in its commitment to establishing itself as financial regulator that markets and consumers trust. 
The FSS will strengthen prudential supervision to prevent worsening economic and financial conditions from leading to financial distress in companies. The FSS will provide more financial support for low-income people and SMEs, particularly vulnerable to economic recession, and concentrate on strengthening consumer protection. The FSS is hosting such regular events as Heart-to-Heart Talk and Campus Talk on Finance in its efforts to share thoughts and increase direct communication with financial consumers and markets. The FSS has set up five objectives for this year’s supervisory guidelines and they are as follows. 
1.Stabilizing Financial System 
In its efforts to better brace for worsening global and domestic conditions including euro-zone debt crisis, the FSS will strengthen foreign currency liquidity management and encourage financial companies to have more ability to absorb losses by setting aside more loan loss provisions.
2.Protecting Financial Consumers
The FSS will earthen unreasonable practices embedded across the financial sector to correct them, and conduct more mystery shopping for five financial instruments that frequently incur losses to consumers.
3.Protecting Low-income People and SMEs
The FSS will intensify crackdown on illegal financial acts against low-income people and help reduce financial difficulties of SMEs by creating a level playing field between large companies and SMEs.
4.Innovating Supervisory System
Financial companies will be encouraged to bring their corporate governance in line with global standards and place a high premium on corporate social responsibility. The FSS will help attract global financial companies to domestic market and give support to domestic companies making inroads into global markets.
5.Open-minded Communications with Market Players 
The FSS will press ahead with a comprehensive overhaul of the supervisory framework and better communication with consumers to restore confidence.

Jimena Díaz

Doña Jimena Díaz (also spelled Ximena) (c.1054–c.1115) was the wife of El Cid from 1074 and her husband's successor as ruler of Valencia from 1099 to 1102. She had four children with El Cid, and one of them died with their father on the battlefield.
Biography.
Jimena was the daughter of Diego Fernández, Count of Oviedo and son of Count Fernando Flaínez, and his wife Cristina. She was a sister of Fernando Díaz.
Upon marrying Rodrigo Díaz, Jimena Díaz accompanied her husband although it has remained unclear if she lived with him in the Taifa of Zaragoza during his first exile (from 1080-1086) as leader of the Andalusian army in service of Ahmah al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud, and Al-Mustain II. There is also little historical certainty as to whether or not she moved with him in this period to Asturias, although there exists some documentation to suggest that she maintained a presence even during periods of separation (a legal action from Tol in 1083).
At the beginning of the second exile of the Cid, in 1089, Jimena was imprisoned with her children, Cristina (born around 1075), Diego (1076?) and María (1077?) by mandate of Alfonso VI of León and Castile. Nothing else is known about Jimena until the end of 1094, when Rodrigo Díaz, on October 21, winning the battle of Cuarte, secured his control over Valencia (that he had conquered on June 17 of that year) and she was reunited with her husband until his death in 1099.
From this point she was Lady of Valencia until 1102 when Alfonso VI, her cousin, decided to set fire to and abandon the city to the Almoravids in response to the impossibility of defending it. Alfonso VI escorted Jimena in her return to Castile. Around this period there remains a document of donation made by Jimena Díaz to the Cathedral of Valencia in 1101 containing her signature.
In 1103 she signed a document in the Monastery of San Pedro of Cardeña for the sale of a monastery that she owned to two canons of Burgos, although this fact does not mean that Jimena would have lived in the abbey during her old age, as was the legend maintained by the monastery until the 18th century in the hagiographic texts known as The Legend of Cardeña. More likely is that she lived her last years in Burgos or in a nearby outlying area. She died sometime between August 29 of 1113 and 1116, probably in that final year.

Philippe Suchard

Philippe Suchard (9 October 1797 – 14 January 1884) was a Swiss chocolatier and industrialist.
Biography.
Suchard was born in 1797 in Boudry. According to the memoirs of his sister Rosalie, he became aware of the potentialities of chocolate manufacturing as an industry at the very early age of about twelve. To fulfill his dream, six years later he started as an apprentice in his brother Frédéric's "Konditorei" in Bern. In 1824 he left Switzerland to visit the United States. At the end of the year he returned and opened a confectioner's business in Neuchâtel. In 1826, Suchard opened the factory of Chocolat Suchard in Serrières. He used hydropower of the nearby river to run the mills in his two-man factory. Suchard used a grinding mill consisting of a heated granite plate, and several granite rollers moving forwards and backwards. This design is still used to grind cocoa paste.
Chocolate was not cheap or a product for everybody. Suchard struggled financially early in his career as a chocolatier. His success came in 1842, with a bulk order from Frederick William IV, king of Prussia, who was also the prince of Neuchâtel. This triggered a boom and soon his chocolates won prizes at the London Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855. He opened his first factory abroad in 1880 in Lörrach, Germany, becoming the first to do so. The unusual purple color of the chocolate packaging was selected by Suchard, who believed it would be unique among chocolate packaging. By the end of the 19th century, Suchard had become the largest chocolate producer. Seventeen years after his death in 1884 in Neuchâtel, his company produced the famous Milka chocolate for the Swiss market. After his death, his daughter Eugénie Suchard and her husband Karl Russ-Suchard, took over the functioning of his factory. Nowadays the factory belongs to the Kraft Foods group and production has been moved to the Toblerone factory in Bern.
Other interests.
Suchard was not only a chocolatier but also had interest in other areas. In 1834 he introduced and captained the first steamer, "Industriel", on Lake Neuchâtel. He also tried introducing silkworm culture in Switzerland in 1837, but the silkworms were destroyed during an epidemic in 1843. His interest in managing river water and controlling floods led to the sinking of the water level in Lake Neuchâtel. The lowered lake shoreline revealed the Celtic settlement of La Tène dating back to around 450 BC.

Rotes Kliff lighthouse

The Rotes Kliff lighthouse on the island of Sylt, Germany, served as a sector light from 1913 to 1975. It is located on a cliffside north of the village of Kampen.
History.
The lighthouse was built between 1912 and 1913 as a sector light to warn ships of a sand bank in the approach to the "Lister Tief" nautical channel and to have a supplement to the main light at Kampen, 2.5 kilometres to the south. It became operational in 1913 and was electrified in 1936. Until its deactivation in 1975 it was maintained by the keepers of the Kampen lighthouse. When "Rotes Kliff" was extinguished, the main light at Kampen took over its part with a red section of light. Today the tower serves as a daymark without any lighting facility and is owned by the Kampen municipality who financed a restoration of the tower in 1993.

<doc id="19217866" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19217866" title="Benzaldehyde">
Benzaldehyde

Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring with a formyl substituent. It is the simplest aromatic aldehyde and one of the most industrially useful. This colorless liquid has a characteristic pleasant almond-like odor. In fact, benzaldehyde is the primary component of bitter almond oil and can be extracted from a number of other natural sources. Benzaldehyde was first extracted from bitter almonds in 1803 by the French pharmacist Martrès. In 1832 German chemists Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig first synthesized benzaldehyde.
Production.
Benzaldehyde can be obtained by many processes. In the 1980s, an estimated 18 million kilograms were produced annually in Japan, Europe, and North America, a level that can be assumed to continue. Currently liquid phase chlorination and oxidation of toluene are the main routes. Numerous other methods have been developed, such as the partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol, alkali hydrolysis of benzal chloride, and the carbonylation of benzene.
Benzaldehyde can be synthesized from cinnamaldehyde obtained from the oil of cinnamon by refluxing in aqueous/alcoholic solution between 90 °C and 150 °C with a base (most commonly sodium carbonate or bicarbonate) for 5 to 80 hours, followed by distillation of the formed benzaldehyde. This reaction also yields acetaldehyde.
Occurrence.
Almonds, apricots, apples and cherry kernels, contain significant amounts of amygdalin. This glycoside breaks up under enzyme catalysis into benzaldehyde, hydrocyanic acid and two molecules of glucose. 
Reactions.
On oxidation, benzaldehyde is converted into the odorless benzoic acid, which is a common impurity in laboratory samples. Benzyl alcohol can be formed from benzaldehyde by means of hydrogenation. Reaction of benzaldehyde with anhydrous sodium acetate and acetic anhydride yields cinnamic acid, while alcoholic potassium cyanide can be used to catalyze the condensation of benzaldehyde to benzoin. Benzaldehyde undergoes disproportionation upon treatment with concentrated alkali (Cannizzaro reaction): one molecule of the aldehyde is reduced to the corresponding alcohol and another molecule is simultaneously oxidized to sodium benzoate.
Uses.
It is commonly employed to confer almond flavor. Benzaldehyde is used chiefly as a precursor to other organic compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals to plastic additives. The aniline dye malachite green is prepared from benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline. It is a precursor to certain acridine dyes as well. Via aldol condensations, benzaldehyde is converted into derivatives of cinnamaldehyde and styrene. The synthesis of mandelic acid starts from benzaldehyde:
First hydrocyanic acid is added to benzaldehyde, and the resulting nitrile is subsequently hydrolysed to mandelic acid. (The scheme above depicts only one of the two formed enantiomers).
Glaciologists LaChapelle and Stillman reported in 1966 that benzaldehyde and N-heptaldehyde inhibit the recrystallization of snow and therefore the formation of depth hoar. This treatment may prevent avalanches caused by unstable depth hoar layers. However, the chemicals are not in widespread use because they damage vegetation and contaminate water supplies.
Safety.
Benzaldehyde has been classified as a hazardous substance by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Stephen Fry's Podgrams

"Stephen Fry's Podgrams" is a series of podcasts performed and recorded by British comedian and author Stephen Fry. First made downloadable on 20 February 2008, the series of podgrams is a collection of Fry's writings, speeches and collective thoughts. The podgrams vary in length and are not released at any set date.
The podgrams are one of the most downloaded podcast series on the internet, and have appeared in the top five most downloaded podcasts from iTunes. Critical reception has been positive, as reviewers have found the podgrams interesting and engaging.
Content.
The subject of "Stephen Fry's Podgrams" differs from episode to episode. Normally, each podgram begins with an update from Fry about what he has been doing recently, his activities since the last podgram, and any housekeeping that he needs to do concerning his website, www.stephenfry.com. Fry then continues to discuss his recent activities; although in other editions the introduction leads in to the main subject. The text of the podgrams is sometimes published as part of Fry's web logs, or "Blessays".
Fry's podgrams consist of anecdotes, such as how he broke his arm while filming a documentary in Brazil. He has also presented lectures, discussed certain themes in detail, or argued against things he sees as being wrong in today's society. In discussing his hatred of dancing, he said of music, "I do not want to use it as an exercise track for a farcical, meaningless, disgusting, brainless physical public exhibition of windmilling, gyrating and thrashing in a hot, loud room or hall." The material is usually original for each podcast, but he may revisit topics that he has previously discussed. For example, one podgram consisted of a speech he had previously made concerning public service broadcasting. His apologetic explanation for the repeated subject matter described his busy life, and he stated that the podgram was "all I can offer you."
Reception.
"Stephen Fry's Podgrams" have been well received by critics. The series has been in the list of the top five most downloaded podcasts on iTunes, even though only a few episodes have been made so far.
Chris Campling of "The Times" said that Fry was smug, "but then he has a lot to be smug about, not least the ability to waffle for 30 to 45 minutes about not very much without being boring or condescending." The Good Web Guide also recommends the series, saying that "whether he is bringing you up to date with his recent adventures of just riffing on something that interests him, he is always compelling company." The guide also states, "Stephen Fry is one of those very rare people who are incapable of being boring."
Jacques René Zammit of "The Malta Independent" reviewed one episode in which Fry talked about the problems within journalism. Zammit wrote positively on Fry's comments saying, "I share Stephen's worries completely. Every time I sit down to type my excessively long column, I am burdened by the thought that after all this is just a collection of thoughts by someone who may very well be perceived as a pompous ass – and if Stephen Fry has these disquisitions, then I definitely should be doing some worrying myself."
Episodes.
The podgrams are released sporadically, with gaps between different podgrams being from one month up to several months. The length of each podgram varies widely as well. The second series began after Fry's website was revamped.

1943 Mazatlán hurricane

The 1943 Mazatlán hurricane was a powerful tropical cyclone that lashed the southern coast of Sinaloa on the morning of 9 October 1943. The hurricane went essentially undetected before it made landfall just south of Mazatlán on 9 October with a pressure below and maximum sustained winds of at least . The hurricane destroyed two small towns and half of Mazatlán, killing at least 106 persons, injuring 102, and leaving over 1,000 homeless. Total damage was estimated at $4.5 million (1943 USD, $56 million 2008 USD). The hurricane was the strongest on record to strike Mazatlán.
Meteorological history.
Sources do not reveal the exact origin of this tropical cyclone. On 8 October, a developing tropical cyclone passed between the Revillagigedo Islands and Islas Marías. It moved rapidly northeastward and arrived on the coast of Sinaloa as an intense hurricane. 
Mazatlán Observatory reported that the atmospheric pressure began dropping at 1:30 am on 9 October and fell in 8 hours, and reached a minimum of . At 1530 UTC 9 October, the hurricane made landfall just south of Mazatlán. At 9:30 am, the observatory reported winds of for a period of 15 minutes, which period ended when the wind blew the anemometer loose. The hurricane ranks as the strongest on record to strike the city. 
The storm dropped little precipitation as it passed Mazatlán, but fell on the afternoon of 9 October. 
As the storm continued inland, it rapidly weakened and apparently dissipated over the Sierra Madre Occidental. The storm apparently passed into Chihuahua and was predicted to continue into the southern United States, though the remainder of its path is unknown.
The cyclone was dissipated over the state of Durango within a day after landfall. Heavy rain developed across parts of Texas on 12/13 October 1943. 
Effects and aftermath.
Moving ashore as a powerful hurricane, the storm destroyed the small towns of El Roble, now in Mazatlán Municipality, and Palmillas. The storm partially destroyed Villa Unión (a town now in Mazatlán Municipality) and severely damaged the port at Mazatlán. In these towns, approximately 100 persons lost their lives. Though the storm was reported to have struck "without warning", most residents in the destroyed cities ably reached safety in higher ground. The hurricane destroyed about half of the buildings in Mazatlán, and near the ocean, the combination of strong waves, high winds, and rainfall heavily damaged many hotels and houses. The storm damaged water systems, leaving people without potable water or sewage systems. In a portion of the coastline, the storm severely impacted the communication and transportation infrastructure. The airport at Mazatlán sustained damage to its radio tower, and for at least 18 hours, the only communication between the city and the rest of Mexico was through the radio of a plane in the airport. Total damage was estimated at $4.5 million (1943 USD, $56 million 2008 USD).
Of several fishing boats and a small Mexican Navy vessel caught in the storm, no trace reportedly was found; all persons aboard these vessels apparently died. A small coastal boat arrived in the port of Mazatlán after the storm and reported six crew members missing. 
Within two days after the storm, the death toll rose to 18; the next day, the Associated Press reported 52 deaths and 102 injuries. Ten days after the storm, military officials reported the death toll rose to 57, and the number of people left homeless by the storm reached over 1,000. 
By 24 hours after the storm, President Manuel Ávila Camacho ordered nurses and doctors on standby, and for military workers in the area to prepare to assist in the aftermath. By five days after the storm, officials had restored power and communications in the area. Around the same time, the president issued an appeal for public donations for storm victims. Within a week, citizens sent large quantities of food, clothing, and medicine to the worst affected areas.

Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau

Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau (1769 – 1832) was a French Navy soldier and an adventurer who played an important role in Vietnam in the 19th century. He served the Nguyễn Dynasty from 1794 to 1819, and 1821 to 1826, and took the Vietnamese name of Nguyễn Văn Thắng (阮文勝).
Role in Vietnam.
Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau was among the soldiers who were gathered by Father Pigneau de Béhaine to support the efforts of Nguyễn Phúc Ánh to conquer Vietnam. He came to Vietnam with Pigneau in 1794. Chaigneau supported the offensives of Nguyễn Ánh, such as the 1801 naval offensive in Thi Nai.
Once Nguyễn Ánh became emperor Gia Long, Chaigneau remained at the court to become a mandarin. Chaigneau received the tiltle of "truong co", together with Philippe Vannier, de Forsans and Despiau, meaning second-class second-degree military mandarins, and later received the title of Grand Mandarin once Gia Long became emperor, with personal escorts of 50 soldiers. He also married into a Vietnamese Catholic mandarin family, as did Vannier or Laurent Barizy. He married Ho Thi Hue, of the Ho Catholic family.
Chaigneau became a Counsellor to Emperor Gia Long under the Vietnamese name of Nguyen Van Thang. From 1816, he was in relation with the French Foreign Minister Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu.
Chaigneau then traveled to France on the "Henri" in 1819, and returned to Vietnam in 1821, as the French consul in Huế (he was the first French Consul in Cochinchina), with mission to obtain more trade privileges for France. He offered to emperor Minh Mạng a peace treaty with France, but this was rejected. Discouraged, he left Vietnam in 1824.
In 1826, his nephew Eugène Chaigneau was sent to Vietnam to replace him as Consul, but Eugène was denied any audience with Minh Mạng.
Chaigneau had a son, Nguyen Van Duc, also known as Michel Duc Chaigneau, who wrote a memoir on his early life in Huế ("Souvenirs de Huế") and played a role in the embassy of Phan Thanh Gian to France in 1863. In France, he became a commissioner for the Ministry of Finance. Another of his sons, Jean Chaigneau, also a half-Vietnamese, later became secretary general of the city of Rennes.
Depictions.
Two depictions of Chaigneau are known: one in which he wears rather Westernized clothing, which is actually a paintover of an original painting in which he wears distinctly Vietnamese clothing, which was discovered underneath after restoration. The original painting, probably painted around 1805 when Chaigneau was about 35, is strongly reminiscent of the uniforms worn by the armies of the soldiers of Emperor Gia Long. Beneath his blue jacket, Chaigneau wears a full Vietnamese dress of red color, with small flowers (visible on the pair of throusers) which suggests a member of the Imperial family (as other French officers, Chaigneau apparently received the honnour of being considered a part of the Imperial family). The roll he wears in his right probably indicates the Madarinal roll he received from the emperor.

Russian submarine Forel

Forel (, - Trout) was a midget submarine designed by Raimondo Lorenzo D’Equevilley-Montjustin and by built by Krupp in Kiel, Germany. The design was an experimental design built as a private venture by Krupp in hopes of attracting a contract from the Imperial German Navy. Although the design proved moderately successful, the submarine did not attract German naval attention. 
Design.
Forelle was a single-hull boat designed with internal ballast and compensating tanks. She had fixed angled aft planes, and movable forward units for dive control. This boat had to be carried into action on board a surface ship and launched close to its target, as she was not fitted with a separate surface propulsion system. She was equipped with two Whitehead torpedoes.
Operational history.
The Imperial Russian Navy purchased the submarine in May 1904 for service in the Russo-Japanese War. It was shipped from Kiel to Liepāja by railway, together with a team of German engineers to train the Russian crew, and was commissioned at Kronstadt on 21 August 1904. It was then sent via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok, arriving on 29 September, and joined the Siberian Flotilla on 2 October, becoming the first Russian submarine in the Pacific. Although the submarine did not see combat during the Russo-Japanese War, its presence had an important psychological effect.
"Forel" continued to operate out of Vladivostok after the war; however, by 1908 it was considered obsolete and was re-classed as a training vessel. The submarine sank in an accident on 17 May 1910. The crew managed to escape, and the ship was salvaged from a depth of . Vice Admiral Ivan Grigorovich authorized it to be returned to Liepāja for repairs, but shipping was never implemented.

Kuzhal Pattu

Kuzhal pattu is a form of traditional temple music practised in the Kerala state of India. It centers around the use of the kuzhal, a double reed wind instrument, and is typically performed at temple festivals.
Structure.
In kuzhal pattu, the kuzhal plays the lead with the support of several accompanying instruments, which may include chenda (both treble and bass), ilathalam, toppi maddalam and a sruti (drone) kuzhal. A Kuzhal Pattu typically starts with the lead kuzhal essaying an alapanam to establish a raga. The other instruments may join in as the kuzhal pattu progresses through several ragas and compositions. The span of the musical form ranges from five minutes to over an hour, with an average length of 30 minutes.
Performance.
Kuzhal pattu is typically used as a prelude to panchari melam, but may also be played prior to night seevelis (temple circumambulations) that perform panchavadyam. It is usually performed inside the temple before midnight. The kuzhal pattu is generally played in an elaborate way at temple festivals around Thrissur and Valluvanad areas, but it isn't very uncommon in other parts of Kerala as well.

Numbered street

A numbered street is a street whose name is an Ordinal number, as in "Second Street" or "Tenth Avenue". Such forms are among the most common street names in North America, but also exist in other parts of the world, especially in the Middle East. Numbered streets were first used in Philadelphia and now exist in many major cities and small towns. Grid-based naming systems usually start at 1 (but sometimes at a higher number or even at zero), and then proceed in numerical order. In the United States, seven out of the top ten most common street names are numbers, with the top three names being "2nd," "3rd," and "1st" respectively.
Some cities also have "lettered" street names. For example, Washington, D.C., in addition to having numbered streets, also has streets identified as a letter followed by "Street," going as high as the letter W. New York City (mostly in Brooklyn) has avenues titled "Avenue" followed by the respective letter of the alphabet, such as Avenue D. The idea for such a system was developed by Pierre Charles L’Enfant, who devised the system for Washington.
The numbered street system is criticized for taking away the individuality from a community that a named street would provide.
By place.
United States.
Philadelphia.
Central Philadelphia was laid out by Thomas Holme in 1683 and was the first city to use numbered streets systematically. While the original plan had two sets of north-south numbered streets, one parallel to the Delaware River and one to the Schuylkill, all are now numbered from the Delaware, with numbers increasing westward. First Street has been known as Front Street, and Fourteenth Street as Broad Street, since the founding of the city. The highest numbered street is 90th Street. In Southwest Philadelphia, the grid is oblique, with numbered streets running from northwest to southeast. The numerical sequence is consistent with the numbering in adjacent West Philadelphia, and still increases from east to west. Because of the twist, however, the sequence is not consistent with the numbering in South Philadelphia, across the Schuylkill River.
The Kensington area has streets lettered "A" through "O". The East Oak Lane and West Oak Lane sections of the city contains east-west streets numbered from 64th Avenue to 80th Avenue, with the numbers correspondent with the block numbers north from Market Street.
In the early 20th century, many of Chestnut Hill's previously numbered streets were renamed for Native American tribes.
New York City.
The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 laid out the grid that covers most of Manhattan today. Most east-west streets (which actually run southeast-northwest) are named "___th Street", and a few major north-south streets (which actually run northeast-southwest, roughly parallel to the island's long axis) are named "___th Avenue".
The highest-numbered street on Manhattan Island is 220th Street, and the highest-numbered street in the Borough of Manhattan is 228th Street.
The Manhattan numbered street grid continues north in The Bronx, where the highest numbered street is West 262nd Street on the border of Yonkers. The only numbered avenue in The Bronx is a continuation of Manhattan's Third Avenue.
In Queens, the melding of various grids from pre-consolidation villages resulted in repeat numbers, for example 67th Street, 67th Place, 67th Avenue, 67th Road and 67th Drive. Streets and places run north to south, while avenues, roads and drives run east to west. The Avenues run from Third Avenue in Whitestone to 165th Avenue in Howard Beach. Streets run from First Street in Astoria to 271st Street in Floral Park.
In Brooklyn, there are ten sets of numbered streets (unprefixed numbered streets as well as North, South, East, West, Bay, Brighton, Paerdegat, Plumb, and Flatlands numbered streets), along with numbered avenues up to 28th Avenue and letter avenues up to Avenue Z. Manhattan's Alphabet City consists of Avenues A through D.
The Rockaways section of Queens has streets prefixed with the word "Beach". However, street signs in this area typically identify this prefix using only the letter B (e.g. "B 116 St"). The neighborhood of Broad Channel also has its own network of numbered roads, prefixed with East or West, relative to Cross Bay Boulevard.
The closest cross street to a given building number in Manhattan can be estimated using the Manhattan address algorithm.
The highest-numbered street in all of the New York area is 271st Street, located in Floral Park, Queens. The highest-numbered Avenue in Manhattan is the very obscure 13th Avenue, on Gansevoort Peninsula in the Hudson River just north of Gansevoort Street. Currently, only one unmarked block remains, currently used as a garbage truck access behind the Bloomfield Street Sanitation Depot. The street was once longer, but much of the land it was built on was removed to provide longer piers for berthing larger ships, such as the RMS Lusitania and RMS Titanic, without protruding further into the Hudson River. 12th Avenue is the highest numbered avenue that is signed by the city and accessible to the public. Higher-numbered avenues exist in other boroughs.
Sixth and a Half Avenue, is the only numbered avenue in Manhattan with the name that involves fractions.
Washington, D.C..
Pierre L'Enfant's plan for Washington, D.C. includes both radial avenues and grid system consisting of both numbered and lettered streets. North-south streets are named with numbers, such as "7th Street," and west-east streets are named with letters, such as "H Street." The name is then followed with a directional suffix (NW, NE, SW, or SE), specifying a quadrant of the city (e.g. 16th Street Northwest. The quadrants meet at the U.S. Capitol building.
Within the city, the quadrants are divided by three streets known as "North", "East", and "South" Capitol Streets, and by the National Mall, which takes the place of the non-existent "West Capitol Street". Numbers start counting upward on either side of North and South Capitol Streets, and letters start counting upward on either side of East Capitol Street and the National Mall.
Baltimore.
The city of Baltimore, Maryland, has numbered streets in the north-central part of the city. The numbered streets in Baltimore do not begin with 1, but rather start with 20th Street just north of and parallel to North Avenue, the former northern boundary of the city, and what is viewed by many today is the northern boundary of Downtown Baltimore. The numbered streets, which go as high as 43rd Street, correspond with the first two digits in the addresses of the north-south streets they cross. Unlike in Washington, where the numbered streets run north-south, Baltimore's numbered streets run west-east. All begin their names with either "West" or "East," depending on which side of Charles Street the block is located.
Some of Baltimore's numbered streets are well known for various reasons. 28th and 29th streets, a one-way pair, are the only numbered streets to have an interchange with I-83. They use the numbered designations to the east of the expressway, and to the west, they merge into a six-lane road known as Druid Park Lake Drive. East 33rd Street was the location of the now-demolished Memorial Stadium, home to the Baltimore Orioles for 38 years and the Baltimore Colts for 31. West 34th Street is the location of the annual Miracle on 34th Street, where residents on one block of the street open their porches to tourists to view their holiday decorations. West 40th Street is the location of The Rotunda shopping mall, and it merges into West 41st Street, which crosses over (but does not have an interchange with) I-83 into Television Hill and is the only numbered street in the city west of I-83.
Chicago.
The City of Chicago is set on a grid with eight "standard" city blocks per mile. Some blocks are further divided in half. A standard block has 100 address numbers, meaning there are 800 numbers per mile. Chicago address numbering begins downtown at State Street and Madison Street; State Street is 0 east and west, and Madison Street is 0 north and south. Major streets a mile apart have address numbers that, for the most part, are multiples of 800.
The south side of the city uses numbered east-west streets, although older streets that were already named retained their names, particularly in the Loop. As stated above, Chicago house numbers are generally assigned at the rate of 8 blocks to a mile. The only exceptions are from Madison to 31st Street, just south of downtown.
Roosevelt Road (previously Twelfth St) is one mile south of Madison with 12 blocks to the mile, Cermak Road (previously 22nd Street) is two miles south of Madison with 10 blocks to the mile, and 31st Street (3100 S) is three miles south of Madison with 9 blocks to the mile. South of 31st Street, the pattern of 8 blocks to the mile resumes, with 39th Street the next major street, 47th after that, and so on.
The numbering within Chicago is continued throughout many suburbs south of the city proper. For instance, Chicago Heights has a 185th Street, set on the same numbering schema.
Chicago's numbered street system was adopted in 1911 as a result of new legislation. Madison Street was made the base for all street numbering, and State Street for north-south streets.
Cleveland.
As a general rule, the only numbered streets in Cleveland run—generally—north-south, while streets that run parallel to the lake shore (generally east-west) have names rather than numbers. Ontario Street in downtown Cleveland separates east- and west-numbered streets, with the numbers increasing as one travels further away from Ontario. Conforming east-west roads are given a name, rather than a number, and the suffix "Avenue." Where an avenue crosses Ontario street or the Cuyahoga River, its name changes, meaning that a numbered street does not intersect a given avenue more than once. For example, stating a location as "65th and Detroit" implies West 65th street, since Detroit Avenue changes to Superior Avenue when it crosses the river. Non-conforming streets are suffixed with names other than "street" or "avenue," e.g., West Boulevard, Old River Road, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Geographic idiosyncrasies in certain parts of the city mean that this is by no means an absolute rule, but generally applies 95% of the time when within the city proper.
Greater Miami/Florida.
In Greater Miami, numbered streets go into three digits, with varying, overlapping sets of numbered streets. The area has roads that are named as a number followed by "Street" that run west-east, and a number followed by "Avenue" that run north-south. All these streets start their names with NW, NE, SW, or SE, depending where they are in relation to the center of Miami.
In the Miami suburbs, some numbered streets and avenues are paired with a parallel "Court", "Drive", "Place" or "Terrace"; while in the same area, other sets of numbered streets and avenues exist with lower numbers such as shown here. This is known to lead to confusion among some, especially non-locals.
Similar numbering systems are used throughout the state of Florida, such as in Gainesville, Ocala, Panama City, and Jacksonville.
Detroit.
In the northern suburbs of Detroit, "___ Mile Road" runs east-west, a stated number of miles from the center of Detroit. Some of these roads are also known by other names. The lowest numbered road is 5 Mile Road, while the city limits end at 8 Mile Road. The highest such numbered road is 38 Mile Road, which is mostly in Almont.
The city of Detroit also has some conventional numbered streets within the city limits.
San Francisco.
San Francisco has two numbered series: First Street through 30th Street in South-of-Market and the Mission district, and Second Avenue through 48th Avenue in the Richmond and Sunset districts, with 48th nearest the Pacific Ocean. (The street that would be First Avenue is named Arguello Boulevard, and Funston Avenue replaces Thirteenth Avenue, although Thirteenth Street exists.) Unlike Manhattan, the numbered Streets and Avenues do not meet; but, because of a bend in the pattern, Third Street meets 16th through 26th Streets.
These are the only numbered streets in San Francisco whose signs include the "St." or "Ave." designation.
Denver.
Denver has two systems in place in two distinct areas of the city. Downtown Denver's diagonal street system technically begins with 4th Street near Auraria Campus, underneath the Colfax Avenue viaduct. The system then counts up northeastward from 4th Street to 40th Street. The diagonal system meets the normal numbered grid at various points, with the termination of the downtown system at 40th Avenue and 40th Street in the Five Points neighborhood.
The second system is a typical East/West layout, with directional indicators. First Avenue is adjacent to Ellsworth Avenue in Central Denver; the series extends to 168th Avenue in unincorporated Adams County. Exceptions include Colfax Avenue, which takes the place of 15th Avenue, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which generally takes the place of East 32nd Avenue. The designations "East" and "North" are generally not used unless needed. Building numbers on cross-streets reflect the street numbering; for example, 1800 Colorado Boulevard would be at the corner of 18th Avenue. (1800 South Colorado Boulevard is outside the area of numbered streets.)
Canada.
Calgary.
The city of Calgary uses a quadrant system with a grid set. The east-west demarcation line separating the north and south is the Bow River west of Nose Creek, Centre Avenue directly east of Nose Creek, and Memorial Drive east of 36th Street. The north-south line is Centre Street. Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west; both are numbered beginning at the demarcation lines. Many older areas also have "A" and "B" streets interspersed between the numbered streets; for instance, in most older neighbourhoods the street directly west of Centre Street is 1st Street, but a Centre A Street runs for short distances in certain areas. Suburban neighbourhoods built since approximately 1971 tend to have named streets except in cases where numbered streets extend into the district. A typical (if fictional) street address in an older district would be "4214-19A Street SW". As such, addresses of buildings on numbered streets are worthless without a quadrant.
The grid is based on the Dominion Land Survey, with many of the main roads in the older areas of town (such as Crowchild Trail SW and 17th Avenue SE) following the lines that separate one DLS section from another ("section lines").
Streets and avenues directly outside the city are sometimes numbered as they would be if they were in the city. The impetus for this came originally from emergency response groups, such as fire departments and police.
Edmonton.
The city of Edmonton's grid system is similar to that of Calgary's except that the two roads designated the "centre" of Edmonton were numbered 100th Avenue and 100th Street. This was done to eliminate any possibility that the city would have quadrants as Calgary does. The expansion of the city has however made this possibility a reality; the city now extends south and east of what would normally be Centre Street and Centre Avenue. As such, most of the city is officially said to be in the northwest quadrant, but common use is to not use the quadrant unless the address is both on a numbered street and not in the northwest.
Metro Vancouver.
A grid system of numbered streets and avenues is used south of the Fraser River, in the municipalities of Delta, Surrey and Langley. Avenues run east-west and are numbered starting with 0 ("Zero") avenue next to the Canada-U.S. Border and going north, with the numbers incrementing each mile (200 metres). Streets run north-south and are numbered starting with zero lying in the Strait of Georgia and going east, with the numbers incrementing each mile, just like the avenues. Minor streets named with a number followed by a letter (136A Street, 136B street) are situated between the numbers.
The city of Vancouver proper uses its own road numbering system, numbering east-west avenues from first at False Creek and incrementing south. Similarly, the city of New Westminster has its own numbering system with avenues northeast-southwest and streets northwest-southeast.
Other Canadian cities and towns.
Many small towns and cities in Western Canada use numbered streets. Some begin numbering at Centre as Calgary does, but others follow Edmonton's example and begin numbering at 1, 50, or 100. Examples include Brandon, Manitoba, where streets, running north-south, are numbered; and Red Deer, Alberta, where numbered streets run east-west, and numbered avenues run north-south. In Saskatoon, Saskatchewan only the streets, running east-west, are numbered (aside from avenues downtown, which are numbered from 1st to 10th); there are lettered avenues to the west of Idylwyld Drive, which was formerly known as Avenue A (a stub of Avenue A does remain south of 20th Street though). Streets in the Sutherland district in Saskatoon are numbered 101 St to 117 St. This was done when the town of Sutherland amalgamated with Saskatoon, to avoid confusion with Saskatoon's numbered streets, which run from 1 to 71. Owen Sound, Ontario, in Eastern Canada, also has numbered streets and avenues. New Toronto also has numbered streets, running westward off of Lake Shore Boulevard, starting at 1st Street (just west of Royal York Road), to 43rd Street, excluding Eighteenth Street and Thirty-Fourth Street, as Kipling Avenue and the The Long Branch Avenue replace them, respectively.
Numerous street numbering schemes were proposed for the various municipalities originally making up Greater Winnipeg, but most were quickly rescinded, as the city is not built on a grid and numbering was considered unwieldy. Only one roadway (Fifth Avenue in St. Vital) retains its "number", but the street name is legally the word "Fifth" and not the number. Numbered roadways are also found within CFB Winnipeg, but the street names within the base were chosen by the Department of National Defence and not by the city itself.
Germany.
Mannheim.
A notable European example is the city of Mannheim where blocks are numbered in a grid-like system since 1811, and streets actually don't have names anymore - for example the houses in "street" B7 are those in the block in grid B7. The houses on the other side of the street belong to other blocks and therefore have another street name.
Iran.
Tehran.
In Tehran are multiple sets of numbered streets running from west to east in various sections of the north side of town. In many such sections, the street numbers count upward by two, with even-numbered streets on one side of a neighborhood, and odd-numbered streets on the other. The highest numbered street is 304th Street. The city also has other series of streets with a name combining with a number.
United Arab Emirates.
In United Arab Emirates, most streets and roads are numbered. Most commonly in smaller cities, they are identified with a 4-digit number followed by "way."
Abu Dhabi.
Abu Dhabi has even-numbered streets running west-east, and odd-numbered streets running north-south.
Dubai.
Dubai has numbered streets that simply have the number followed by "street" (e.g. 41st Street), as well as streets named with a number followed by a letter (23 B Street).
Cuba.
Havana.
Havana has even-numbered streets running north-south, and odd-numbered streets running east-west on the west side of the city, with lettered streets from A through P running north-south beginning on the east side of Paseo Ave. Some streets are named with a number followed by a letter (23 B Street).

Wind the Bobbin Up

"Wind The Bobbin Up" is an English language children's nursery rhyme and singing game. 
Lyrics.
Among modern lyrics is:
Origins.
Iona and Peter Opie traced this rhyme back to Yorkshire in the 1890s. When they were collecting games in the 1960s and 70s the version they encountered was:
The game.
In the 1970s the game involved two players winding fists around each other. At "Pull, Pull" they pushed their fists away from each other and when "Tug, Tug" was reached they pulled their elbows back. It has now become a much more sedate action game, often with small children carrying out the actions in the lyrics.

Russian submarine Pochtovy

Pochtovy () was a submarine built for the Imperial Russian Navy. The boat was designed by Drzewiecki and built at the Metal Works St Petersburg in 1908. She was funded by Public subscription.
This ship's machinery was a novel attempt at Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) using gasoline engines with oxygen supplied by pressurised cylinders. Forty-five cylinders containing of air at 2500 psi could give the boat a submerged range. The exhaust gasses were vented via perforated pipe under the keel. The system proved reliable in trials but condensation problems and the tell-tale wake produced by the exhaust resulted in no further development and the boat was stricken in 1913.

Maxim Petrov

Maxim Vladimirovich Petrov (; born 1965) is a Russian doctor and serial killer. He is currently serving a life sentence for killing 12 patients. The Russian media nicknamed him "Doctor Killer" and "Doctor Death".
Crimes.
Between 1997 and 2000 Petrov, who lived on Vasilievsky Island in St Petersburg, committed 47 robberies. He would visit a patient at their home, unannounced, and usually in the morning when relatives would be at work. He would then measure their blood pressure and suggest they needed an injection. He anaesthetised them and while they were then unconscious, stole their possessions, even taking rings and earrings from the victims' bodies. The first few victims did not die, waking up later after he had left. The first murder took place on 2 February 1999, during his thirtieth robbery. He was interrupted when the daughter of an anaesthetised patient returned home while he was stealing possessions. He stabbed her with a screwdriver and then strangled the patient with a stocking. After this, his modus operandi changed; he began to inject his victims with a lethal mix of a variety of different drugs, so that the police would think that the killer had little medical knowledge. He then set fire to their homes to destroy any evidence. Various possessions were later found in his flat, though he had already sold others at the market.
The police did not release a photofit of the suspect, thinking he would soon be caught. However, it took until 2000 for them to realise how the victims were being selected. All were included in the same list of lung patients who had undergone a fluorography, which he found in a local health centre. Using this list, they identified 72 possible future victims in an operation called "Medbrat" ("Male Nurse"), involving 700 police officers. They arrested Petrov when he visited one of the patients on 17 January 2000.
On his arrest, Petrov admitted to the murders, but recanted his confession a few months later, blaming it on the intense psychological pressure he had endured while in custody.
Trial.
Petrov was suspected of 19 murders but tried for just 17 in 2002. He was found guilty of 12. Six patients were also seriously injured. He was sentenced by judge Valentina Kudriashova to life in prison.
Personal life.
At the time of his arrest, Petrov was married and had three children: one from a first marriage and two from his second.

Robert G. Emmens

Robert G. Emmens (July 22, 1914 - April 2, 1992) was a Doolittle Raider and a career United States Air Force officer.
Biography.
Emmens graduated from Medford High School, Medford, Oregon in 1931. He then attended University of Oregon, 1931 - 1934. Emmens entered the United States Army Air Corps on February 23, 1937 at Vancouver Barracks, Washington. Graduated from Flying Training School with a rating of pilot, February, 1938. Assigned to 17th Bomb Group at March Field, California.
As a first lieutenant, Emmens joined the Tokyo mission just before the mission. he was a co-pilot on one of the 16 B-25 Mitchell bombers under the command of Colonel James H. Doolittle that were left the carrier USS Hornet (CV-8) to carry out the Tokyo raid on April 18, 1942. Emmens B-25 was Serial 40-2242 and was Takeoff #8.
All of those 16 crews except Lieutenant Emmens's either crashed on the China coast or bailed out. His B-25 was consuming fuel at a much higher rate than planned on the mission, possibly due to incorrect engine carburetor settings. As a result, after attacking the target successfully in Japan, the plane turned north and touched down in a large field 40 miles north of Vladivostok in the Soviet Union. Doolittle had specifically told the Raiders not to fly to Russia. 
The Soviet Union, which was not then at war with Japan, held the crewmen captive for 13 months. Colonel Emmens later wrote a book about his experience as a captive, "Guests of the Kremlin." After landing in Vladivostok, Emmens wrote that the Soviets held its five crewmen in several locations in the Soviet Union. Limited to the same diet as the besieged Soviet people, mostly black bread and cabbage, the five crew members suffered malnutrition, dysentery and other medical problems. Rather than wait until the end of the war under deplorable conditions, the crew of resolved to escape. While held in Ashkhabad, near the Persian border - thousands of miles from Vladivostok - they found a sympathetic Soviet officer. The man introduced them to an Afghani smuggler who supplied the officers with better food and other black market items. Crewmen paid the smuggler $250 - won in a poker game the night before the mission by the pilot, Ski York - to lead them to a British embassy in Iran. The five, with the help of British diplomats in Mashhad, made their way to India and got a flight to the United States.
The B-25 aircraft was kept by the Soviets, and was scrapped in 1950s.
After his return to the United States, Emmens attended and graduated from the Army Command and Staff School, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Before retiring in 1965 he served in Europe and in Japan on Intelligence assignments. In June 1955 Colonel Emmens was assigned to supervise the construction efforts at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, assuming the role of Liaison Officer with both Ninth Air Force and HQ, Tactical Air Command. During his supervision, construction was performed at a rapid pace. He later served as the commander of the 342d Fighter Day Wing, the first host unit at Myrtle Beach AFB, and later as vice-commander of the 354th Fighter-Day Wing, which replaced the 342d FDW as the base's permanent host unit.
Colonel Emmens decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross, and Chinese Army, Navy, Air Corps Medal, Class A, 1st Grade, and the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure.
After his retirement, Robert Emmens returned to Medford, Oregon, his hometown, and worked as a stockbroker and in real estate. Colonel Emmens is interred at the I.O.O.F. Eastwood Cemetery in Medford and is a stop along the popular free public tour of the historic site which is managed by the City of Medford Parks and Recreation Department.
