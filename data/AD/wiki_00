Tabatha Takes Over

Tabatha Takes Over (formerly "Tabatha's Salon Takeover") is an American reality television series on the Bravo network, in which former "Shear Genius" contestant and hair salon owner, Tabatha Coffey helps failing salons turn around in one week. The series premiered on August 21, 2008 and is produced by Reveille Productions, a division of Shine Group.
In March 2011, Bravo announced that the fourth season of the series would be renamed "Tabatha Takes Over" and the premise would be expanded beyond just hair salons to include Coffey "taking over" various other small businesses and family enterprises. Season 4 premiered on Tuesday, January 10, 2012, with the final episode of the season airing on April 3, 2012. "Tabatha Takes Over" was renewed for Season 5 in December 2012. Season 5 premiered on April 4, 2013.
Format.
"Tabatha Takes Over" begins with Tabatha meeting the owner(s) of the business that she will take over; in Seasons 1 through 3, these were exclusively hair salons, but in Season 4, other struggling small business are featured (including a gay bar, a frozen yogurt parlor, and a dog grooming/doggie day care facility). During a discussion regarding the state of the business, Tabatha and the owner(s) watch surveillance tapes that invariably reveal poor management, unprofessional staff behavior, and uncomfortable/dissatisfied clientele; Tabatha demands the keys to the business and the takeover begins. Tabatha enters the business with the owner(s), informing the staff that she will take over and calls them out on what she has seen; she informs them that some staff could be in danger of losing their jobs. She then requests a tour ("The Inspection"), usually finding it dirty, unsanitary, and unorganized. She calls a staff meeting for the following day, during which she gets their point of view. After the staff meeting she brings in clients so she can assess the staff's work ("The Assessment"). By the end of the second day she sits down with the owner and talks about what she thinks should be changed. The third day usually consists of team building or marketing the business and the beginning of the renovation. The renovation takes about 3 days. By the last day, "The Reopening" happens, where the salon starts anew and Tabatha assesses their improvements in a week. By the end of the day she gives her "Final Recommendations" to the owner(s), announces to the staff the decisions of the owner(s) and gives the key back to the owner. After 6 weeks, Tabatha comes back to see how/if the business has changed.

Washington Square (composition)

"Washington Square" is the title of a popular instrumental from 1963 by the New York City-based jazz group The Village Stompers.
Named after the famous park in New York City, "Washington Square" became a hit single in November 1963, when it peaked at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, kept from the summit by Dale and Grace's hit song "I'm Leaving It Up to You" during the week that Kennedy was assassinated. It did, however, top the "Billboard" Easy Listening chart for three weeks that November and made the top 30 on the "Billboard" R&B chart. In addition, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Instrumental Theme.
Other artists have recorded the song, sometimes as a vocal track. Among these acts are The Ames Brothers (their last national chart record), the Kirby Stone Four, Percy Faith, Lawrence Welk, Kenny Ball, Spike Jones, James Last, Andre Kostelanetz, Kai Winding, The Ventures, Sammy Kaye & His Orchestra, and The Dukes of Dixieland.
"Washington Square" shares the same metre as many popular hymns, known as 86.86D or CMD Metre doubled. In the 1970s, some churches were singing hymns such as "The Lord Is My Shepherd" and "Amazing Grace" to the tune.

YMCA Aquatic Center

It features a first of its kind hydraulically retractable roof. The facility also incorporates a workout/ wellness center, martial arts center, and racquetball courts. 
Considered a very fast pool it has been the site of many national and international swimming competitions. Numerous world and American records have been set over the years at the facility by Pablo Morales, Janet Evans, Matt Biondi, Tom Jager, Dara Torres and others.
History of the YMCA Aquatic Center.
Formerly known as the Justus Aquatic Center it opened January 1985 as a business venture combining a hotel with a sporting venue. It was the first aquatic, fitness and hotel complex, of its kind. Financial problems plagued the center from the beginning. In the late 1980s there was a brief closure of the facility as it was taken in receivership by the Great Western Bank. The facility was renamed the Orlando International Aquatic and Fitness Center. Citing an operating loss of $600,000 a year and the impossibility of running an aquatics facility of that size in the black, the bank closed the center in January 1992. The center was to be destroyed in order to make a larger parking lot.
A local hotelier, Harris Rosen, fought the closure, by forming an organization called Friends of the Aquatic Center with several aquatics activists such as Dr. Lucky Meisenheimer, Scott Henderson, Julie Sundstrom and others. A six-month community battle ensued in the attempt to reopen the center. Rallies and protest marches were held and congressional representatives Jim Bacchus and Bill McCollum became involved.
Ultimately a deal between the county commission and the bank was arranged, in exchange for zoning changes that increased hotel room density at the site, the bank separated the Aquatic Center from the hotel and donated the facility to the county. Not wanting to manage the facility, the county offered the center to the Central Florida YMCA. Jerry Haralson the CEO of the Central Florida YMCAs agreed to add the Aquatic Center to the Central Florida YMCA community. 
In June 1992, the facility reopened as the YMCA Aquatic Center.
Charlie Stuart became the first chairman of the YMCA Aquatic Center’s Board of Directors and Richard Robinson was named the first executive Director. 
In 1994 Jim Ferber the CEO of the Central Florida YMCA arranged a partnership with Florida Hospital Orlando that resulted in the addition of a physical therapy and rehabilitation center to the YMCA Aquatic Center. The remodeling project was completed under the guidance of Jim Purdy the then executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center. 
In the mid 1990s, John Vasbinder took over as the executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center and for the first time the center began to run in the black. A $250,000 grant from Orange County resulted in further improvements to the center. 
Recently the YMCA Aquatic Center added a new $150,000 video scoreboard under the guidance of Steve Corrie the current executive Director of the YMCA Aquatic Center.
The YMCA Aquatic Center currently houses a number of competitive athletic teams in swimming, water polo, and diving. One of those programs is YCF Diving who, in 2012, had 2 Olympic Trials qualifiers (Justin Dumais & Wallace Layland) and 1 Olympian (Brittany Viola).. The YCF Water Polo program was named the 2012 Southeast Club of the year. Special Olympic/Dr P Phillips High School Coach and YMCA volunteer, Apryle Nickson was named the 2012 North America Special Olympic Coach of the Year.

Yoho River

The Yoho River is a silty, swift tributary of the Kicking Horse River in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The river is located entirely within Yoho National Park.
Course.
The Yoho River originates at the north end of Yoho National Park and flows generally south to join the Kicking Horse River some distance northeast of Field. It begins at the toe of the Yoho Glacier and flows within 5.8 km from its source it has already received the waters of Waves Creek, Twin Falls Creek, Fairy Creek & the Little Yoho River. It continues south for another 4.4 km to its confluence with the stream Takkakaw Falls is on. Along that stretch is a significant canyon in which the river drops over at least one major waterfall & possibly more. The river also picks up the waters of Whiskey-Jack Creek near Takkakaw Falls. From there it flows another 7.8 km to its confluence with the Kicking Horse River. At the confluence, the Yoho is actually the bigger of the two rivers. It is also the siltier of the two at the time, and most of the silt the Kicking Horse has comes from the Yoho.

Edward Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Escrick

Edward Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Escrick (died 24 April 1675) was a British nobleman and Parliamentarian.
Howard was the youngest son of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk. He was knighted KB. In 1624 he was elected Member of Parliament for Calne and for Wallingford and chose to sit for Calne. He was elected MP for Hertford in 1628 but created Baron Howard of Escrick on 12 April 1628. 
Howard was one of the twelve peers who signed the petition on grievances, which he presented to Charles I at York in 1640. He was very active in the early parts of the English Civil War. He was one of the ten Lords selected to attend the Westminster Assembly of Divines along with 20 Commoners as lay assessor, and was often employed in negotiations with Scottish officials. However, he was left off the Committee of Both Kingdoms and generally seems to play less of a role in the coming years.
After the abolition of the House of Lords in 1649 he sat in the Commons as member for Carlisle, being also a member of the council of state. In 1651 he was expelled from parliament for taking bribes.
Howard married Mary Butler, daughter of John Butler (or Boteler) and Elizabeth Villiers, and had two sons, Thomas, 2nd Baron Howard of Escrick, who married Elizabeth Mordaunt, daughter of John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough, and William Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Escrick, notorious both as a rebel and as an informer and double agent.

The Saxon Railway Museum ("Sächsisches Eisenbahnmuseum" or "SEM") is located in Chemnitz, in the state of Saxony, eastern Germany. It is situated on the site of the former locomotive depot ("Bahnbetriebswerk" or "Bw") for goods train locomotives in the district Hilbersdorf.
After the locomotive depot was closed in 1992, the society moved into the buildings which were protected as historical monuments. As a result the museum has two roundhouses with turntables. In addition there are coaling and sanding facilities, water cranes, a working jack for inspection pits and a range of other equipment found in an operational depot.
The exhibition area describes and portrays the evolution of the railway in Saxony and especially in the area of Chemnitz. In addition to an extensive range of steam, diesel and electric locomotives, the museum also has a large collection of operational, narrow-gauge, "Feldbahn" engines.
Many of the locomotives on show are loaned from private individuals, from the Dresden Transport Museum or the Nuremberg Transport Museum. As a result the museum's collection includes the following:
Special vehicles in the museum's fleet include a Tatra T141 tractor with a Culemeyer heavy trailer.
There is also a working DRG Class 50 steam locomotive, no. 50 3648, that is regularly used for special trips. At the end of August each year there is a large festival ("Heizhausfest") with a parade of locomotives.

Interactive contract manufacturing

Interactive contract manufacturing (ICM) is a neologism to describe the business model of companies that design, build, and deliver interactive assets for their business partners. In this model, advertising agencies team with an ICM in order to provide their clients with websites, interactive campaigns and promotions, and other business solutions using internet technologies. The ICM operates as a complete suite of interactive resources and knowledge for the agency, focused on mutually growing revenues. During this process, the ICM traditionally operates behind the scenes and does not have direct contact with the agency's client.
Contract manufacturing as a business model has proven tremendously successful, as demonstrated in other industries such as automotive, electronics, textiles, and many others. Electronic contract manufacturing was spawned by IBM in 1981, and grew into a trend that revolutionized the industry. Interactive contract manufacturing applies these same principles. 
Advertising agencies have struggled to transition to next generation business, failing to successfully capitalize off of increasing interactive work demands. As work for agencies has moved from offline to online, their choices for delivering interactive projects have been inefficient. Historically, agencies were relegated to hiring an in-house team of developers or outsourcing to a local webshop. These two options have been poor for agencies, because they have not positioned the agency to experience sustainable success.
The ICM serves to maximize business opportunities, economies of scale, and profitability for their partners.

<doc id="19094870" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19094870" title="Unknown Sender">
Unknown Sender

UNKNOWN SENDER is an internet television series created in the United States, which debuted in August 2008 on Strike.TV, a website created by Hollywood writers during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Like the other Strike.TV offerings which were sanctioned by the Writers' sister union, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), UNKNOWN SENDER was able to attract major talent to its cast, all of whom agreed to donate profits to the Hollywood charity, Actors' Fund. Among the actors in the series are Timothy Dalton, Joanne Whalley, Mindy Sterling (Austin Powers' "Frau Farbissina"), comedian Jay Davis (Dane Cook's "Tourgasm"), and Stan Freberg. 
Behind the camera, noteworthy figures include Academy Award nominee Marilyn Vance and pioneer web filmmaker Kevin Rubio ("Troops") among the producers; as well as "Lost" Director of Photography Edward J. Pei, film composer Adam Cohen ("The Incredibles)"; and Special Effects Supervisor Shant Jordan ("Hellboy II").
Series Premise.
The five to ten minute long UNKNOWN SENDER episodes consist of suspense or sci-fi stories which share the conceit that they are actual events, captured by closed circuit television (CCTV), surveillance monitors, amateur videographers, and the like, all collected and posted on the web by a mysterious, unseen "Unknown Sender".
Influences.
The creator of the show, "Die Hard" screenwriter Steven E. de Souza, described the series as "a cross between "The Twilight Zone" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". De Souza, a writer and director on HBO's similarly themed "Tales From the Crypt", said another influence was the legendary 1947-1949 Mutual (and later, ABC) network radio horror series, "Quiet, Please". Considered by many to be the best example of Golden Age Radio, and a direct precursor of "The Twilight Zone", "Quiet, Please" often dramatized its episodes as if the members of the listening audience were themselves participants or inadvertent observers, eavesdropping on the story’s action.
The first episode of UNKNOWN SENDER (1.1 "If You’re Seeing this tape…") acknowledges the "Quiet, Please" connection via its opening music, Symphony in D minor by César Franck, the same piece used as the theme for every episode of "Quiet, Please".
Critical Reaction.
Unknown Sender has been well received by the public and the press alike, having garnered positive reviews from such outlets as TV Guide, The McClatchy Company, and tilzy.tv. USA Today in particular hailed the series's "clever premise".

Tourism is a major industry in the area; a small year-round population is supplemented by an influx seasonal residents each Summer. It is the location of the SUNY-ESF Ranger School.
History.
The town was founded in 1902 by brothers Herbert and Horace Rich, founders of the Rich Brothers Lumber Company. Rich Lumber purchased on the southwestern shore of Cranberry Lake, and constructed a lumber mill. Housing for the millworkers was built in part from lumber salvaged from the company's abandoned Pennsylvania lumber operation. There were up to 1500 workers at the Rich Bros. mill and associated industries. The company built a school in 1903. A logging railroad was constructed connecting Wanakena to the Carthage and Adirondack Railroad at Benson Mines, starting operation in 1905.
A suspension footbridge built between the village and the mill for company workers before 1908 is still extant, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Wanakena Footbridge. It is one of the longest suspension foot bridges in the United States. The Wanakena Presbyterian Church is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The New York State Ranger School was established in 1912.

Alain Chapel

Alain Chapel (30 December 1937 – 10 July 1990) was a French Michelin 3 starred chef, credited with being one of the originators of Nouvelle Cuisine.
Chapel was born in Lyon, the son of Maître d' Charles and his wife Eva. At the outbreak of World War II, the family moved to the village of Mionnay 12 miles outside the city, where his father opened a bistro called "La Mere Charles" in an old coaching inn surrounded by lush gardens.
Alain started his training in the kitchen of the family bistro. A Chapel returned to the family bistro and in 1967 gained the now restaurant its first Michelin star. After taking over the restaurant in 1970 on the death of his father, he converted the inn to a hotel and renamed it in his own name. In 1973, Chapel gained his third Michelin star, then one of only 19 restaurants all in France which had ever then gained the honour.
Chapel's signature dishes included stuffed calves' ears with fried parsley, truffle-stuffed chicken tightly enveloped in a pork bladder and cooked in a rich chicken broth. Food critic Craig Claiborne writing for "The New York Times" in 1977 described Chapel's gateau de foies blonds as "his ultimate triumph" and "one of the absolute cooking glories of this generation". According to the "Gault Millau Guide to France": "A meal at Chapel's restaurant was like a symphony."
Throughout the rest of his life, the establishment retained all three of its Michelin stars. The speed of transformation and the cuisine developed turned the village of Mionnay into a culinary landmark on any serious gastronomic tour of France. The attraction was also as great for young chefs, who sought the opportunity to work with Chapel – these included Michel Roux Jr.
In the process of opening a restaurant in Florida, United States, in 1990 while visiting friends and attending the annual summer festival in Avignon, Chapel died of a stroke. Chapel left a wife Suzanne, and two sons David and Romain.
Eventually the restaurant lost its third Michelin star. All efforts to keep up the etablissement to former standards ultimately failed.

Elimination rate constant

The elimination rate constant "K" is a value used in pharmacokinetics to describe the rate at which a drug is removed from the system.
It is often abbreviated "K" or "K""e". It is equivalent to the fraction of a substance that is removed per unit time measured at any particular instant and has units of T−1. This can be expressed mathematically with the differential equation
where formula_2 is the blood plasma concentration of drug in the system at a given point in time formula_3, formula_4 is an infinitely small change in time, and formula_5 is the concentration of drug in the system after the infinitely small change in time.
The solution of this differential equation is useful in calculating the concentration after the administration of a single dose of drug:

Alaska Federation of Natives

The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) is the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska. Its membership includes 178 villages (both federally recognized tribes and village corporations), thirteen regional native corporations, and twelve regional nonprofit and tribal consortiums that contract and run federal and state programs. AFN is governed by a 37-member board, which is elected by its membership at the annual convention held each October. The mission of AFN is to enhance and promote the cultural, economic and political voice of the entire Alaska native community.
History.
The Alaska Federation of Natives was formed in October 1966, when more than 400 Alaska Natives representing 17 Native organizations gathered for a three-day conference to address Alaska Native aboriginal land rights. From 1966 to 1971, AFN worked primarily to achieve passage of a just and fair land settlement. On December 18, 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law.
In the early and mid-1970s, AFN provided technical assistance to help Alaska Natives implement ANCSA and set up the corporations mandated by the Act. Since then, AFN has evolved to meet the changing needs of Alaska Natives and respond to new challenges as they emerge, working to address and protect Native interests at the state and federal levels.
AFN was instrumental in the development and passage of federal laws including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, and the 1987 Amendments to ANCSA (the “1991 legislation”). At the state level, AFN plays an active role in the legislative process, promoting laws, policies and programs in areas such as health, education, resource development, labor and government. In the late 1980s, AFN turned its attention to social, tribal and economic issues.
AFN's Detailed Mission.
Alaska Native people began as members of full sovereign nations and continue to enjoy a unique political relationship with the federal government. We will survive and prosper as distinct ethnic and cultural groups and will participate fully as members of the overall society. The mission of AFN is to enhance and promote the cultural, economic and political voice of the entire Alaska Native community. AFN’s major goals are to:
AFN Convention.
The AFN Convention is the largest representative annual gathering in the United States of any Native peoples. Delegates are elected on a population formula of one representative per twenty-five Native residents in the area and delegate participation rates at the annual convention typically exceed 95%. 3,000-4,000 people attend each year, including 1,000 voting delegates from across the state and the proceedings are broadcast live via television, radio and webcast reaching Alaska Natives and non-Natives alike from Barrow to Ketchikan, from the Aleutian Chain to the Canadian border. During the convention, the entire state of Alaska is blanketed with discussion on current events and issues. International observers are present at most meetings, both exchanging information and learning from the Alaska Native experience. Each year the convention adopts a theme.
Quyana Alaska.
Their traditional dances remain the lifeblood of their culture and their communities: they sustain them and connect them with their rich cultural history. Passed from generation to generation, their dances ensure that the many distinct Native cultures across Alaska remain connected to their origins.
For over 20 years, Alaska Natives have come together in dance to celebrate Quyana Alaska during AFN’s Annual Convention. First introduced at the 1982 Convention, Quyana Alaska was designed to restore the traditional dances and ensure that they were passed on to the future generations. To date, over 200 different dance groups have performed at Native gatherings across the state. The cultural revival has certainly exploded across rural Alaska, and Quyana Alaska is now a treasured highlight of each and every Convention.
Denali Awards.
The AFN's highest honor for people of non-native ancestry is named after the state's (and continent's) highest mountain. Recipients have included Tony Knowles and Ann Fienup-Riordan.

Andropogon virginicus

Andropogon virginicus is a species of grass known by several common names, including broomsedge bluestem, yellowsedge bluestem and (in Australia, because it was introduced to that country after being used as packaging for bottles of American whiskey) whiskey grass. It is native to the southeastern United States and as far north as the Great Lakes. It is known as an introduced species in California and Hawaii, where it is weedy.
Invasive Species.
"A. virginicus" has also been introduced to Japan and Australia. It competes with other species by allelopathy, releasing persistent herbicidal chemicals from its dying tissues, such as decaying leaves. "A. virginicus" colonizes disturbed areas such as abandoned mining sites. It is a weed of pastures and grazing ranges, where it proves less palatable and nutritious to cattle than other grasses. This species is tolerant of fire and grows back quickly and more abundantly after a burn. It is perhaps most problematic in Hawaii, where its natural growth patterns are out of synch with the local climate. It is dormant during the Hawaiian rainy season, dying back and leaving the slopes it has colonized exposed and vulnerable to significant erosion. Despite its weediness, the grass is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant.
Life History.
"A. virginicus" is a perennial grass forming narrow clumps of stems up to just over a meter in maximum height. Its stems and leaves are green when new, turning purplish to orange and then straw-colored with age. It produces large amounts of seeds small enough to disperse on the wind. This grass is successful in a wide range of habitats. It is a prolific seed producer, it has a high germination rate and seedling survival rate, and it thrives in poor soils.

Kenny Roberts (musician)

Kenny Roberts (October 14, 1926 – April 29, 2012) was an American country music singer. He was born George S. Kingsbury Jr. in Lenoir City, Tennessee, but raised on a farm outside of Greenfield, Massachusetts. He is best known for his recordings of "I Never See Maggie Alone" and "Choc'late Ice Cream Cone", and was a member of The Down Homers with Bill Haley.
Life and career.
He started in music at the age of 11, when he organized a band consisting entirely of young harmonica players. Later, he learned to play guitar and then bass fiddle and violin. He was inspired by Yodeling Slim Clark, Jimmie Rodgers and other singing cowboys and was known as a blue yodeler. Roberts learned to yodel and at the age of 17, won a New Hampshire radio contest to be chosen as "Eastern States Yodeling Champion" in 1944. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in early 1945, and moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, after World War II ended. He performed on several shows on radio station KMOX in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as the CBS Saturday morning show "Barnyard Frolics." then organized and led a Pennsylvania-based western swing band called the Down Homers, recording for Vogue Records.
Rock and roll pioneer Bill Haley joined the band in 1946 as a guitarist and yodeler replacing Roberts who had joined the Navy. Before departing, Roberts taught Haley some of his yodels. When Roberts returned from service, he resumed his spot with the Down Homers relieving Haley. In the early 2000s, a set of 1946 radio recordings by the Down Homers were discovered and Haley is named and performs the solo number "She Taught Me to Yodel."
Roberts signed a recording contract with Coral Records in 1949, a division of Decca. His first release "I Never See Maggie Alone" was an immediate hit. He followed with other hits including "River of Tears," "I've Got the Blues," "Yodel Polka," "She Taught Me to Yodel," and "Hillbilly Style."
He soon began to jump while yodeling and became popular with youngsters thanks to the jumping, yodeling and his cowboy tunes. He starred in a children's TV show in 1953, performing in Cincinnati on WLW-TV. He performed on Arthur Godfrey's CBS network talent program.
Roberts played at the Hoosier Hop in Fort Wayne, as well as the WCOP Hayloft Jamboree. He later performed on the Midwestern Hayride during the 1950s from Cincinnati. He became a regional star through television shows in Dayton, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana. He began a daily cartoon show on WNEM TV-5 in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1961, as "The Kenny Roberts Show" where he was known as "The Yodeling Cowboy." The popular black-and-white show featured Roberts singing and playing guitar as he hosted children in the studio, and presented cartoons. His best-known locally-performed song was "Cheer Up, Things Could Be Worse." The program stayed on the air for about five years. Roberts moved back to Dayton in the early 1970s, and later, moved back to Massachusetts. He played concerts in the region, and released on album for Palomino around 1980, followed by Longhorn's "Then and Now," which combined historical cuts with new recordings.
Though essentially retired, he continued to give concerts around the Northeast throughout the decade.
Roberts died in April 2012 in Athol, Massachusetts, aged 85.

<doc id="19095089" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19095089" title="Sangarius Bridge">
Sangarius Bridge

The Sangarius Bridge or Bridge of Justinian (Turkish: "Justinianos Köprüsü" or "Beşköprü") is a late Roman bridge over the river Sakarya () in Anatolia, in modern-day Turkey. It was built by the East Roman Emperor Justinian I (527-565 AD) to improve communications between the capital Constantinople and the eastern provinces of his empire. With a remarkable length of 430 m, the bridge was mentioned by several contemporary writers, and has been associated with a supposed project, first proposed by Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan, to construct a navigable canal that would bypass the Bosporus.
Location and history.
The Sangarius Bridge is located in northwestern Anatolia, in the ancient region of Bithynia, ca. 5 km from the town of Adapazarı. Today, the bridge spans the small Çark Deresi stream (called Melas in Antiquity), which flows from the nearby Sapanca Lake; the modern course of the far wider Sakarya lies 3 km to the East.
In Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the bridge served an important purpose: it was the crossing-point of the strategically important military road from the Bosporus to the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, which were threatened by the Sassanid Empire. Before the stone bridge was constructed, a wooden pontoon bridge existed, which, according to Procopius, was frequently washed away when the river flooded, costing many men their lives.
The date of construction for the stone bridge can be accurately determined from contemporary sources: two laudatory poems of Paul the Silentiary and Agathias, dating to the year 562, celebrate its completion, and the chronicler Theophanes records that the work began in "Anno Mundi" 6052, which corresponds to 559–560. Conversely, since Procopius states that the bridge was still under construction when he wrote his work on Justinian's building projects ("De Aedificiis"), this would mean that it was written in the years 560–561, five to six years later than earlier presumed. However, given that Theophanes' dating is somewhat inaccurate, it may well be that the bridge's construction had originally started in ca. 554.
Construction.
The bridge is built of blocks of limestone, and, including the abutments at each end, totals 429 m in length, with a width of 9.85 m and a height of up to 10 m. The bridge rests on seven main arches. The central five arches span ranges from 23 to 24.5 m, with the piers between them ca. 6 m thick. They are complemented on either side by a smaller arch with a span of ca. 20 m. The Çark Deresi stream flows through one of the western arches today. In addition, there are further five arches (two in the western and three in the eastern ends) of between 3 and 9 m on the banks of the river bed, which served as spillways in case the river overflowed. The eastern part of the bridge has been partially destroyed by the construction of a railway line along the river's course. The seven main piers were apparently decorated with small Christian crosses, which, with the exception of two, seem to have been destroyed.
In detail, the width of the main architectural elements (spans in bold, piers in parentheses) are, in meters:
The piers are shaped so as to act as cutwaters, rounded on the upstream and pointed on the downstream side. The only exception is the broadest pier on the western shore, which is wedge-shaped on both sides. This feature of the Sangarius bridge sets it apart from most known Roman bridges, which usually feature pointed cut-waters upstream, and - if existing - also downstream. 
On the western entrance a triumphal arch stood, while on the eastern side there are the remains of an apse, whose function is unclear, but possibly served as a religious shrine. The apse features an East-oriented half-dome, and is 11 m high and 9 m wide. The remains of the arch, now vanished, are illustrated in the sketches made in 1838 by Léon de Laborde: they depict an arched doorway, made of stone masonry, lying immediately at the entrance of the bridge. The next sketch provides some measured dimensions: the doorway was 10.37 m high and 6.19 m wide, while the pillars to either side were 4.35 m thick.
The bridge was also adorned by an inscription bearing an epigram by Agathias. The inscription has not survived, but its content has been preserved in the writings of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus:

Sacrifice Medal

The Sacrifice Medal () is a decoration that was created in 2008 as a replacement for the Wound Stripe. It is awarded by the Canadian monarch, usually via his or her federal viceroy, to members of the Canadian Forces or allied forces wounded or killed in action, and to members whose death under honourable circumstances is a result of injury or disease related directly to military service.
Design.
The Sacrifice Medal is in the form of a diameter silver disc topped by a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing the Canadian monarch's role as the fount of honour. On the obverse is an effigy of the reigning sovereign and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces wearing a diadem of maple leaves and snowflakes, surrounded by the inscription "ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA CANADA" (Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada). On the reverse is the word "SACRIFICE" alongside a depiction of the statue "Mother Canada", one of Walter Seymour Allward's allegorical figures adorning the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France. The recipient's name, along with his or her rank and service number for those in the military, is inscribed around the medal's edge.
This medallion is worn at the left chest, suspended on a 31.8mm wide ribbon coloured with vertical stripes in purposefully sombre red (recalling spilled blood), black (symbolizing grief and loss), and white (representative of both hope and peace). Should an individual already possessing a Sacrifice Medal be awarded the medal again for subsequent injuries, he or she is granted a medal bar—in silver with raised edges and bearing a maple leaf—for wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended.
Eligibility.
On 29 August 2008, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, created the Sacrifice Medal to recognize any member of the Canadian Forces, soldier of an allied force, or a civilian working for the Canadian Forces, who after 7 October 2001 was killed or wounded under honourable circumstances and as a result of hostile action or perceived hostile action. If not fatal, the wound received must be serious enough to require attention from a medic, and the treatment must have been recorded in the individual's medical file. These tenets were later augmented when, on 19 October 2009, the Department of National Defence announced that all service related deaths would qualify for the Sacrifice Medal, whether as a result of direct hostile action or not.

These applications include: launch systems, avionics, telemetry, navigation, drive control, mission computers, cameras and other instruments.
Irish operations.
In August 2012 Microsemi marked its 20 years of operations in Ireland by naming Ennis its European headquarters. According to company officials, the announcement represented an endorsement of the work of the Ennis facility and its contribution to the wider Microsemi global network. In conjunction with naming Ennis its European headquarters, the company announced the inaugural Microsemi Scholarship in Engineering at the University of Limerick. In addition, the company funded a high-profile science and aerospace engineering programme in St. Flannan’s school in Ennis. 
Microsemi works closely with the Industrial Development Authority (IDA Ireland), which is responsible for attracting and developing overseas investment in Ireland. Support from IDA Ireland was a key factor in the company’s decision to invest in the region.
Microsemi established its presence in Ireland in 1992 through the acquisition of a facility in Ennis Co. Clare. Microsemi made significant investments in its Ennis operations and is now one of the largest employers in the area. The Ennis facilities key competencies are the development, manufacturing and high reliability testing of semiconductors to meet stringent aerospace, satellite, medical and security standards and it is now one of the largest such facilities globally. Microsemi also has a design group in Dublin which is focused on advanced system-on-chip (SoC) software and solutions with an emphasis on ARM processor-centric designs.
Controversies.
James Peterson education claims.
In 2009 Barry Minkow, co-founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, published a report claiming that James Peterson, Microsemi's President and CEO, had not obtained a Bachelor's degree or Masters of Business Administration as he had listed on his biography on STEC Inc.’s regulatory filings (as part of his board position with that company) and on a US government security clearance application. Peterson responded with a public statement saying he "categorically" denied the reports. The next day, the registrar of Brigham Young advised that they had double-checked and had no records of Peterson ever having obtained any degrees. An independent inquiry was made on behalf of the board by the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, which confirmed that in fact Peterson had not earned either degree. As a penalty for misrepresenting his academic credentials, Peterson paid Microsemi a fine and forwent his 2008 bonus.
ASIC backdoor claims.
It has been reported that Actel's ProASIC3 A3P250 FPGAs, which are made by Microsemi and marketed for and widely used in aerospace and defense systems, have an embedded backdoor that cannot be disabled. Microsemi has denied this.

Zerene cesonia

The Southern Dogface, Colias cesonia, is a North American butterfly in the family Pieridae, subfamily Coliadinae (until recently the species was sometimes placed in the related genus "Colias" instead of "Zerenia").
Description.
The upper side of the pointed fore wings have a dogface pattern. The wings are mainly yellow with black borders. The under side of the wings is mostly yellow with a black eyespot on the fore wing and two white spots on the hind wing.
Ecology.
This butterfly can be found in short-grass prairie hills, open woodlands, and near road edges.
Both male and female Southern Dogfaces may be seen feeding at flowers such as Alfalfa, "Coreopsis sp.", "Houstonia sp.", and "Verbena sp.". Males are also fond of puddling. Its host plants include Lead Plant "Amorpha canescens", False Indigo "Amorpha fruticosa", Soy Bean "Glycine max", Alfalfa "Medicago sativa", Black Dalea "Dalea frutescens", Purple Prairie Clover "Dalea purpurea", and clover "Trifolium sp.".
Males patrol areas for females. The male is the active flight partner. The green-white eggs are laid on the underside of the host plant leaves. The larva is green with a white stripe running down each side of its body. The green chrysalis hangs up right with a silken girdle around itself.

TAPR Open Hardware License

The TAPR Open Hardware License is a license used in open-source hardware projects. It was created by Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (TAPR), an international amateur radio organization. Version 1.0 was published on May 25, 2007.
According to the official website, like the GNU General Public License, the OHL is designed to guarantee freedom to share and to create. It forbids anyone who receives rights under the OHL to deny any other licensee those same rights to copy, modify, and distribute documentation, and to make, use and distribute products based on that documentation.
Conditions.
Although the TAPR OHL aims to maintain the philosophy of open-source software, there are obvious differences in physical reality which require some differences in licenses. As a result, the license defines two conditions, Documentation, as in design information and Products, as in the physical products created from them.
Terms.
According to the text of the license,
Adoption.
The TAPR OHL is the license for the materials from the Open Graphics Project as of April 7, 2009.
The TAPR OHL is the license for the materials from Lotus Green Data Centers as of July 28, 2008.
Noncommercial.
There is also a TAPR Noncommercial Hardware License, which is similar but does not allow for commercial application. As of September, 2012, TAPR has officially deprecated the NCL and removed the document from its web site.
Criticism.
Former OSI president Eric S. Raymond expressed some concerns about certain aspects of the OHL. According to Raymond, the license has "lots of problems" and that it "strips the word 'distribution' of its normal meaning, assuring lots of contention over edge cases." There are also concerns that the Open Hardware License may merely place the design and/or idea into the Public Domain by effectively publishing it before securing the benefits of patent protection. Like all Open Hardware Licenses, the OSI has not chosen to review the TAPR license.

La Rinascente

La Rinascente (derived from Rinascita - means "rebirth" in Italian) is a Thai owned Italian retailer operating upscale department stores in the area of clothing, household and beauty products, founded in Milan in 1865 by Luigi and Ferdinando Bocconi. <br>
On May 27, 2011 Central Retail bought a 100% stake of the 150-year-old store firm for 260 million euros. "Our ultimate goal is to take it global and to be recognised all across Asia, be it in Thailand, China, Japan or Hong Kong," Chief Executive Officer Tos Chirathivat told reporters. Central Retail also planned new Rinascente stores in Italy and expected the takeover to break even within eight years. 
La Rinascente was the first department store to open in Rome in 1887.
Currently La Rinascente owns a chain of 11 department stores located in Italian major cities: two in Rome and one in Milan, Genoa, Turin, Florence, Palermo, Catania, Cagliari, Padova and Monza.
The flagship concept store is La Rinascente Milano Piazza Duomo, in Milan.
History.
The Bocconi brothers opened a first clothing shop named "Aux Villes d'Italie" in Via Santa Radegonda (next to Piazza del Duomo, Milan) in 1877, inspired by "Le Bon Marché" - probably the first modern clothing store - which had been successful in Paris for some decades already. The business grew very quickly and within few years they opened stores in several more Italian cities. People were attracted by the then-new concept of exposing the clothes in plain sight and allowing customers to walk around the shop and "watch and desire". The Bocconi brothers, however, failed to support this advantage with a targeted commercial strategy, so the success was relatively short-lived. The onset of World War I worsened the decline and by 1917 the chain of stores was about to go out of business.
Instead the Bocconi brothers sold to entrepreneur Senatore Borletti, who went looking for ideas to relaunch the business. He hired decadent poet Gabriele d'Annunzio, arguably the most influential figure in the Italian culture at the time, to suggest a new public image for the store. The poet suggested "La Rinascente" (i.e. "she who is born again") as the new name, to symbolize the rebirth of the store but also, and more significantly, the rebirth of Italy at the end of a war which was causing widespread poverty.
On Christmas night, 1918 - the first Christmas in peacetime - a short circuit caused the renovated main store in Piazza del Duomo to burn to the ground. When it opened again after being rebuilt, the name had a new meaning besides the original: that of a place which had been literally "born again" from its ashes.
The Borletti family kept ownership of the chain until the late Sixties. The stores have since kept the name suggested by d'Annunzio and are still very popular today among Italian citizens and tourists.

USS Investigator (AGR-9)

USS "Investigator" (AGR-9/YAGR-9) was a "Guardian"-class radar picket ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1956 from the “mothballed” reserve fleet. She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Atlantic Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line.
Liberty ship built in Florida.
"Investigator" (YAGR-9) was launched by J. A. Jones Co., Inc., Panama City, Florida, as Liberty Ship "Charles A. Draper" 9 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. E. L. Cills; and delivered 24 January 1945 to Polarus Steamship Co., Inc.
World War II service.
The ship carried replacement aircraft and cargo until the end of the war and entered the James River National Defense Reserve Fleet 26 October 1945.
1957-1965 radar picket duty.
After a brief period of service in 1947, she entered the Reserve Fleet at Mobile, Alabama, and was acquired by the Navy 2 July 1956. Renamed "Investigator", she was converted to Navy use at Charleston Naval Shipyard and commissioned there 16 January 1957, Lt. Comdr. J. H. Mehus in command.
Equipped with the latest in air search and tracking systems, the ship conducted her shakedown training in the Caribbean and departed Guantanamo Bay for her new home port, Davisville, Rhode Island. "Investigator" began her operational pattern of three- to four-week cruises in the North Atlantic Ocean as the seaward extension of the Continental Air Defense Command's air early warning system. Operating with search aircraft, she could detect, track, and report aircraft at long ranges, and could control high speed U.S. interceptor aircraft and direct them to targets. 
The ship was reclassified "AGR-9" effective 28 September 1958. She continued radar picket station duties for the Continental Air Defense Command, detecting and tracking inbound airborne objects and controlling jet interceptor aircraft until decommissioned 29 March 1965.
Decommissioning.
Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 April 1965. She was transferred the same day to the U.S. Maritime Commission and entered the Maritime Hudson River Defense Reserve Fleet, New York, where she remained until sold for scrap in Spain, 15 May 1971.

Regenerative cooling is a method of cooling gases in which compressed gas is cooled by allowing it to expand and thereby taking heat from the surroundings, the cooled expanded gas then passes through a heat exchanger where it cools the incoming compressed gas.
History.
In 1857, Siemens introduced the regenerative cooling concept with the Siemens cycle. In 1895, William Hampson in England and Carl von Linde in Germany independently developed and patented the Hampson-Linde cycle to liquefy air using the Joule Thomson expansion process and regenerative cooling. On 10 May 1898, James Dewar used regenerative cooling to become the first to statically liquefy hydrogen.

Dascyllus albisella

"Dascyllus albisella" also known as the White-Spotted Damsel is a marine fish found in the Eastern Central Pacific.
Description.
Length up to 12.5 cm, dark gray to black, but centers of scales on body are whitish.
Habitat.
Associated with coral reefs, most usually in shallow, protected waters.
swim in shallow water surface to 20 feet below in small openings.
Distribution.
The species is found around the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Island.
Behavior.
‘ ’Dascyllus albisella’ ’, also known as pomacentridae are a relatively passive species. Normally, males are the more aggressive of the two genders as they are the ones that usually exhibit parental care. While male aggressiveness is expected, males exhibit sole care of the offspring unlike most animals. This is due to the uniparental nature of ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘. This does not indicate that the females are not present whatsoever. Nor does this show that the females only have a duty to lay the eggs. In cases where the male is not present, females may develop more aggressiveness depending on the situation. As we can see, females do not desert the nest after mating. Females that are larger are more likely to defend the nest in the absence of the male than smaller females. That being said, the nest is defended most frequently by females that were born at that nest. This does not apply to all the females. Some females, even when raised at the nest will not defend the nest regardless. This increased aggressiveness is more favored towards the larger females, however the correlation isn’t terribly strong between size and nest defense. There is only a tendency for larger fish to defend. In another case when both parents are present, the female will display increased aggressiveness when predation levels increase. Females have a tendency to only display aggressiveness when said female’s eggs are in danger. ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘ displays aggression by making chirping sounds. There is a difference in the chirping that ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘ utilizes towards their own versus other organisms. Females tend to produce aggressive sounds when a male is chased by other female fish. Towards their own species, they make a popping sound that is composed of multiple pulses. In addition, they make these aggressive sounds when chasing juveniles. Towards other species, ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘ will make a one and two pulse. The fact that they make different aggressive sounds towards other species shows that they are capable of distinguishing themselves from one another ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘ are also known to hold territories. A territory holder will interact aggressively only when other fish attempt to enter its domain. A territory holder will tolerate most of the fish entering its territory. However, a few fish will be chased away immediately. This behavior is possibly due to those chased away were of similar size to the territory holder and threatened its control on its own territory ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘ interact with each other at an early age as well. The younger fish are referred to as juveniles. In these juvenile interactions we see that ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘ form a size based linear dominance. As one can expect, the aggressive scuffles are between larger fish and smaller fish. This behavior most likely establishes the hierarchy early on. This is further reinforced by the observation that growth is less in lower status fish or in larger groups. For larger groups this is most likely that the fish in the group are keeping each other smaller due the hierarchy, as a result, they retard their growth. We see that these fish will settle in a group during settling season and said fish will stay in their group even if they chance upon a better group, which shows that ‘ ‘Dascyllus albisella’ ‘ aren’t that aggressive in their choice of group.

When I Was Young

"When I Was Young" is a song with a countercultural theme released in early 1967 by Eric Burdon, with The Animals and was written by five of the band members Eric Burdon (vocals), Barry Jenkins (drums), John Weider (guitar/violin), Vic Briggs (guitar)
and Danny McCulloch (bass). It charted in Australia peaking #2 and stayed 4 weeks there. Later it was a hit charting #10 on the Canadian RPM chart, # 15 in the United States and #7 in the Netherlands. The song has been covered by many punk rock and heavy metal bands.
This song is noted for its Indian riff, played by an electric guitar as well as a violin. It is also distinctive for its introduction featuring a heavily distorted guitar's tremolo descent from E to D. 
This somewhat autobiographical song told about Burdon's father, who was a soldier during tough times, as well as young Eric's adventures including his first smoke of a cigarette at 10, to his meeting his first love at 13. The final verse shows his disillusionment with society by saying:
"My faith was so much stronger then,/
I believed in fellow men,/
And I was so much older then./
When I was Young".
This song begins in E Minor, and ends in G Minor. The B-Side "A Girl Named Sandoz" is named after the drug company that invented LSD.
Later it was used for a German TV commercial. In the early 80s Burdon began to mention many stars who died at the end of the song.

They lived in Björknäs at Hållsviken west of Trosa in Södermanland. He subsequently married Ria Wägner and then spent forty years living in Lidingö, Stockholm.
Sandgren's parents were O.J. Sandgren and Karolina Adolfsson, who gave their son a poor but happy childhood. The father was—in addition to his work— a fiddler. Their son Gustav had since childhood, both heard and played on the fiddle—a musical instrument which he handled with skill throughout life. He was fascinated by folklore, mystery and dreams.
After school Sandgren became a laborer and worked for five years at Cloetta chocolate in Ljungsbro. He eventually became a full-time writer, and was to have 47 books behind him when he died in 1983. He also wrote poetry collections (a few written with his wife Ria Wägner).

Chandrashekhar Shankar Dharmadhikari

Chandrashekhar Shankar Dharmadhikari (Dr.C.S.Dharmadhikari) (20 November 1927, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India is an Indian independence movement activist, a lawyer, a judge and an author. He was acting chief justice of Bombay High Court. He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 2003. He has authored many books in the Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati languages.
Early life.
Dr. Dharmadhikari was a Khadi-dhari from his birth (wearing only Khadi clothes from his birth). He was born in a Brahmin house to Late Smt. Damayanti Dharmadhikari and Acharya Dada Dharmadhikari. In his childhood biography Shashvat Shikshan Sampatti taken from "Athvanitil Shala Ani Shikshak" from Jivan Shikshan , he mentions how he and other freedom fighter's children grew up like a "Cactus" meaning that they grew up and learned independently as their parents would be away in freedom campaigns most of their time. His father was imprisoned in 1930, 1932 and 1942 and his mother took part in individual Satyagraha in 1941 and Quit India Movement of 1942 and was imprisoned for about three years due to which the upper class would say to him (also to other children like him) that "Neither fear of father nor mother, son went on to become a volunteer."
As a child he went to primary municipal school near Chitnis Park in Nagpur for one year. In 1935 he moved to Wardha and used to stay at Bajajwadi which was a center for many freedom fighters. There he took entry in second standard at Tilak Municipal Primary School. At that time he with his friend found a club which was named Ghanchakkar Samaj by his father Dada Dharmdhikari. After completing his primary education he took admission at Nav Bharat Vidyalaya, Wardha which was set up under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi. C.S. Dharmadhikari is also educated from S.B. City College, Noshar Mahavidyala and University College of Law Nagpur.
Family.
His grandfather is Shri. T. D. Dharmadhikari. His parents are late Smt. Damayanti Dharmadhikari and Acharya Dada Dharmadhikari.He has three brothers and one sister. Their names are Pradyumna Dharmadhikari, Yashwant Dharmadhikari, Bacchu Dharmadhikari and Usha Dharmadhikari (Tamaskar). Of all his brothers and sister, Chandrashekar Dharmadhikari is the only one alive and is staying at Mumbai. He married late Mrs. Tara Dharmadhikari. They had a daughter Aruna Patil and two sons − Satyaranjan and Ashutosh.
His grandfather Shri. T. D. Dharmadhikari was in judicial service whereas C.S. Dharmadhikari's father was a well-known Gandhian thinker and freedom fighter and one of the strongest adherents of Mahatma Gandhi's principles. His mother late Smt. Damayanti Dharmadhikari took part in individual Satyagraha in 1941 and Quit India Movement of 1942 and was imprisoned for about three years. His brother Late Y. S. Dharmadhikari was Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh and her wife late Mrs. Tara Dharmadhikari is M. A. (Economics) and held Diploma in Journalism and was Deputy Director, Information and Publicity, Government of Maharashtra and Editor, Lokrajya. C.S. Dharmadhikari's daughter Aruna Patil is a doctor and his son, Satyaranjan is judge of High Court of Bombay and Ashutosh is an Advocate.
Indian independence movement activist.
He took part in Quit India Movement of 1942 at the age of 14 when he was still taking education. At the age of 14, he left school and thereafter an order was issued by the British Government that he should not be admitted into any Recognized School. He took active part in Quit India Movement. His two elder brothers, father, mother and other family members were already in jail, and he was the only male member left in the family. Therefore, he avoided arrest and since then worked underground and was responsible for various activities, which sustained and maintained Quit India Movement for years together.
His contribution to the National Movement now gets recognition from the Government of Maharashtra, when Government included his name in a prestigious list of Freedom Fighters, without any request or application, and is also granted Freedom Fighter's Pension.
Judge.
Chandrashekhar Dharmadhikari belongs to the family of lawyers. His grandfather Shri. T. D. Dharmadhikari was in judicial Service and was known for his integrity and uprightness. His Brother Late Y.

Judgments delivered by him, relating to Rights of Women, tribal people, children, insane people, prisoners are landmarks. In his Judgment during the Emergency, he held that apart from the Constitutional Right, Right to Life is natural and human right and therefore, even during the Emergency, a citizen has a right to approach the High Court, as natural and human right to life cannot be taken away which was a unique judgment. As per this Judgment he entertained the petitions and released the detained people, against whom there was no material. He was well known as an independent, most upright and fearless judge.

The Linked Ring

The Linked Ring (also known as "The Brotherhood of the Linked Ring") was a photographic society created to propose and defend that photography was just as much an art as it was a science, motivated to propelling photography further into the fine art world. Members dedicated to the craft looked for new techniques that would cause less knowledgeable to steer away, persuading photographers and enthusiasts to experiment with chemical processes, printing techniques and new styles.
Motivation to create the Linked Ring.
Photography was interpreted in two ways; art photography and science photography. The science of photography requires practice that determines the outcome of the image, whereas the art aspect of photography concerns itself with the aesthetic experience and success of the photograph to the viewer. These differences created a tension in the craft that the Linked Ring sought to change. 
The group was founded in May, 1892, by Henry Peach Robinson, former Photographic Society member George Davison, and Henry Van der Weyde. The Brotherhood was "a means of bringing together those who are interested in the development of the highest form of Art of which Photography is capable." Membership of the group was by invitation only; other members included William Smedley-Aston, Frank Sutcliffe, Frederick H. Evans, Paul Martin, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Frederick Hollyer, J. B. B. Wellington, Richard Keene, James Craig Annan, Alfred Horsley Hinton, Lydell Sawyer, Alfred Maskell and, later, Americans Alfred Stieglitz, Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr., and Clarence H. White. Although works by female photographers such as those by Zaida Ben-Yusuf were exhibited at the annual shows during the 1890s, it was not until 1900 that Gertrude Käsebier became one of the first elected female members of the Ring.
Linked Ring Successes.
In November 1893, Robinson created the Photographic Salon, an annual exhibit event in England whose aim was to "exhibit (images) that are description of pictorial photography in which there is distinct evidence of personal feeling and execution." As a result, interest grew in processes such as gum bi-chromate, oil pigment and transfer, and supported the trend in producing images not for reproduction, but works of high value, as well as creating interest in surface texture, papers, and color of print.
In 1896 they began publishing The Linked Ring Papers, which were circulated annually to members until 1909 to promote and discuss the aesthetics and practice of Pictorialism.
Photo-Secession - the American counterpart of the Linked Ring.
The Photo-Secession was founded by photographer Alfred Stieglitz in 1902. Stieglitz wanted to show that photography had artistic expression similar to that of painting and sculpture, emphasizing further the craftsmanship abilities of photographers. Photo-Secession members were also called American Links, and displayed works in the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at Fifth Avenue, New York City. Members include Mary Devens, Frank Eugene, Gertrude Kasabier, William B. Dyer, Eva Watson Shutze, Eduard Steichen, Edmund Stirling, and Clarence White.
Prominent Members & Contributions.
Pictorialist James Craig Annan, born into a household at the forefront of photography technology. In 1866 his father created a four foot print of an eleven foot painting with the new process of carbon printing. This became Annan’s primary influence to become a skilled photographer himself. At a young age, learned the process of photogravure in Vienna on a trip with his father. This process allowed Annan to work like an etcher, sharpening, shading, or blurring areas of the picture, describing this process as “a long drawn out pleasure.” 
Fredrick Evan, responsible for leading the (Linked Ring) photography magazines, writing publications for the newspaper, and installing at Photo Salon. Regarded as being one of the most gifted and sensitive of "the Links" Evans is known for his images of architecture, specifically cathedrals. He is known to have spent weeks living in the cathedrals he photographed waiting for ideal lighting conditions to reveal the poetry in his subjects.
Frank. S. Sutcliffe, most well known for his image “Water Rats”, exemplary of being one of the first images showing depth of field accomplished in camera.
The Brotherhood represented themselves with a logo of three interlinked rings, which were meant in part to represent the Masonic beliefs of Good, True, and Beautiful.

Frankford Friends Meeting House

Frankford (Preparative) Friends Meeting House is a historic Quaker meeting house in the Frankford neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its oldest parts having been built in 1775–1776, it is significant as the oldest surviving meeting house in Philadelphia.
Located at the corner of Unity and Waln Streets, it is now used also as a community center.
The Friends meeting.
The Quaker meeting here was known from its establishment by the Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting in 1683 as "Tacony" (after a nearby creek), then as "Oxford" (after the township in which it lay), then as "Frankford", then as "Unity" (to distinguish it from another Frankford meeting nearby on Orthodox Street). It is affiliated with the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.
The historic building.
The original portion of the Frankford Preparative Friends Meeting House was built in 1775–76, making it the oldest Friends meeting house in Philadelphia. Although meeting houses were constructed in the region as early as the city's founding in the 1680s, most were replaced by the nineteenth century. Frankford Meeting House was originally erected as a single-cell, three-by-two-bay structure. In 1811–12, a smaller two-bay-wide section was added to accommodate the growing meeting. The addition also adapted the structure to a programmatic change that occurred among the Quakers during the late eighteenth century. Evidence indicates that a partition located to the east of the central doorway once divided the original single cell into two apartments. The smaller size of the eastern women's apartment reflected the English program whereby Friends met in a single room for worship, and then in separate apartments for gender-specific business meetings. By the late eighteenth century, American Friends began meeting on separate sides of a partition for worship and business, with the partition lowered for the latter. The new arrangement required two same-sized apartments and led to the development of the two-cell structure that became a standard for Friends meeting house design for nearly a century. Frankford's 1811–12 addition made the meeting house conform to the newer program by creating same-sized rooms, reflecting a critical point in the evolution of meeting house design. It is one of the few surviving examples of a single-cell form altered to accommodate separate space for women's meetings.
Frankford Meeting House is also of interest for its unusual mix of building materials. A refined treatment of Flemish-bond brick with glazed headers was used in constructing the facades facing the street. The use of locally quarried rubble stone gives a more vernacular appearance to the two remaining facades, including the south front. The utilization of both brick and stone was probably a function of economy. Materials from the previous meeting house were reused, minimizing the need for additional (more costly) brick, a practice indicative of Quaker thrift.

John O'Brennan

Dr. John O' Brennan is a political scientist and a frequent contributor to the international media. He lectures in European Politics at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM)and is known for his research on the politics of EU enlargement policy, EU external Relations and Ireland's relationship with the European Union. He is also the Director of the Centre for the Study of Wider Europe at NUI Maynooth, an inter-disciplinary research centre dedicated to analysis of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and their position within Europe.
Education and career.
O' Brennan graduated from the University of Limerick with a First Class Honours Degree in European Studies and later spent one year as a Visiting Fellow at the Varna Economics University in Bulgaria. In 2001 he obtained a PhD in political science from the University of Limerick and began teaching European politics in the Department of Government and Society. He was also awarded a post-doctoral fellowship by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences for work on the European Union's eastern enlargement. In 2007 he was appointed Lecturer in European Politics and Society within the Department of Sociology at NUI Maynooth.
He has lectured about the European Union in Bulgaria, Romania, the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom and has contributed opinion pieces to a wide range of international newspapers including the "Buenos Aires Herald" "Die Welt", "El Tiempo", "the Guardian", "the Irish Times", "the Japan Times", "the Scotsman" and "Open Democracy". 
He is also a regular contributor to the broadcast media including RTE Radio in Ireland and the BBC World Service.
Scholarly publications.
In addition to contributing articles to international political science journal such as the "Cambridge Review of International Affairs", "European Political Science", "Global Society", "the Journal of European Integration", O' Brennan is the author of two books about the European Union. The Eastern Enlargement of the European Union examines the normative and institutional foundations of the EU's enlargement policy and the practical politics which characterised the negotiations for the eastern expansion round. "National Parliaments within the Enlarged European Union" (co-edited with Professor Tapio Raunio) was published in 2007.
O' Brennan has also been an active contributor to debates on Ireland's relationship with the European Union and the problems presented by the failure of the 2008 Lisbon Treaty referendum. In October 2008 the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels published his article on possible routes to ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. O' Brennan argues that the Irish Government has little option but to hold a second referendum, and although there remains the possibility of Ireland gaining legal opt-outs from some aspects of the Lisbon Treaty, the better option would be to hold a second referendum on the simple question of whether Ireland remains a member state of the EU or departs voluntarily.

The Alaska Public Safety Commissioner dismissal, also known as Troopergate, involves the July 2008 dismissal of the Public Safety Commissioner for the State of Alaska by Governor Sarah Palin.
On October 10, 2008, the twelve-member bipartisan Alaska Legislative Council voted unanimously to release, without endorsing, the Branchflower investigative report, which found Palin had violated the ethics law covering state executive employees. The Branchflower report did not recommend a criminal investigation or sanctions. Under Alaska law, the state's gubernatorially appointed Personnel Board, not the Legislature, decides whether a Governor has violated the ethics laws. On November 3, 2008, the bi-partisan Alaska State Personnel Board released the findings of its own investigation which concluded that Palin did not violate any ethics laws.
Origin of the Conflict.
Sarah Palin, who in late August became the Republican vice presidential nominee in the 2008 United States presidential election, said that she reassigned commissioner Walt Monegan because of performance-related issues. Monegan said that his forced resignation may have been tied to his reluctance to fire Mike Wooten, an Alaska State Trooper who is also Palin's ex-brother-in-law. Monegan said that the Governor herself, her husband, and members of her staff as well as the state's Attorney General, had contacted him numerous times regarding Wooten. At the time Palin dismissed Monegan, Wooten was involved in a custody battle with his former wife, Molly McCann, Palin's sister.
Palin denied that there had been any pressure on Monegan to fire Wooten, either from herself or from anyone in her administration. In mid-August, Palin acknowledged that "pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it." She also apologized to Alaskans for what she called "this distraction."
Before Palin became governor, she and other members of her family had made various allegations of misconduct against Wooten. An internal investigation upheld some charges and rejected others. On March 1, 2006 the chief of the Alaska state police issued a letter of reprimand to Wooten, and he served a five-day suspension as penalty. After Palin became governor in December 2006, she, her husband Todd Palin, and various aides had further contacts with Monegan about Wooten. Monegan told both Sarah Palin and Todd Palin that the disciplinary proceeding against Wooten was concluded and could not be reopened.
Palin was investigated by an independent investigator, hired by a unanimous vote of a bipartisan committee of the Alaska Legislature, "to investigate the circumstances … surrounding termination, and potential abuses of power and/or improper actions by members of the executive branch." Palin denied any wrongdoing. Democratic state Senator Hollis French, who is overseeing the investigation, stated the report will "likely be damaging" to the Palin administration, and may be an October surprise. In response to those remarks by French, Republican state Senator John Coghill pushed an unsuccessful effort to have French removed from managing the investigation.
Todd Palin did not honor a September 2008 subpoena to appear in court to testify about his role in Troopergate. There were also two other key witnesses who failed to appear, and all three were originally referred to the full Alaska Senate for contempt. These contempt charges would not be addressed until the state Legislature met in January 2009, where the Legislature has several options including physically bringing the witnesses in, imposing jail time, or levying fines. With the refusals to testify, Senator Hollis French, the democrat chosen to oversee the charges, had to move forward with the investigation.
Palin's attorney general announced on October 5, 2008 that seven state employees will now honor subpoenas to testify in the legislative investigation of the Troopergate affair.
On October 10, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release, without endorsing, the Branchflower investigative report which found that Sarah Palin "abused her power as governor attempting to get Trooper Wooten fired." On November 3, 2008, the Alaska State Personnel Board released the findings of its own probe which concluded that Palin did not violate any ethics laws.
State Trooper Mike Wooten.
Background.
In 1999, Sarah Palin's sister Molly McCann and Mike Wooten began dating. In 2000, Palin wrote a character reference for Wooten. In 2001, Wooten became an Alaska State Trooper. Also in 2001, McCann and Wooten got married. In January 2005, they were separated.
Divorce filing and police complaint.
On April 11, 2005, McCann filed for divorce from Wooten. That day a judge granted a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) against Wooten. The same day, McCann's father Chuck Heath phoned police to inform them about the DVPO.
Also that day, police spoke with McCann. She said Wooten had threatened to shoot her father if he hired an attorney to help in her divorce. McCann said that although Wooten "has never physically abused her," he "acts very intimidating." She also accused him of using illegal testosterone supplements, drunk driving, and threatening to "take down" Palin if she got involved. McCann said she was "scared" of what Wooten "would do when he finds out she has hired an attorney."
Police investigation into allegations.
Based on McCann's complaint, the Alaska State Troopers began an investigation into the claims made, interviewing more than fifteen witnesses.
In May 2005, Sarah Palin told police that she and her son Track overheard a death threat against her father (Heath), in February 2005, when McCann allowed her to listen in on an argument through a phone line (speakerphone).
Palin said she had not called police at that time because she did not want to put Wooten's career in jeopardy, and the situation had not progressed to physical violence. On August 10, 2005, Palin sent an email to Col. Julia Grimes, chief of the Alaska state police, urging that Wooten be dismissed and giving more details about the alleged death threat. The email from Palin to Grimes said that the February 2005 threat by Wooten to shoot Heath came after McCann had accused Wooten of attending an event with another woman. In the email, Palin described Wooten as "a loose cannon" and "a ticking timebomb," and said that failing to fire Wooten "would lead a rational person to believe there is a problem inside the organization."
As a result of the email, Palin was interviewed again by state troopers on August 18, 2005. During this interview, she stated that she did not warn her father of the death threat until two weeks after it was made; she explained the delay by saying that Wooten had no reason to shoot Heath. According to Heath himself, the delay was a month: "Heath stated that his daughters didn't report the incident to him until a month later."
Divorce proceedings.
On May 9, a court hearing was held regarding the DVPO. At this hearing the DVPO was quashed because McCann's counsel was unable to produce evidence of any acts of physical or implied violence.
In October 2005, the divorce went to trial. During the trial, Judge John Suddock expressed puzzlement at the efforts of McCann's family to get Wooten fired, since it would harm his earning capacity and damage his ability to pay child support. Judge Suddock said "it appears for the world that Ms. McCann and her family have decided to take off for the guy's livelihood -- that the bitterness of whatever who did what to whom has overridden good judgment." A representative for the Alaska State Trooper's union testified that the union viewed the dozen complaints filed by McCann and her family against Wooten as "not job-related" and "harassment." Judge Suddock repeatedly warned McCann and her family to stop "disparaging" Wooten's reputation or risk the judge granting Wooten custody of the children. At a court hearing in October 2005, Judge Suddock said "disparaging will not be tolerated—it is a form of child abuse … relatives cannot disparage either. If occurs the parent needs to set boundaries for their relatives."
In the divorce decree that was granted on January 31, 2006, Judge Suddock expressed concern about continued criticism by McCann's family towards Wooten and noted that he would pay particular attention to problems raised by a custody investigator. Legal disputes between Wooten and McCann over custody, child support and visitation rights continued through 2007 and 2008.
Results of internal police investigation.
On October 29, 2005, Sgt. Wall issued a Memorandum of Findings describing the results of his investigation.
Death threat.
Wall's investigation report dated October 29, 2005 found that Wooten violated internal policy, but not the law, in making a death threat against Molly McCann's father Heath on February 17, 2005. Molly McCann, Sarah Palin and Track Palin said that he made the threat. Wooten said that he didn't make the threat. Wall decided that he had in fact done so. Wall concluded that the death threat was not a crime because Wooten did not threaten the father directly; therefore, Wall deemed the threat to be a violation of trooper policy rather than a violation of criminal law. Although the death threat was listed as a violation of trooper policy OPM 101.070(A) Unbecoming Conduct and OPM 101.070(B) Personal Conduct in the Memorandum of Findings, it was not mentioned at all in the suspension letter sent to Wooten by Col. Grimes on March 1, 2006.
Moose hunt.
The investigation found that Wooten had committed a hunting violation in shooting a moose without a permit: he had been out hunting with McCann in September 2003 and had shot the animal himself even though their permit was in McCann's name only. According to subsequent news reports, McCann had obtained the permit but balked at killing the moose herself, so she handed the gun to her then-husband, who shot the animal.
Taser incident.
Wooten was also found to have violated department policy in using a Taser on his then 11-year old stepson in 2003. He told investigators that he did so "in a training capacity" after the child had asked to be tased. In a September 2008 newspaper interview, Wooten said that he set the Taser to "test" mode, meaning that it was on low power. In a statement to police, the boy said "he wanted to be tased to show that he's not a mommy's boy in front of Bristol cousin, Palin's daughter. Following being tased he went upstairs to tell his mother that he was fine." In a statement to police, Molly McCann said "she was up stairs giving a bath to the kids … Mike was going to show Payton what it feels like and she told Mike that he better not." According to Molly's account, she remained upstairs during the incident.
Although the Taser incident happened in 2003, it was not reported to police until on or after April 11, 2005, the day McCann filed for divorce. On June 6, 2005, a police investigator asked Bristol why they "waited so long and brought the incident up after two years." Bristol said "because of the divorce and stuff".
Alcohol-related allegations.
The investigation initially cleared Wooten on all the alcohol-related charges, but Grimes overturned that result and found that Wooten did, "Take open beer with him when he drove away in his trooper vehicle," on one occasion in the summer of 2004, violating both the law and internal trooper policy. Wooten was not on duty; he was wearing "civilian attire." And he "drove approximately one mile to his residence." Because Wooten "was a member of the SERT team … he [was allowed to use his State vehicle for personal use." The only witnesses to this event were close friends of Sarah Palin's father: "Adrian Lane was a student of Chuck Heath's in Idaho when he was a child and they have been close friends ever since." This is apparently why the original Memorandum of Findings treated this allegation as "Not Sustained." Wooten denied this allegation.
Other charges.
Wooten was cleared of numerous other allegations made by McCann and her family, including that he had taken illegal steroid and testosterone supplements, that he had physically assaulted McCann, and that he had illegally shot a wolf.
Aside from the alleged death threat against Heath, Sarah and Molly had also accused Wooten of making threats that he would "bring down" Sarah and her family. Sarah Palin had no first-hand knowledge of these threats; she heard about them via Molly. Molly told police she understood Wooten to mean that he could use his position as a trooper to make life difficult for Sarah. Wooten denied making this threat. The police investigation treated this allegation as "Not Sustained."
Suspension of Wooten.
Based on the internal investigation findings, Grimes announced on March 1, 2006 that she would suspend Wooten for ten days. In announcing the suspension, Grimes referred to the Taser, moose and beer incidents, and also to seven other negative actions in Wooten's personnel file, such as failing to use turn signals. She did not mention the alleged death threat or any other allegations regarding threats. She concluded that "he record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times, illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period, which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession". After a union protest, the suspension was reduced to five days, and Grimes warned Wooten he would be fired if he committed any further misconduct.
Contacts between Governor's office and Wooten's supervisors.
In early December 2006, Palin took office as Governor of Alaska and appointed Walter C. Monegan III to be Public Safety Commissioner, a cabinet position. Monegan is a former police chief of Anchorage and son of Walter C. Monegan, Jr. According to the investigator hired by the state legislature, "Right about that time, a little after the swearing in," someone from Palin's office called Monegan's office to schedule a meeting between Monegan and Todd Palin, the governor's husband.
According to Monegan, the meeting took place in the Governor's office on January 4, 2007, with only Monegan and Todd Palin present. Palin asked Monegan to look into the Wooten affair. He gave Monegan various records, including material from a private investigator hired by the Palin family. Palin said that he disagreed with the five-day suspension, as inadequate and insufficient, and accused Wooten of a variety of transgressions, including drunken driving and child abuse. He asked Monegan to revisit the matter in light of some additional evidence he was providing. Monegan agreed to do that. He detailed some staff for the review, who made a page-by-page comparison with the investigation that had been done earlier, and told Monegan that there was nothing new. Monegan then told Todd Palin that there was nothing he could do as the case was closed. The troopers operate under a union contract that restricts the circumstances under which a trooper can be fired.
According to Monegan, Governor Palin raised the matter with him personally twice, in January and February, and then kept raising the matter indirectly through e-mails, though she did not again bring it up directly. In an email sent to Monegan on February 7, 2007 about a proposed bill to require 99-year sentences for police officers found guilty of murder, Palin mentioned Wooten as an example of an officer who violated the public trust. The email listed several examples of Wooten's alleged misbehavior. Another Palin email, dated July 17, 2007, concerned a proposed bill to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. Palin wrote to Monegan that her first thoughts "went to my ex-brother-in-law, the trooper, who threatened to kill my dad yet was not even reprimanded by his bosses and still to this day carries a gun, of course." A spokesperson for the McCain-Palin campaign says that Palin's contacts with Monegan were only to alert him to potential threats to her family.
Monegan also has said he got telephone calls from three Palin appointees: her then-chief of staff, Mike Tibbles; Commissioner Annette Kreitzer of the Department of Administration; and Attorney General Talis Colberg. Colberg said he called after Todd Palin asked him about "the process" for handling death threats made by state troopers against the first family. Monegan told Colberg the matter had been handled, and Colberg reported back to Todd Palin that nothing more could be done. In mid-August 2008, the Alaska Attorney General's inquiry reported that Palin's staff had made about two dozen contacts with public safety officials about Wooten, in 2007 and 2008, with more than half initiated by Tibbles.
In April 2007, Todd Palin told the "Anchorage Daily News" he had met once with Wooten's supervisor, Colonel Audie Holloway, to give her pictures of Wooten driving a snowmobile when he was out on a worker's compensation claim. Diane Kiesel, Alaska state personnel director, also called Holloway about the snowmobile incident.
On November 19, 2007, a meeting was called by Mike Tibbles, at the time Palin's chief of staff, to discuss the process of how Wooten had returned to work after a worker's compensation injury. Present were Kevin Brooks, the deputy commissioner of the Department of Administration, Nicki Neal, director of the Personnel Division, and Diane Kiesel, former director of Personnel and Labor Relations. [Frye (Ketchikan, Alaska - 2006-09-20).jpg|thumb|left|Ivy Frye, special assistant to Palin, subpoenaed in Troopergate.
On February 29, 2008, Frank Bailey, the governor's director of boards and commissions, made a phone call to trooper Lt. Rodney Dial, the state troopers' liaison to the Legislature. The Public Safety Department recorded the call, as it does routinely, and the Palin administration released an audiotape of it on August 13. In it, Bailey made several accusations against Wooten, including that he lied on his application to become a trooper. He was recorded saying "Todd and Sarah are scratching their heads, 'why on earth hasn't, why is this guy still representing the department?' " and "I'm telling you honestly, you know, she really likes Walt a lot, but on this issue, she feels like it's, she doesn't know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue. It's very, very troubling to her and the family. I could definitely relay that." Bailey said in an interview on August 13 that no one had asked him to make the call and he didn't know why he indicated in the call that he was speaking on behalf of the Palins. A transcript of the call is available.
Cell records show that Todd Palin spoke to Palin aide Ivy Frye three times on the afternoon of Feb. 28, the day before Bailey's conversation with Dial. About three hours after the last call, the first of ten emails began to circulate between Ivy Frye, Sarah Palin, her husband Todd, Bailey, Administration Commissioner Annette Kreitzer, Deputy Chief of Staff Randy Ruaro and Palin aide Kris Perry. The exchanges continued overnight and into the morning of Bailey's phone call.
Shortly before the annual celebration of Police Memorial Day on May 15, 2008, Commissioner Monegan dropped off a color photograph at Governor Palin's Anchorage office with a request that she sign and present it at the ceremony. The photograph was of an Alaska State Trooper, dressed in a formal uniform, saluting. He was standing in front of the police memorial located in front of the crime lab at AST headquarters in Anchorage, partially obscured by a flagpole. The picture to be signed by the Governor was to be used as a poster to be displayed in various Trooper Detachments around the state.
Shortly after he returned to his office from dropping off the photograph, he received a call from Kris Perry, Governor Palin's Director of her Anchorage office, who asked (according to Walt Monegan's testimony), "Why did you send a poster over here that has a picture of Mike Wooten on it?" Until that moment, Commissioner Monegan apparently never realized it was indeed a photograph of Trooper Wooten. Governor Palin canceled her appearance and sent Lieutenant Governor Parnell in her place.
At least three dozen people contacted Monegan's office over a 19 month period. Kim Peterson, Mr. Monegan’s special assistant and a 31-year human resources employee of the State of Alaska, said she fielded about a dozen calls. “It was very clear that someone from the governor’s office wanted him watched,” she told the "New York Times". Mr. Palin had called Ms. Peterson to claim that he had seen Wooten riding a snowmobile while on disability for a back injury and asked her to investigate. When Mr. Palin called back two weeks later asking for a response, Peterson told him that she could not discuss it because it was a confidential personnel matter.
Dianne Kiesel, a deputy director at the Department of Administration, called Ms. Peterson to suggest that Wooten could be reassigned to the cold-case unit or perform background checks. Ms. Peterson responded that those options would violate the union contract. Annette Kreitzer, Commissioner of the Alaskan Department of Administration, also called Monegan and Peterson about Wooten.
Dismissal of Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan.
On July 11, 2008, Palin's acting chief of staff Mike Nizich dismissed Monegan, offering him a position as executive director of the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, which he turned down.
In a letter to DPS employees announcing his termination, Monegan wrote that he was an at-will employee and knew his dismissal was, "A possibility ever present," and that he had been advised that the governor wanted to take DPS in a "different direction." In an interview the next day Monegan said that the dismissal had come "out of the blue" and that "f the governor was upset with me for one thing or another, it had never been communicated to me."
Response to the Dismissal of Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan.
The accusation that Governor Palin may have abused her power when her attempt to reassign Commissioner Walt Monegan resulted in his terminating employment appeared in the blog of Andrew Halcro on Thursday July 17, 2008. Mr. Halcro claimed that Monegan was "fired" because of his budget battles with the Governor and because he refused to fire Trooper Wooten.
Halcro's blog reported that Monegan thought he was going into the meeting to smooth over the ruffled feathers caused from when his deputy, Holloway, denied the Governor's chief of security, Cocerall, an extra trooper for security at the Governor's picnic. Instead he was fired. The legislators agreed to hire a special investigator to look into the issue to clear the air.
"That's the only thing I can think of, if you want to get to the truth and be unbiased," said Senate President Lyda Green, a Wasilla Republican. "Otherwise, speculation just continues."
Ten days later, on July 28, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council met and voted 12-0 to delegate their authority to the Council Chairman, Senator Elton, to hire legal services to investigate the termination of Commissioner Monegan. They named Senator Hollis French as Project Director for the contract. The report was intended that the 'investigation be professional, unbiased, independent, objective, and conducted at arm’s length from the political process'. The investigators report was to be submitted to the Legislative Council.
Senator French hired Stephen Branchflower to conduct the investigation. The contract was signed on July 31, 2008. Mr. Branchflower began his investigation on August 11, 2008.
Other responses to the Dismissal of Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan.
On July 17, Palin said publicly that "We have start recruiting. We have to start doing more than just talking about it. And taking action also." Monegan responded on July 18 that the two most recent trooper graduating classes had the most recruits in years. On July 18, Monegan suggested that his dismissal might have been related to his reluctance to fire Wooten. He said phone calls and questions from the Palin administration and the governor's husband, Todd Palin, about Wooten started shortly after Monegan was hired and continued until May or June 2008. Monegan said that Palin's acting chief of staff, Mike Nizich, told him on July 11 that he was being removed from his position because Palin wanted to take the Department of Public Safety in a different direction.
On July 18, in response to Monegan's comments, Palin released a statement: 
The statement also denied that the governor had improperly accessed Wooten's employment records, saying that "o allege that I, or any member of my family, requested, received or released confidential personnel information on an Alaska State Trooper, or directed disciplinary action be taken against any employee of the Department of Public Safety, is, quite simply, outrageous. Any information regarding personnel records came from the trooper himself." Palin said "absolutely no pressure ever put on Commissioner Monegan to hire or fire anybody, at any time … no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody." She also praised Monegan's replacement, saying "Commissioner Kopp shares my vision for filling vacant positions and reducing crime across the state."
In late July, former U.S. Attorney Wevley Shea, who had acted previously as an informal adviser to Palin, wrote her an unsolicited letter in which he urged her to apologize for "overreaching or perceived overreaching" to get Wooten fired, and warned that the matter could snowball into a bigger scandal. The letter said that she should fire any aides who had raised concerns with Monegan.
On August 13, Palin said specifically that her action was unrelated to Wooten. She said that Monegan was dismissed for not adequately filling state trooper vacancies and fighting alcohol abuse problems, and because he "did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues." Palin acknowledged that "pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it." She suspended Frank Bailey, and apologized to Alaskans:
On August 28, in an interview with "Anchorage Daily News", Monegan said, "For the record, no one ever said fire Wooten. Not the governor. Not Todd. Not any of the other staff. What they said directly was more along the lines of 'This isn't a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers.' " He later added that he had resisted pressure from the Governor and her husband to re-open the case against Wooten.
In an August interview with "The New Yorker", Palin blamed Monegan for failing to address alcohol abuse in rural Alaska. According to the "New Yorker" article, Palin stated that she didn't fire Monegan, but rather "asked him to drop everything else and single-mindedly take on the state’s drinking problem, as the director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board." Palin characterized the job offered to Monegan as "commensurate in salary pretty much—ten thousand dollars less," but said that Monegan didn't want it, so he quit.
In September, in a televised interview with Charles Gibson of ABC News, Palin reiterated her position that she had dismissed Monegan because of his job performance and that neither she nor her husband pressured him to fire Wooten. Palin said "I never pressured him to hire or fire anybody … I know that Todd, too, never pressured … Monegan." In response, Monegan said: "She's not telling the truth when she told ABC neither she nor her husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten. And she's not telling the truth to the media about her reasons for firing me."
Monegan has made a number of other statements alleging that he had been pressured to fire Wooten. "There was pressure for that, yes." "There were numerous contacts by the governor, her husband, by her staff that basically said that Trooper Wooten was not an acceptable example of an Alaska state trooper." "The fact that they tried for better than a year while I was there is kind of indicative that somebody was trying to pressure something."
On September 2, 2008, "a senior strategist in the McCain campaign" said "the man who was fired has said on the record that he was never pressured by the governor or the governor’s husband on the issue of firing Trooper Wooten."
On September 15, 2008, McCain/Palin campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton held a news conference at which she accused Monegan of "egregious insubordination," "obstructionist conduct" and a "brazen refusal" to follow proper channels for requesting money. Asked why someone with a history of insubordination would be offered the leadership of the Alaska Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, Stapleton said that without having to deal with a budget, Monegan would be able to focus on alcohol abuse issues. She added that Palin "respects the fact that he was respected in the community."
Monegan's successor, Charles Kopp, testified that during the July 9, 2008, phone call seeing if he was still interested the Commissioner's job, he asked why Monegan was leaving, and Frank Bailey told him that Governor Palin was upset by the episode where she was asked to autograph Wooten's photograph.
Investigations and reviews.
The Alaska Legislative Council is a bipartisan body of state House and Senate members who can convene to make decisions when the full Legislature is not in session. As of July 2008 it was made up of four Democrats and eight Republicans. On July 28, 2008, the Legislative Council voted 12-0 to hire an independent investigator to investigate Palin and her staff for possible abuse of power or improper actions surrounding Monegan's dismissal. A retired state prosecutor, Stephen Branchflower, was named as the investigator. Branchflower was awarded a three-month contract, which began on August 1. In the same unanimous vote, the Council also appointed Sen. French (D), a former state prosecutor, to manage Branchflower. French is Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Alaska Attorney General (internal investigation).
As a result of the announcement of a legislative investigation, Talis Colberg, the Alaskan Attorney General, and his Department of Law, began conducting an inquiry in late July at the request of the Governor. Rep. Ramras (R), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized the Colberg probe. "I think it is harmful to the credibility of the administration, harmful to the process and harmful to all the parties involved … it's just the worst possible thing to be doing." Ramras said Colberg "needs to be very careful to avoid his review having any appearance of tampering with witnesses." The findings of the review were made public on August 13.
The inquiry identified two dozen contacts by members of Palin's staff with public safety officials, concerning Wooten. Of these, only one was determined to be improper by the Attorney General's office. Palin said that she had only known about some of the two dozen contacts, and that she never asked anyone on her staff to get in touch with such officials about Wooten. Additionally, the Governor said that, "Many of these inquiries were completely appropriate. However, the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure, presumably at my direction."
In July, Palin had denied that there had been any pressure on Monegan to fire Wooten, either from herself or from anyone in her administration. Based on the Attorney General's inquiry, she said on August 13 that "I do now have to tell Alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although I have only now become aware of it."
Palin said the "most disturbing" contact found in the inquiry by the Attorney General and his office was the February 2008 phone call by Bailey to Dial. In a newspaper interview the day after the tape was released, Palin said she never asked Bailey to make the call, which she called "just wrong." She also denied that the tape showed the administration applying pressure to fire Wooten, saying "f that's pressure, then (after) years in law enforcement, how do they do their job if that's perceived as pressure?" A day or two earlier, Palin had said that Bailey's call appeared as a form of pressure: "It appears that he, though, tried to apply some pressure on my behalf."
On August 19, the Governor's office announced that Bailey had been placed on paid leave, pending the outcome of the legislative investigation. Sharon Leighow, a spokesperson for the governor, said that Bailey was kept on the state payroll so Palin "can direct him to assist Mr. Branchflower, thereby fulfilling her pledge to Alaskans to cooperate fully with the investigation."
State Legislature investigation.
On August 16, Hollis French said that the Palin administration has been cooperating and that subpoenas would not be necessary. In late August, French said that Palin was likely to be deposed soon in the case.
In mid-August, Palin hired a private practice lawyer, Thomas Van Flein, to defend her and her staff in the investigation; he began working on August 21. Van Flein was being paid by the State of Alaska; Attorney General Colberg was unable to represent Palin because of his involvement in the case. On August 29, Van Flein asked for all witness statements, documents and other materials collected in the course of the legislative investigation. French said, in response, that he had instructed Branchflower not to provide the letters or witness statements. On September 17, Van Flein said that he had, as of September 12, terminated his contract with the state, and was representing Todd and Sarah Palin personally. Van Flein said that the state would not be billed for any of his services since he was hired in August. Van Flein said that, after listening to Colberg's interview with Branchflower, he believes that Colberg is not a "material witness."
Scheduled completion date.
Branchflower's 3-month contract that started on August 1 was originally scheduled to end on October 31, and therefore the investigation was expected to end on that date. On September 2, French said the report would "likely to be damaging to the (Palin) administration," and could be an October surprise. In response to French's statements, Republican state Senator John Coghill launched an unsuccessful attempt to have French removed from overseeing the investigation, and suggested the entire investigation ought to be canceled, saying "if this has been botched up the way it has, there's a question as to whether it should continue." French apologized: "I made some remarks I should not have made. The point to remember is I'm not doing the investigation, Steven Branchflower is. He is independently gathering the facts and he will issue the report, which he will have to defend."
On September 5 French said that rather than ending on October 31, the Friday before the election, the report would be complete by October 10. House Judiciary Chairman Ramras (R) said the reason for the earlier completion date for the report is to avoid the appearance of a last-minute "October surprise." Other Republican lawmakers also expressed support for the earlier date.
French's "October surprise" remarks were used, in part, as the basis for a lawsuit that was brought by five Republican lawmakers, in an attempt to stop the Branchflower investigation. On October 2, Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski rejected this lawsuit, and defended French's right to make those remarks: "It is expected that legislators will belong to some party and will support the positions of their party, often publicly. The legislature is, by its nature, a political branch. It would be assumed that, e.g., review of Wall Street's financiers might be founded on a strongly held and expressed belief that somebody did something wrong."
Initial dispute over witnesses' testimony.
On September 1, French said the legislature would pay to fly Branchflower to wherever Sarah Palin was on the campaign trail if needed, and that Branchflower had not yet been able to set up an interview with Palin. In a letter on September 1, Van Flein indicated that Palin probably would not agree to an interview unless the legislature turned the matter over to the Personnel Board. If witnesses were not available, French said, he would ask the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, to issue subpoenas. He said that Palin needed to be interviewed sometime in September.
On September 2, the lawyer for Frank Bailey, the aide Palin suspended after a recording of his call to a trooper official came to light, canceled a deposition scheduled for September 3. The lawyer said that Van Flein, who represents Palin, informed him that there was a jurisdictional dispute that was unsettled. Bailey's lawyer also said that Bailey was ready to be deposed, and that Bailey would say that he wasn't asked by the Governor to make any calls regarding Monegan, but that the jurisdictional matter should be settled first. In response to this, Rep. Ramras (R), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said "Alaskans should be offended, that Frank Bailey is on paid leave and will not do an interview that he already committed to with Mr. Branchflower."
On September 9, Senior Assistant Attorney General Mike Barnhill wrote to Legislative Council chair Sen. Kim Elton threatening to go to court to confirm that it was legal for the Governor to assign her staff to review personnel files. He said that, if the lawmakers agreed that this interpretation of the law was correct, the Attorney General's office "will drop its objections state employees testifying and the depositions may proceed without subpoenas." On September 12, Sen. Elton agreed with Barnhill's proposal, writing that "I stipulate in my role as a chair of the Legislative Council and on behalf of the council that your interpretation of the law is correct."
Issue of subpoenas and response.
On September 12, the Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas to thirteen potential witnesses: Todd Palin, Ivy Frye, Randy Ruaro, Frank Bailey, John Bitney, Annette Kreitzer, Dianne Kiesel, Nicki Neal, Brad Thompson, Michael Nizich, Kris Perry, Janice Mason, and Murlene Wilkes. The Committee also authorized a subpoena for Bailey's cell-phone records.
According to Branchflower, Wilkes may have lied to him during an earlier interview, and may have had a financial incentive to cover up being pressured by the Palins to deny Wooten's worker's compensation claim. Branchflower said an employee at Wilkes' company had called a tip line and said "the governor's office wanted this claim denied." According to KTUU, "knowingly denying a worker's comp claim for false reasons is a criminal offense." Sarah Palin herself was not subpoenaed: Ramras said that it "would be disrespectful" for the committee to subpoena the governor while she was running for Vice President. The Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted to issue the subpoenas, is composed of three Republicans and two Democrats. The vote was 3-2. The subpoenas were authorized at a joint meeting of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The House Judiciary Committee also voted, in an advisory capacity, in favor of authorizing the subpoenas. This vote was 5-0. Those five include three Republicans and two Democrats. Two Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee were not present.
On September 16, saying that the investigation was "tainted" by manipulations from Barack Obama's supporters, a McCain-Palin spokesperson said that Palin would not cooperate with the investigator hired by the legislature. The Obama campaign said that the claim of manipulation was "complete paranoia."
On September 16, State Attorney General Talis Colberg, a Palin appointee, notified the Legislature that state employees would disobey the subpoenas issued in the course of the investigation, unless either the full Senate or the legislature as a whole voted to compel their testimony. He stated that the officials were "loyal employees subject to the supervision of the Governor" and cited Governor Palin's decision not to co-operate with the inquiry, her statement that the subpoenas were "of questionable validity," and the pending lawsuits challenging the investigation. He added that the employees were in "an untenable situation." The full Alaska legislature is not scheduled to convene until January 2009: it could not meet earlier unless a Special Session is called by Governor Palin.
In response to Attorney General Colberg's letter, Sen. Elton accused the administration of breaking an earlier agreement to allow the employees to testify. He cited several public statements by Palin or her staff pledging her cooperation, in addition to what he called the "explicit" offer in the earlier letter of September 9 to allow the testimony, provided that the administration's interpretation of the State Personnel Act was agreed upon.
Also on September 16, five GOP lawmakers from the Alaskan State Legislature filed a lawsuit in Anchorage Superior Court to end the investigation, claiming it was "unlawful, biased, partial and partisan."
On September 18, the McCain/Palin campaign announced that Todd Palin would refuse to testify because he does not believe the investigation is legitimate. State senator Bill Wielechowski said that the witnesses could not be punished for disobeying the subpoenas until the full legislature comes into session, which is scheduled to be in January 2009.
Allegation that the witness list was manipulated.
As evidence of her claim that the Branchflower investigation was "tainted," McCain spokesperson Stapleton cited the removal of former Palin Chief of Staff Tibbles from the subpoena list compiled by Branchflower. Branchflower had requested a subpoena for Tibbles because Tibbles was refusing to cooperate voluntarily. Stapleton said "French's further political involvement was accidentally revealed when the investigator testified that he had deferred to French on the proper witnesses to subpoena." On October 1, the McCain campaign said "Branchflower and French were recently exposed for colluding on the issuing of subpoenas." The McCain campaign also said "in a hearing, Branchflower admits conspiring with French regarding the recipients of subpoenas."
According to House Judiciary Chairman Ramras (R), it was his idea to remove Tibbles from the list: "we did not want to put that onus -- at least this was the point of view I put forward -- I did not want to put that onus on somebody who is now excluded from state service and would not enjoy the same legal protection that has been afforded to those members of the administration."
In response to charges that the Branchflower investigation is partisan, Ramras stated that the Chairmen and Vice Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees comprise three Republicans and one Democrat. All those four voted in favor of authorizing Branchflower's subpoenas. Ramras also mentioned "I have had a McCain sign in my front yard since August 21st, as soon as they hit town in Fairbanks." Responding to further claims of partisanship, Ramras said "the hyperbole from the truth squad campaign is a little farfetched … to those of us who have monitored this thing from the front-row seats, it's a misnomer."
Branchflower's interim status report as of September 12.
Subpoenas were authorized at a joint meeting of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on September 12. Branchflower was present, and reported on the interim progress of his month-long investigation. As of September 12, Branchflower had identified 33 potential witnesses, and had taken statements from 16 witnesses. He was also working with a large amount of material that had been produced by the Colberg investigation, and turned over to him.
Branchflower said there was enough evidence in the public record to support the claim that Todd Palin was the principal critic of Trooper Wooten. Todd Palin had many contacts with DPS personnel over the last several years and made many comments about how it appeared that DPS was not doing its job because of Wooten; he wanted Wooten fired. Branchflower described Monegan's account of his meeting with Todd Palin in January 2007. Palin said Wooten's suspension was inadequate. In a legal filing in September 2008, Sarah Palin said her family didn't learn until July 2008 that Wooten had been discliplined with a suspension in 2006.
Status of Branchflower's subpoenas as of September 19.
On September 19, French issued a letter detailing the status of the thirteen witness subpoenas authorized by the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 12. As of the 19th, six of the subpoenas had been served, to Todd Palin, Ivy Frye, Ruaro, Bailey, Bitney and Wilkes. The former three failed to appear on September 19, as ordered. The latter three complied with the subpoena by providing statements to Branchflower. The cell-phone company also was served and complied by providing Bailey's records.
On September 19, French announced that Branchflower would serve subpoenas on the seven remaining witnesses (Kiesel, Kreitzer, Neal, Thompson, Nizich, Perry, and Mason), with a return date of September 26.
French's letter noted that Attorney General Colberg's office had confirmed twice, in writing, that witnesses would cooperate. Colberg cancelled that cooperation agreement on September 16. French said that various subpoenas would have been served earlier, but Branchflower had been relying on assurances that had been given by the Governor and others that witnesses would be instructed to cooperate.
Court upholds validity of subpoenas, witnesses state willingness to appear.
On October 2, Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski rejected the contentions of the five Republican state legislators who had sued to block the investigation, and he also rejected Colberg's challenge to the subpoenas. In response, Colberg declined to discuss whether he would advise the subpoenaed state officials to comply with the subpoenas; he stated instead that he would need to consult with them about a possible appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court before commenting publicly.
On October 5, seven of the witnesses agreed that they would testify, leaving only the Palins' own appearance in doubt.
Branchflower Report and response.
The Alaska Legislative Council investigation concluded on October 10, 2008. After a full day of deliberation, the twelve members of the legislative commission voted unanimously to release, without endorsing, the 263-page Branchflower Report. The report included four main findings:
The report also concludes that Palin wrongfully allowed her husband, Todd Palin, to use state resources to pursue having Trooper Wooten fired, stating that "Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda..."
The report also recommended some clarifications of ethics statutes for the future. The third finding relates to evidence that Alaskan officials had informed the owner of the firm handling Wooten's worker's compensation claim that the Governor wanted Wooten's claim denied. However, the report finds that the claim was handled without regard to any attempt at political pressure. The report did not recommend any sanctions or legal penalties.
Palin's attorney issued a five page statement condemning the Branchflower report as misleading and wrong on the law. Palin responded to the report by saying, "About the Tasergate issue... I'm very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing, any hint of any kind of unethical activity there." This statement was criticized as inconsistent with the contents of the report by the media and by Democratic state senator Kim Elton.
State Personnel Board investigation.
Initiation.
On September 1, Palin essentially filed an ethics complaint against herself, asking the state Personnel Board to review the case. Her lawyer asked the state Legislature to drop its investigation, saying that by state law, the board had jurisdiction over ethics issues. Palin also asked that the Board review the matter as an ethics complaint.
The Personnel Board is a three-member panel appointed by the governor, and confirmed by the legislature. Members serve a six-year term, and not more than 2 members may be of same political party. The three people on the current board were first appointed by Frank Murkowski (R), Palin's gubernatorial predecessor; Palin reappointed one member in 2008. Another member donated $400 to Palin's 2006 campaign for governor. As governor, Palin has the authority to remove members of the board, for cause. The Personnel Board hired Anchorage trial lawyer Timothy J. Petumenos, a registered Democrat who contributed to Palin's opponent for governor in 2006, as its investigator. In 2002, his firm handled the $15 million bond issue for Wasilla's hockey complex, a pet project of then-mayor Palin.
In response to the request from Palin's attorney, French responded that "We're going to proceed. If they want to proceed, that's perfectly within their right but it doesn't diminish our right to do so."
On September 3, Nicki Neal, director of the state Division of Personnel and Labor Relations, said that the board would meet soon in executive session — closed to the public — to begin its work. Palin had asked for the ethics case to be open. Neal said she would check into how that relates to the board meetings. Neal is one of the persons listed as a potential witness in the Branchflower investigation.
Proceedings.
On September 15, Palin's attorney Van Flein filed arguments with the Personnel Board arguing that there was "no probable cause" to pursue the complaint that Palin earlier filed against herself. The filing accused Monegan of "an escalating pattern of insubordination on budget and other key policy issues," including a press conference appearance with Senator French, who is leading the legislature's investigation. Van Flein also argued that, even if Palin had ordered Monegan to fire Wooten, that would not violate Alaska's Ethics Act "because the public generally shares a common interest in public order and safety."
The September 15 filing said that a key matter was a planned trip to Washington DC by Monegan to seek funding for an initiative against sexual assault. The filing said that "the proposed Washington trip proved to be the last straw," and that she had not authorized the trip. On April 28, 2008, Palin had praised Monegan for his work in this area (sexual assault and domestic violence).
On September 19, "ABC News" reported that the governor's staff had authorized Monegan's trip, scheduled for July 22, 2008. ABC posted a travel authorization, signed by Nizich, Palin's Chief of Staff, on June 19, 2008, for the trip.
In response to inquiries about the travel authorization, the McCain-Palin campaign provided a statement on September 19 from Ruaro, the governor's deputy chief of staff as of September 1, 2008. Ruaro wrote that Monegan asked for—and received—approval for the travel without telling Palin's staff his reason for going. '"As a matter of routine, the travel was approved by Mike Nizich ... weeks before the actual purpose was made clear by former Commissioner Monegan,'" Ruaro wrote. On September 20, the McCain campaign said "Gov. Palin’s chief of staff authorized Monegan to travel to Washington … weeks before Monegan revealed the true purpose of his trip."
However, the September 15 legal filing contained a related e-mail: on June 26, 2008, Randy Ruaro, at that time a special assistant to the Governor, emailed Karen Rehfeld, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with a copy to Nizich. The email began "Walt and DPS want to make a trip back to DC in the end of July ... to get funding ... for work on sexual assault cases."
On October 13, 2008, Monegan asked the State Personnel Board for a hearing at which he could defend himself against Palin's accusations. Monegan's "Request for Due Process Hearing To Address Reputational Harm" set forth Palin's explanations for having dismissed him. It also stated:
Like all cabinet officers, Mr. Monegan served at the pleasure of the Governor and she could terminate him for any just reason or for no reason at all. But the Governor is not entitled to make untrue and defamatory statements about her reasons for discharging a cabinet officer. Governor Palin's public statements accusing Mr. Monegan of serious misconduct were untrue and they have stigmatized his good name, severely damaged – and continue to damage – his reputation, and impaired his ability to pursue future professional employment in law enforcement and related fields.
The Palins' attorney, Thomas Van Flein, stated that Palin and her husband would both give depositions on October 24 afternoon outside the state. As part of the Alaska Personnel Board investigation, with hired independent counsel Timothy Petumenos, each interview was expected to take up to 3 hours.
Police union ethics complaint.
On September 3, the police union filed an ethics complaint with the Alaska Attorney General's office. The complaint alleged that Palin and her officials had illegally accessed and disclosed information from Wooten's confidential personnel records. It said that the call by Frank Bailey, particularly the allegation that Wooten had lied on his job application, demonstrated knowledge that could only have come from Wooten's private file.
During the February 29, 2008 call, which was recorded, Lt. Dial asked Bailey how he had come across this "extremely confidential" information, and Bailey replied "I'm a little bit reluctant to say. Over in admin is where, you know, we hold workers' comp right in there."
The McCain/Palin campaign responded to the September 3 ethics complaint by saying that the privacy had been waived as part of the Wooten divorce proceedings, putting the information in the public domain, and that Bailey had received the information from Todd Palin, not from Wooten's personnel records, following Wooten's release on February 7, 2008 of his entire personnel file ("including all disciplinary action(s)") to his ex-wife's attorneys.
Final Report of Alaska Personnel Board.
On November 3, 2008, the Alaska Personnel Board concluded its probe and determined that Palin had not violated ethics laws, contradicting the earlier investigations. Tim Petumenos, the lawyer hired by the Board to conduct the probe, was quoted as stating in his final report, "There is no probable cause to believe that the governor, or any other state official, violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act in connection with these matters." The Personnel Board report also dismissed Monegan's request for a hearing and recommended that the police union (PSEA) amended complaint be dismissed. The Summary and Recommendations of the Petumenos report are as follows:
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. There is no probable cause to believe that Governor Palin violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act by making the decision to dismiss Department of Public Safety Commissioner Monegan and offering him instead the position of Director of the Alcohol Beverage Control Board.
2. There is no probable cause to believe that Governor Palin violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act in any other respect in connection with the employment of Alaska State Trooper Michael Wooten.
3. There is no basis upon which to refer the conduct of Governor Palin to any law enforcement agency in connection with this matter because Governor Palin did not commit the offenses of Interference with Official Proceedings or Official Misconduct.
4. There is no probable cause to believe that any other official of state government violated any substantive provision of the Ethics Act.
5. There is no legal basis or jurisdiction for conducting a "Due Process Hearing to Address Reputational Harm" as requested by former Commissioner Walter Monegan.
6. The Amended Complaint by the PSEA should be dismissed.
7. Independent Counsel recommends that the appropriate agency of State government address the issue of the private use of e-mails for government work and revisit the record retention policies of the Governor's Office.
These findings differ from those of the Branchflower Report because Independent Counsel has concluded the wrong statute was used as a basis for the conclusions contained in the Branchflower Report. The Branchflower Report misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all of the material evidence that is required to properly reach findings in this matter.
In early December, Palin's deputy press secretary said that the Board's report had been released because Palin had waived her confidentiality to release it, but that Palin would not release a transcript of her testimony on October 24. The governor's office also refused to release a transcript of Todd Palin's deposition and other key documents that were part of the Personnel Board investigation but not included as attachments to the official report.
Palin's views regarding the proper venue for the investigation.
Palin has made a number of statements expressing her views on the proper venue for the investigation.
Successors to Monegan.
Palin replaced Monegan with Chuck Kopp, who had been the police chief and, for a time, the acting city manager of Kenai. She had previously nominated Charles Kopp to the Alaska Judicial Council in April 2007, to which he was later confirmed and continues to serve. The Alaska Judicial Council recommends judges for selection in the state. According to the "Anchorage Daily News", Kopp "was a rising star in Alaska's Christian conservative movement." In Kenai, Kopp had been previously suspended and investigated for sexual harassment of an employee. Palin said she believed, when she named him on July 11, that the investigation had cleared him, and that she learned that Kopp had received a letter of reprimand only when Kopp held a press conference on July 22 to discuss that letter. Kopp resigned on July 25. He received a $10,000 severance payment. Monegan had received no severance payment.
Although certain reports indicate that Kopp was appointed on July 11, the actual announcement from Palin's office is dated July 14. The person who was sexually harassed by Kopp sent an email to Palin on July 14, 2008, very early in the morning before Palin made her announcement. The victim said "my sexual harassment complaint against Chief Kopp was acknowledged validated … by the City of Kenai." In a letter to the victim on October 10, 2005, the City of Kenai had said this: "As a result of our investigation, Chuck Kopp was removed immediately from his supervisory role relating to your position. … The City of Kenai will not tolerate harassment of its employees from anyone, regardless of his or her position." Palin later stated that when she appointed Kopp, she was unaware that he had been reprimanded.
On September 12, 2008 Palin appointed Joseph Masters as the third Public Safety Commissioner in a two-month period. Masters, a former deputy director of the Alaska State Troopers, had been security director for petrochemical operations for a private company. He replaced John Glass, who had served as acting commissioner. The "Anchorage Daily News" reported: "Asked if the governor discussed her vision of the department with him, said, 'Gov. Palin didn't give me any guidance or direction or mandates for the department.'"
As of mid-September 2008, the post of director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (the alternative job which Palin had offered to Monegan) was unfilled.
Areas of possible factual inconsistency.
In a number of instances, certain facts appear to be described in an inconsistent manner, when comparing multiple sources.
Allegations that Wooten is violent and abusive.
According to the Memorandum of Findings and the suspension letter, there was no finding that Wooten ever committed any act of violence against any person, other than the Taser incident. According to a police statement, McCann told police that Wooten never abused her. According to a police statement, the DVPO was dissolved because there was no evidence of violence.
According to various statements by Palin et al., Wooten is violent and abusive. Various statements reference the DVPO as proof that Wooten is violent. In a sworn statement, Todd Palin accused Wooten of "violent behavior" directed at four family members. On September 2, 2008 Palin said that Wooten was guilty of "violent behavior … directed against … my sister." On September 17 McCain-Palin spokesperson Meg Stapleton said Wooten "abused her [Palin's] sister." On October 9 Stapleton said "there are numerous instances of abuse." On October 10 the McCain campaign accused Wooten of "violent behavior" directed at four family members in 2005 and early 2006.
Threats against other family members.
According to the Memorandum of Findings and the suspension letter, there was no finding that Wooten ever made any threat of violence against any person, other than Heath. The alleged threat against Heath was witnessed by no one outside the family. The suspension letter did not mention that threat. Another alleged threat, to "bring down" Sarah and her family, was witnessed only by McCann, and she stated that she understood it was not a threat of violence, but rather a threat "to make life difficult" for them.
According to various statements by Palin et al., Wooten has made violent threats against various other members of her family, aside from Heath. For example, on September 15, 2008, Palin said Wooten had made "threats of violence" against McCann and Palin's nephew.
Threats subsequent to April 2005.
In September 2008, Palin described Wooten as "a trooper who is making threats against the First Family." On September 18 she again mentioned "his threats against the First Family." This seems to indicate that Wooten has made threats subsequent to the time that Palin became governor. However, Palin's September 2008 legal filings do not detail any threats that took place after Palin became governor, or at any time since April 11, 2005, when the divorce was filed. Palin's filing on September 1, 2008 said "no one in the Palin family ever filed a formal complaint," subsequent to the complaints the family made in 2005.
Branchflower said "Palin has stated publicly that she and her family feared Trooper Wooten. Yet the evidence presented has been inconsistent with such claims of fear … she ordered a substantial reduction in manpower in her personal protection detail …, an act that is inconsistent with a desire to avoid harm from Trooper Wooten … [Palin's] claims of fear were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palins' real motivation: to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family related reasons."
Branchflower wrote that in their first meeting with their security detail, the Palins were specifically asked if they knew of any threats against them. "They basically said no."
Duration and nature of the restraining order.
According to the DVPO document itself, the DVPO was temporary, with a nominal 20-day duration. It was issued presumptively on April 11, 2005, based on allegations made by McCann that day, in her written application. The DVPO document indicates that a hearing would be held to determine whether or not the temporary order should be extended into a long-term protective order. That hearing was originally scheduled for April 27 but actually took place on May 9. According to a police statement, the DVPO was dissolved at the May 9 hearing because McCann could not present evidence of violence.
On September 2, 2008, Palin said "the Anchorage Superior Court found that had engaged in serious, violent misconduct." According to a sworn statement by Todd Palin, the DVPO extended into 2006. On September 16, 2008 the McCain campaign said
"he is the subject of a Domestic Violence Protective Order," suggesting that the DVPO is still in effect. On October 10, 2008 the McCain campaign said Wooten was the subject of a DVPO "in 2005 and early 2006."
Awareness that Wooten had already been disciplined.
According to Palin, she and her family were unaware, prior to July 2008, that Wooten had been disciplined in 2006. For example, on September 1, 2008 Palin said that "Monegan never told Governor Palin or Todd about the discipline that Wooten received ... the parties involved had no idea how the matter was resolved ... As far as the Palin family knew of July 2008, Wooten ... had escaped discipline." In a sworn statement on October 8, 2008 Todd Palin said "the DPS never informed me or my wife that Wooten had been disciplined."
According to the Branchflower Report, Sarah Palin was aware that Wooten had been disciplined. Branchflower said Palin was "apparently intent upon getting Trooper Wooten fired in spite of the fact she knew he had been disciplined following the Administrative Investigation." In a sworn deposition, Monegan said that he did "mention Sarah Palin that the discipline had already been imposed on Mr. Wooten during the previous administration following an administrative investigation and that the matter was closed." Branchflower reports that Monegan "told Mr. Palin that the matter had been investigated, that discipline had been imposed."
The Branchflower Report includes testimony by John Glass, Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety. Glass testified that he told Todd Palin "that Wooten had already been penalized for his actions that he had taken." Glass testified that he gave the same information to Frank Bailey, Palin's director of boards and commissions. Glass told Bailey that "he should just leave the matter alone since Wooten disciplinary proceeding had already taken and that discipline had already been imposed and the matter was closed."
Allegations of misconduct against parties other than Wooten.
According to a statement by police, the DVPO was dissolved because McCann showed no evidence that Wooten was violent.
According to Palin, the DVPO was dissolved because Wooten's superiors intervened. According to Palin, the police investigation was "negligently or deliberately slipshod … investigators seemed more concerned about exonerating Wooten than protecting public safety or the Palin family."
Confidential status of Wooten's personnel file.
According to the police union ethics complaint, Bailey had improper access to confidential information from Wooten's personnel file. Palin responded by stating that Todd Palin had this information because Wooten had signed a release placing his entire personnel file in the public domain. However, Palin has also claimed that her family was not aware of Wooten's suspension until July 2008. Also, Wooten's release of February 7, 2008 did not place his file in the public domain. It only released his file to McCann's attorneys in connection with the divorce proceedings.
Claims about prior discipline.
According to the suspension letter issued by Col. Grimes, there had been three disciplinary actions against Wooten: a Warning, a Reprimand, and an Instruction, for such things as "not using turn signals," in the period prior to April 11, 2005, the date when the divorce was filed and a Domestic Violence Protective Order was issued.
According to Palin, "Wooten had been disciplined a dozen times before he was the subject of a Domestic Violence Protective Order from Molly McCann."

Gojko Šušak Avenue () is an avenue in northeastern Zagreb, Croatia. It serves as part of the boundary between city districts Maksimir and Gornja Dubrava. Spanning between Štefanovec Road and Dubrava Avenue, the avenue has four lanes and a parking lot along its western side. Its most important intersection is with Oporovečka Road. At its southern end, the road continues as the short four-lane Mandlova Road. Some of the most important buildings in Zagreb located on the Avenue are KBC Dubrava (also referred to as "Nova bolnica", "New hospital"), located on its eastern side, and the Police Academy, located on the western side. The avenue north of the busy Oporovečka Road is underused, but there are projects to make it a part of the inner city ring road and extend it to the route of the planned northern arm of Zagreb bypass. The avenue is named after Gojko Šušak, the late Croatian Minister of Defense. Before Šušak's death it was named Scout Alley ().

Ron Beitelspacher

Ron Beitelspacher (born January 25, 1945, in Hoven, South Dakota) is a former Democratic Idaho state senator. He finished second behind Larry EchoHawk in the 1994 Democratic primary for Governor of Idaho.
A resident of Grangeville and a lineman by trade, Beitelspacher represented North Central Idaho in the Idaho Legislature in the 1980s and early 1990s. He served briefly in the Idaho House of Representatives in 1979 after being appointed to fill a vacancy by Gov. John V. Evans. He was appointed to the Idaho Senate in 1980, again by Evans to fill a vacancy. 
Beitelspacher was elected to the Idaho Senate in 1980 from a North Central Idaho based floterial district and reelected throughout the 1980s. Towards the end of his Idaho Senate career Beitelspacher served as the ranking member of the resources and environment committee. He chose not to run for reelection in 1992 after floterial districts were eliminated.
Along with several other Democrats, in 1993 Beitelspacher announced his candidacy for Governor of Idaho after it became clear the Democratic incumbent, Cecil D. Andrus, would not run for a fifth term. Although most of the potential Democratic field dropped out after EchoHawk, the then-attorney general, announced his candidacy in early 1994, Beitelspacher remained in the race. Beitelspacher won a handful of counties in his North Central Idaho base in the May 1994 primary, but was decisively defeated statewide by EchoHawk.
In September 2011 Beitelspacher was chosen to co-chair a bipartisan committee to oversee redistricting in Idaho. The committee was convened after a previous committee failed to produce a redistricting plan.

Ivan Rerberg

Ivan Ivanovich Rerberg (October 4, 1869 – 1932, Moscow) was a Russian civil engineer, architect and educator active in Moscow in 1897–1932. Rerberg's input to present-day Moscow include Kiyevsky Rail Terminal, Central Telegraph building and the Administration building of Moscow Kremlin. Rerberg, a fourth member in a dynasty of engineers, was credited with innovative approach to structural frames and despised the title of an "architect", always signing his drafts "Engineer Rerberg".
Biography.
Rerberg's father, Ivan Fyodorovich Rerberg (1831—1917), was a railroad engineer who became executive director of Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod railroad. Founder of Rerberg dynasty came to Russia from Denmark in Petrine period, and since then first-born sons in the family always were named either "Ivan" or "Fyodor". Ivan's elder brother, Fyodor (1863—1938), became a painter.
Ivan was educated in a Cadet Corps, was commissioned into military engineers, and graduated from Saint Petersburg Academy of military engineers in 1896. By this time he had solid practical experience in building dams and roads. In the same year he dropped out of military service and joined the construction team of Kharkov locomotive works. In 1887, Rerberg was hired by Roman Klein as Klein's deputy for structural engineering on the site of Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. Rerberg worked on the museum site for 12 years (1897—1909) and was awarded an honorary title of its "lifetime architect". Simultaneously Rerberg managed other projects of Klein's firm — Muir & Mirrielees department store (1907—1908), Moscow State University expansion, Devichye Pole clinics (1897—1900s), Miusskaya Square college (1903).
In 1906—1909 Rerberg, still an associate of Klein, was gradually switching to independent work. In 1906 he won a contest for the first stage of a large apartment building in Meshchansky District funded by the estate of the late G. G. Solodovnikov. The second stage was designed by Marian Peretyatkovich; construction was managed by Traugott Bardt who completed the project in 1909. This building was styled in a mix of Victorian architecture and Art Nouveau; all subsequent work by Rerberg belonged to the school of Russian neoclassical revival.
In March 1909 Peretyatkovich and Rerberg teamed together to design the Northern Insurance buildings in Kitai-Gorod. Peretyatkovich soon left Moscow, and final, as-build, exterior of the building was shaped by Rerberg alone. This "modernized neoclassicism" project, completed in 1911, also employed Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky and then unknown trainee Ilya Golosov. Rerberg's career peaked in the five years that preceded World War I. He designed private residences (present-day Embassy of Indonesia), hospitals, colleges, a high school and a shopping arcade. His last work conceived before World War I, Kievsky Rail Terminal, was substantially completed in 1917; interiors were completed in 1920—1921.
In the period of economic collapse that accompanied the Civil War in Russia, Rerberg was employed by three major theaters of Moscow — Bolshoi, Maly and Moscow Art Theatre. In 1921—1923 he supervised emergency works on reinforcement of Bolshoi Theater foundations that were flooded by a wash from underground Neglinnaya River. Rerberg published proposals for a thorough renovation of Bolshoy, and these were slowly implemented under his supervision until Rerberg's death.
In 1925 Rerberg secured a contract to design Central Telegraph building in Tverskaya Street; the state clients initially opted for a public contest, but were dissatisfied with avant-garde entries and preferred to hire an old school professional. Rerberg's draft was authorized in March 1926, and the building was completed in 1927. Rerberg used reinforced concrete frame and moved all staircases outside of main building shell; this resulted in unusually spacious and well-lit open space offices, new to Moscow construction. Large public area actually accounted for only 4% of its 35,000 meters; most of the space was occupied by actual telegraph and mail-sorting equipment, while 20% were allocated to house the Commissar of Communications with his staff. Later, the space taken by equipment was gradually reduced in favor of offices.
Externally, the Telegraph mixed modernist structure of glass panes and granite-clad columns with classical symmetry and quality workmanship and attention to detail associated with Art Deco. The building caused an uproar of avant-garde critics but was praised by mainstream press.
Rerberg's last project, Military College in Kremlin (present-day Administrative Building of Moscow Kremlin) was completed after his death, in 1934.
His grandson Georgy Rerberg is known as a cinematographer.

Unbecoming Age, also known as The Magic Bubble, is a 1992 American comedy film starring George Clooney and Diane Salinger.
The film tells the story of woman who, for her 40th birthday, wishes to forget how old she is. A bottle of magic bubbles makes her wish come true, instantly transforming Julia into an ageless and happy woman.
Critical reception.
On her The Movie Archive Review website, Marjorie Johns awarded the film a score of six out of ten, stating that the film's "fantasy elements work well" and concluding that "it's a sweet natured, unpretentious little movie and not Scorsese".
Film critic Todd McCarthy of "Variety" based his negative review of the film on the fact that "the fantasy element...is exasperatingly tame", claiming that the screenwriters "have kept their imaginations too inhibited and domesticated where greater flights of fancy would have been welcome". McCarthy did agree that his "sympathy goes out to Salinger" for her ability to "remain somewhat likable" and that a "number of talented thesps brighten up the supporting cast" even though "few will count this among their more stellar credits".
Critic Peter Rainer of "Los Angeles Times" summarized his opinion with the opening sentence of his review titled "Magic Bubbles Can't Help "Un-Becoming"". He stated: "The comic premise of "Un-Becoming Age"...doesn't make a whit of sense"

Black Boy Island

Black Boy Island is an island in the River Thames in England between the villages of Medmenham, Buckinghamshire and Hurley, Berkshire. It is situated on the reach above Hurley Lock.
The island is said to be named after Charles II who was so dark as a child that his mother called him "Black Boy". Black Boy Island and the adjacent Frog Mill Ait presented a problem to navigation because the towpath was on the other side of the island from the main navigation channel. Hence tow lines had to sweep over the islands, often with the result that barges were pulled onto the shore.
The name "Poisson Deux" is associated with the area, and this is believed to derive from fish ducts or traps in the river here.

Harry Tuzo

General Sir Harry Craufurd Tuzo, GCB, OBE, MC (26 August 1917 – 7 August 1998) was a British Army officer who was Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe and GOC of the British Army in Northern Ireland during the early period of the Troubles.
Early life.
Harry Craufurd Tuzo was born in Bangalore, India, on 26 August 1917; the son of John Atkinson Tuzo, a British Army Officer and civil engineer, and his wife Annie Catherine (whose maiden name was Craufurd). Tuzo was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire (where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps) and Oriel College, Oxford, where he read jurisprudence.
Second World War.
He first entered the British Army on 15 July 1939 as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, Supplementary Reserve of Officers, just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. After a fortnight's training he crossed to France with the 21st Anti-Tank Regiment as part of the British Expeditionary Force. In May 1940, he was amongst the last of those evacuated from Dunkirk, travelling in a paddle cruiser to Harwich. He stayed with his regiment engaged in coastal defence until June 1944 when they returned to France in the Invasion of Normandy. His regiment was in support of the Guards Armoured Division in Normandy where he won the Military Cross (MC) for his actions up to Operation Goodwood (the breakout from Caen). He was then a war substantive captain and temporary major (United Kingdom) commanding Y Battery of the regiment consisting of self-propelled anti-tank guns, the original recommendation for his MC mentions his actions at the Albert Canal bridgehead, the attacks on Hechtel, Elst, Sittard and particularly in support of the Coldstream Guards at Wesel; he was slightly wounded three times during this period. Later in Germany he had the rare distinction as a battery commander of accepting the surrender of a German Admiral who was Flag Officer U Boats. As the end of the war approached, he was granted a Regular Army commission, with the substantive rank of lieutenant (with seniority from 24 February 1941), on 17 January 1945. He was Mentioned in Despatches on 9 August 1945, and his MC was gazetted on 22 January 1946. He received substantive promotion to captain on 1 July 1946. He had married Monica Patience Salter on 5 October 1943.
Borneo.
From 1963 to 1965 he commanded the 51st Gurkha Brigade in Borneo, which included Brunei in its area of operations. His Gurkha battalions worked to win the "hearts and minds" of the locals, but also participated with the SAS in Operation Claret which interdicted Indonesian troops as they attempted to cross the border. The Sultan of Brunei honoured Tuzo with the title "Dato Setia Nagara" in 1965. His work also earned him a Mention in Despatches.
Northern Ireland.
Tuzo was appointed as General Officer Commanding and Director of Operations, Northern Ireland on 2 March 1971 together with promotion to lieutenant-general. His appointment was made after the previous incumbent, Lieutenant-General Vernon Erskine-Crum suffered a heart attack. Tuzo was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 4 June 1971, in the Queen's Birthday Honours. In 1972, after consultation with Whitehall, Tuzo ordered Operation Motorman which sent 30,000 troops into Republican dominated 'no-go' areas of West Belfast and Derry to take back control. He relinquished his position in Northern Ireland on 1 February 1973 and was replaced by Lieutenant-General Sir Frank King. Tuzo was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 2 June 1973. 
After his service in Northern Ireland ended he was appointed Commander-in-Chief British Army of the Rhine until 1976 when he was made Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. He was placed on the retired list on 5 February 1979. After his service in the army he accepted a position in 1979 as chairman of Marconi Space and Defence Systems which he held until 1983.

<doc id="19096561" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19096561" title="2008–09 Scarlets season">
2008–09 Scarlets season

The 2008–09 season is the sixth in the history of the Scarlets regional side. The season will see the Scarlets compete in three competitions: the Celtic League, the EDF Energy Cup and the Heineken Cup. The season welcomes a change of ground, with the team moving from their home of over 125 years, Stradey Park, to a new stadium in Pemberton named Parc y Scarlets, as well as a change in the team name, dropping the "Llanelli" from their moniker to become the Scarlets.
Celtic League.
The Scarlets opened their 2008-09 Celtic League season away to Ulster on 5 September 2008. Despite playing against the wind in the first half, the Scarlets scored an early penalty in the sixth minute, before Darren Daniel scored the first try of the game, crossing in the corner. Clinton Schifcofske scored three penalties in response to make the half-time score 10–9 to the visitors. The Scarlets then took full advantage of the wind in the second half, Stephen Jones putting over two penalties to put the result beyond doubt. The Scarlets' next match came five days later, when they travelled to Rodney Parade to take on the Newport Gwent Dragons. The game looked out of the Llanelli side's reach at half time, as they trailed 25–6, but two unanswered tries from Martin Roberts and Nathan Brew, a conversion and two further penalties from Stephen Jones pulled the score back to 25–24. Brew came close to putting the Scarlets into the lead with 11 minutes to go, but fumbled the ball before he could get to the line, while Stephen Jones put an easy drop goal wide moments later. Fortunately for him, after Robert Lewis conceded a penalty in front of the posts, Jones finally gave the Scarlets a two-point win with three minutes left to play.
The team's next game came just three days later, at home to Connacht in the first of their final three games at Stradey Park. The Irish side opened the scoring with a penalty in the first minute, but those were to be their only points of the match as the Scarlets tore through the Connacht defence seemingly at will. Both Morgan Stoddart and Dafydd James broke the Connacht line before Deacon Manu scored the first try of the game, and then an almost identical one soon after to make the score 12–3 going into half-time. Two more tries came soon after the break, from Jonathan Davies and Nathan Brew, securing the try bonus point for the Scarlets. Man of the match Morgan Stoddart added two more before the end, with his tries separated by one from Mark Jones, to end the final Celtic League game at Stradey Park with a 45–3 win for the home side.
The Scarlets unbeaten start to the season came to an end on 19 September when they travelled to Scotland to play Edinburgh, losing 32–12. The loss meant that the Scarlets' run of being the only team not to beat Edinburgh at Murrayfield continued. It took 26 minutes before the first try came for Edinburgh, and it was not long before they added a second. They could have had a third just before half time, but Mark Robertson knocked on in the in-goal area attempting to gather a bouncing ball. The third eventually did come, however, as did a fourth before the midpoint of the second half. A Morgan Stoddart try was sandwiched between Edinburgh's two second half scores, and Martin Roberts crossed with a minute left to play, but it was too little, too late for the Scarlets. They then suffered a second defeat to a Scottish team in as many weeks with a 34–20 loss to Glasgow Warriors on 26 September. Despite taking a 12–0 lead in the first quarter of the match, the Scarlets found themselves 13–12 down at half-time and conceded another two tries before the 60 minute mark. Mark Jones scored a consolation try with eight minutes to go, but it was nullified by a last minute Glasgow try.
After a two-month break for the EDF Energy Cup, the Heineken Cup and the Autumn internationals, the Scarlets restarted their Celtic League campaign with a home game against Munster on 28 November 2008, their first match at their new stadium, Parc y Scarlets. The two sides exchanged a penalty each in the first quarter of the game, but it was Munster who scored the first try at the ground, Ian Dowling crossing in the 33rd minute. Denis Leamy then scored a converted try shortly before half-time, making the score 15–3 to the Irish at the interval. The second half was largely uneventful until the Scarlets made a late resurgence, being awarded a penalty try in injury time at the end of the game. However, it was not enough to overturn the Munster lead, the match finishing 18–16 to Munster.

EDF Energy Cup.
The Scarlets kicked off their 2008–09 EDF Energy Cup campaign with a 26–17 win away to Saracens on 5 October 2008. Australian Number 8 David Lyons opened the scoring for the Llanelli side, but Saracens responded almost immediately with two converted tries. However, the Scarlets took a 16–14 half-time lead through the boot of Stephen Jones. Saracens retook the lead soon after the break, but a Kees Meeuws try in the 48th minute secured the win for the Scarlets, while Stephen Jones denied the English side a losing bonus point with a penalty in the 63rd minute.
On 24 October 2008, the Scarlets hosted Bristol for the last ever competitive match to be held at Stradey Park. The home side got off to a perfect start, with Morgan Stoddart crossing the try line after just two minutes. Following lengthy analysis by the Television Match Official, Simon Easterby was awarded a try just before half-time, to take the score to 17–0 going into half time. A Stephen Jones penalty 10 minutes into the second half made it 20–0, before former Bristol centre Rob Higgitt scored to effectively put the result beyond doubt. The remainder of the match was spent with the Scarlets seeking the one try that would have given them the bonus point win, but it never came, and they had to be content with a 27–0 whitewash. The result put them in pole position to qualify for the semi-finals, although Northampton were still to play both Saracens and the Scarlets themselves.
Saracens beat Northampton that Sunday, meaning that the Scarlets needed only to avoid defeat to Northampton to qualify for the semi-finals. The match was played at Franklin's Gardens on the Saturday of the following weekend, and started at a blistering pace, with Regan King and Morgan Stoddart scoring tries in the first ten minutes. Northampton hit back immediately through Chris Ashton, who added another in the 29th minute. Ashton's two tries, in addition to a penalty for each side, meant that the half-time score was 13–13. Northampton started the second half the brighter of the two sides, and they took the lead for the first time when Bruce Reihana scored a converted try in the 45th minute.

Matthew Mayfield

Matthew Mayfield is an American singer-songwriter from Birmingham, Alabama. Originally the lead singer in the group Moses Mayfield, which disbanded in 2008, Matthew has moved on to a solo career. He announced the release of his debut EP, titled "The Fire EP" on August 25, 2008.
Not long after the band broke up, lead singer Matthew Mayfield started playing shows centered around the Birmingham, AL area, usually solo acoustic but occasionally with a new backing band. Within a year, he independently released an album of acoustic songs, including acoustic versions of songs that previously appeared on The Inside. He also revealed that Moses Mayfield called it quits mainly due to disagreements with the record label, as well as some members deciding they wanted to leave the band due to these disagreements. A combination of those two items led to the sudden break-up.
Between 2009 and 2010, Matthew released 5 additional EPs (each one with a free song) : "Five Chances Remain Hers" on July 27, 2009, "Maybe Next Christmas" on December 21, 2009, "Breathe Out In Black" on February 9, 2010, "Man-Made Machines" on March 16, 2010, and "You're Not Home" on April 17, 2010. After the 2010 SXSW Music and Media Conference, the music analytics website Next Big Sound ranked Matthew at No. 6 in its top ten list of the artists with the fastest growing buzz at the event.
In 2010, Mayfield independently released his first full-length studio album, "Now You're Free." The album broke the Top 20 charts in the iTunes rock category in the first week. Since that time, he began a heavy touring schedule with a full band, and a newer—more polished rock sound. With the release of the album, Mayfield has toured with such artists as Needtobreathe and Will Hoge. Several of the tracks of "Now You're Free" have been featured on MTV's Teen Mom, as well as The CW's Ringer.
In January 2012, Mayfield released on Facebook that he was in the recording studio and set to release his second full-length studio album on May 29, 2012. He has asked fans to go to a website named PledgeMusic to pledge money towards the recording and distribution of his new album; where he also give updates on his new songs and the album. The new album will be called "A Banquet for Ghosts".

Founded in 1925 by wealthy American philanthropist Charles R. Crane, the Institute of Current World Affairs is a Washington, D.C-based 501(c)3 which provides fellowships, allowing Americans under age 36 to live in a foreign country for two years. Their observations and research are published in monthly newsletters that are distributed to members.
Purpose and Recent History.
The Institute of Current World Affairs awards fellowships to young men and women allowing them to travel outside of the United States and gain an in-depth understanding of chosen topic areas. The institute is credited with launching the careers of notable foreign policy experts, including former U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Smith Hempstone, and the former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, Phillips Talbot.
The institute says it chooses young individuals that it believes possess the ability to make a substantial contribution to public life in the United States. The institute, which pays living expenses for fellows and their families, says it has sent more than 150 people abroad on its fellowship program. The work of its fellows have appeared in numerous national publications recently, sometimes with controversy.
In January, 2008, Nicholas Schmidle, working in Pakistan, wrote a Sunday magazine article for The New York Times titled "Next Gen Taliban." He was deported by Pakistan's government the day after the article appeared.
Many former fellows have gone on to notable positions, including some current board members. Author and physician Andrew Weil served as a fellow in the 1970s. Illustrator and author of several books about disease Bryn Barnard was sent to Asia by the institute. And Susan Sterner, a fellow in Brazil for the institute, documented First Lady Laura Bush as a White House photographer.

<doc id="19096847" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19096847" title="Socarrat">
Socarrat

Socarrat refers to fired clay tiles covered with a white base and generally painted in red and black. These were placed between beams and joists in buildings’ ceilings and eaves. Their origin is typically medieval but subsequent production of these objects is known, mainly in Valencia. There are other words to name objects with similar function such as rajola, maó prim, atovó or cairó.
The first register about its existence takes us back to 1604, when D. Feliciano de Figueroa, Bishop of Segorbe, refers to a group of roof and wall tiles written and coloured with koranic transcripts. Traditionally, they’re said to come from Paterna but the presence of these and other similar objects has been documented too in Manises and in some other places in Valencia, Aragon and Catalonia.
"Socarrat" can also refer to the crust that forms on the bottom of the pan when cooking paella.
Usage.
"Socarrats" were mainly manufactured in two basic sizes: the smaller with 30 x 15 x 3 cm and the larger with 40 x 30 x 3 cm (approximate measures). The first one could be used in buildings in two main ways: decorating eaves (the lower edges of a roof that project over the walls) either leaning on walls or on joists. They could also be used in ornamental friezes, in balconies and staircases. The largest tiles filled the space between joists on interior ceilings, with both structural and decorative functions, supporting pavements or roofs. The smaller size could carry out the same function. Socarrats were frequently reused to build new walls and levelling out pavements.
Manufacturing.
There’s a wide debate in what concerns to socarrat manufacturing. Being objects with ceramic base, controversy starts when one considers the stages that occur after drying the moulded ceramic paste. González Martí and Blat Monsó are the most representative authors on this subject.
According to González Martí, the dry tile should be covered with a kaolin based earth and painted with iron and manganese oxides. Then, it should be fired and the result should be a matte decoration.
The existence of a firing process and the nature of pigments were not always clear. Before González Martí, some authors have referred the lime used to decorate socarrats could not have been fired after application on the tile. Afterwards, Blat Monsó and others have reinforced this statement.
Iconography.
There are three basic types of representations in socarrats: religious, magic and social ones. The first one includes crosses and inscriptions, such as the koranic verses written on the socarrats of the Xara mosque in Valdigna. Fatima’s hands or Hamsa, boats, towers, animals and chimeric figures such as Butoni, a monster in the valencian imaginary are part of the second type of representations. The use of heraldic symbols and decorated elements made visible in public spaces and the representation of courtesan and satiric scenes fulfilled the third one. Socarrats were also used to do public announcements, such as the edict for recruit of soldiers of the Duke of Segorbe, in 1513.

NED was formed by EMMY© Award winning lighting designer, Jim Tetlow in 1990. The firm handles the lighting design for over 40 shows a year which include television specials, corporate shows & meetings, Vegas style shows and spectacles. NED is best known for their theatre consulting work in the cruise ship industry providing design and consulting services for over twenty-nine cruise ships with each containing sophisticated, multiple entertainment facilities for major showrooms, lounges, and dance clubs.

After viewing a show that Tetlow designed in Las Vegas in 1991, an executive from Carnival Cruise Lines hired him to light their shows on board a new ship, Carnival Sensation. Lighting design on further ships followed and in 1994 Tetlow was asked to consult on the entertainment facilities for Carnival Destiny, the first cruise ship in excess of 100,000 tons. Following that success, the fledgling company quickly expanded as they were called upon to now design all the new entertainment systems for most of the Carnival brands that includes Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Crociere, Holland America, Seabourn, and Cunard. As of 2008, NED has provided theatre consulting & design services for over 29 ships including the largest ocean liner in the world, the RMS Queen Mary 2.

CSS Industries

CSS Industries, Inc. was founded in 1923, as City Stores Company. Its headquarters is at 1845 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with showrooms in New York City, Memphis, Tennessee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Hong Kong. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes seasonal and everyday greeting cards and novelties.
City Stores Company, 1923–1985.
City Stores was a holding company, incorporated in the state of Delaware, that owned directly or indirectly all or a substantial majority of the stocks of several department and specialty stores in six states. It eventually controlled 39 stores in 19 states. The stores were serviced by a New York resident buying corporation, City Stores Mercantile
Company, Inc., a subsidiary wholly owned by City Stores. In the 1950s, City Stores merged with Specialty Stores Co.
City Stores started in 1923 with the acquisition of three department stores: B. Lowenstein, Inc., of Memphis, Tennessee; Maison Blanche Co., of New Orleans, Louisiana; and Loveman, Joseph & Loeb, of Birmingham, Alabama. The following year City Stores purchased Kaufman-Straus Co. of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1928, the company acquired a majority interest in Lit Brothers of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, later merging it into City Stores' operations in 1951. After going into receivership in 1931, City Stores Company could no longer meet its financial obligation to Bankers Securities Corporation (B.S.C.), the owner of Lit Brothers. Albert M. Greenfield was then installed as Chairman of the Board, a position he would hold for over 20 years.
In 1944, City Stores acquired control of R.H. White, a Boston, Massachusetts department store. In 1946, the company acquired Richards of Miami, Florida. City Stores purchased a majority interest in two New York based women's specialty clothing stores, Oppenheim, Collins & Co. in 1945 and Franklin Simon & Co. in 1949. The two companies were later merged as Franklin Simon & Co.. The company expanded its holdings of department stores with the acquisition in 1948, of Wise, Smith & Co. of Hartford, Connecticut and Lansburgh's of Washington, D.C. in 1951.
In 1961, City Stores acquired the W. & J. Sloane chain of 30 furniture stores in California, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and other states along the east coast. W. & J. Sloane purchased a building at a prime location on Fifth Avenue in New York City from Franklin Simon. In 1966, City Stores acquired Wolf & Dessauer Co. of Fort Wayne, Indiana, but sold the company in 1969, along with Kaufman-Straus to L. S. Ayres.
The 1970s brought the company a large decline in sales and the need to liquidate assets. The company discontinued operations at Lansburgh's in 1973, and Lit Brothers in 1977. After several years of low profits or net losses, City Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1979. Under the reorganization plan, City Stores closed 42 Franklin Simon & Co. stores, Hearns Department Store, and the eight Richards stores. In 1980, Loveman, Joseph & Loeb and R.H. White department stores closed and B. Lowenstein Bros. stores were consolidated with Maison Blanche.
City Stores was dismantled completely through the bankruptcy process after acquisition by Philadelphia Industries Inc. (PII). Jack Farber, president of PII, became chairman of City Stores and was elected CEO in February 1980. Farber closed or discontinued the remaining department store operations in 1982, and by 1985 liquidated the remaining assets of W. & J. Sloane.
CSS Industries, Inc. 1985–Present.
CSS Industries was established by Farber in 1985, with a new name to reflect a diversified strategy. CSS completed its first acquisition in January 1985 with the purchase of Rapidforms, Inc. of Thorofare, New Jersey. designed and manufactured a variety of business forms. It was sold in December 1997. In 1986, CSS acquired Ellisco Co., a manufacturer of metal containers in standard and customized formats. Ellisco's manufacturing locations included sites in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia. CSS sold the subsidiary to U.S. Can in 1994.
CSS added gift wrap and related products to its line of businesses with the 1988 acquisition of Paper Magic Group. Paper Magic designed, manufactured, and distributed seasonal and everyday paper products for gift giving and holiday celebrations. The company also obtained licenses to produce certain products with imprints of cartoon characters, including Care Bears, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Walt Disney characters. In 1991, Paper Magic acquired Spearhead Industries of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a manufacturer of Halloween and Easter products. In 1995 Paper Magic acquired Cleo, Inc., a manufacturer of gift wrap and trim, primarily for the Christmas season, as well as Topstone Industries, Inc., a manufacturer of Halloween products and novelties, and Illusive Concepts, a manufacturer of latex masks, accessories and decorative displays.
In 1993, CSS acquired Berwick Industries, Inc., a ribbon and bow manufacturer and integrated it into Paper Magic. In March 2002, Berwick acquired business assets of C. M. Offray & Son, Inc. (a producer and supplier of narrow woven ribbon) and merged them into Berwick. In August 2008, Berwick Offray LLC acquired Hampshire Paper Corp., a manufacturer and supplier of waxed tissue, paper, foil and foil decorative packaging to the wholesale floral and horticultural industries.
In the mid-2000s, CSS was reorganized into three affiliates: Berwick Offray (the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of decorative ribbons and bows); Cleo (the premier provider of seasonal gift packaging products); and the Paper Magic Group (a manufacturer of a vast array of seasonal merchandise - ranging from greeting cards to Halloween costumes). The C. R. Gibson business was acquired on December 3, 2007, and in May 2008, it acquired iota, a designer, marketer and seller of stationery products, such as note cards, gift wrap and journals. CSS announced on May 25, 2011 that Cleo would be shut down as of December 31, 2011.

Original Rags

"Original Rags" (copyrighted 15 March 1899) was an early ragtime medley for piano.
It was the first of Scott Joplin's rags to appear in print, in early 1899, preceding his "Maple Leaf Rag" by half a year.
Publication history.
The tune's copyright was registered on March 15, 1899, and it was first published by Carl Hoffman of Kansas City, Missouri. The original cover page showed an old man picking up rags in front of a ramshackle cabin, and has been interpreted as a double pun, first on the activities of a rag (or junk) picker, and second on a slang term for ragtime, "picking the piano". The rag was given the following credits:
It is not known whether Charles N. Daniels actually arranged the piece, or merely transcribed it. Joplin biographer Rudi Blesh thought it more likely that the credit to Daniels was the publisher's way of acknowledging his help in recommending the piece for publication; Blesh wrote that the music was "unmistakably Joplin" in style.
Structure.
The composition has the following musical structure:
The rag is not in the sequence "AA BB A CC DD" more typical of Joplin. Like the posthumously published "Reflection Rag", it features five themes, but the "Original Rag" delays reentry of the first theme until after the modulation. The piece is mostly in G major except for the "C" section, which is in C major, and the "D" section (marked "Brilliant" in the sheet music), which is in D major. Ragtime historians have commented on the harmonic similarity between the "D" section of "Original Rags" and the "A" section of H. O. Wheeler's "A Virginny Frolic" published by Carl Hoffman the year before. Blesh appreciated it as "a charming and auspicious beginning to the life work of the master ragtime composer".

Camille du Locle

Camille du Locle (16 July 18329 October 1903) was a French theatre director and a librettist. He was born in Orange, France. From 1862 he served as assistant to his father-in-law, Émile Perrin at the Paris Opéra, moving in 1870 to the Opéra-Comique (he was co-director (with Adolphe de Leuven) in the Opéra-Comique).
He is best remembered for mounting the original production of Bizet's "Carmen" in 1875. His friendship with Ernest Reyer led to him providing libretti for "Sigurd" and "Salammbô". Du Locle was responsible for completing the libretto of "Don Carlos" after the death of Joseph Méry. He also played a key role in the genesis of "Aida" in 1869-70. In 1876, a financial dispute arose with Verdi, and Du Locle moved to Capri. He lived in what is called today “Villa Certosella”.
According to Charles Pigot, Du Locle inspired the subject, words and music of Bizet's "Djamileh". He was a pall-bearer at Bizet's funeral and made a speech at his interment at Père Lachaise.
Du Locle died in Capri.

Spider's Web (film)

"Spider's Web" () is a 1989 West German film directed by Bernhard Wicki. It is based on the eponymous 1923 novel by Joseph Roth. It was chosen as West Germany's official submission to the 62nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not manage to receive a nomination. The film was the last ever submission by West Germany, due to German reunification in 1990, Germany competed at the 63rd Academy Awards as a single country.
The film was also entered into the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.
Plot.
The film centers on young right-wing Leutnant (lieutenant) Theodor Lohse (Ulrich Mühe) who suffers personal and national humiliation during the downfall of the German Empire and the subsequent German Revolution of 1918 as the aftermath of World War I, from whence on he pledges revenge on all those he blames for the new times: Democrats, socialists, and Jews. Thus, he becomes increasingly active in the right-wing underground of the early Weimar Republic, joining an organization called "S II" (probably based on real-life "Organisation Consul" that was responsible for a number of political and anti-Semitic assassinations) where his immediate superior is Baron von Rastchuk (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Baron von Rastchuk brings Lohse in contact with former Crown Prince Heinrich in order to get Lohse employed, a favor for which the homosexual Prince demands one-time bodily obligingness from Lohse. In spite of his apparent shock and disgust, Lohse yields to the Prince out of his opportunism and willingness to please his superiors.
Lohse becomes a full-time spy for the organization, and with unprecedented, relentless opportunism and unscrupulousness he spies in on Communist plots, partakes in the organization's plans to undermine the new German democracy, and disposes of his own right-wing colleagues when he sees fit, all of which to serve his own plans of rising to the top within right-wing circles. During these activities he comes in contact with Benjamin Lenz (Klaus Maria Brandauer), a Jewish man dealing in informations on all kinds of criminal and underground political proceedings who will always sell at the highest price, be it paid by left or right-wing conspirators or the police. In spite of Lohse's hatred of Jews, he finds Lenz's services useful, but soon finds himself at his mercy as Lenz through their collaboration finds out more and more about Lohse's schemes and spy activities.
When Lenz learns that Lohse ordered a pogrom of the local Jewish ghetto, he confronts the rather short and slim-built Lohse in private, beating him close to senselessness and almost forces Lohse to commit suicide by jumping out of a window, until he realizes that killing Lohse would not make him any better than the anti-Semite that had ordered the violence in the ghetto. Lohse then has his henchmen murder Lenz, also because he knew too much, by pushing him in front of an approaching train. The film ends in late 1923 with Lohse leaving a festivity of conservatives and monarchists, declaring that restoring the monarchy has by now become "old hat", and with glowing eyes he mentions a "new man" preparing a putsch in Munich to count on - a man named Adolf Hitler.

Career.
Santos represented Brazil at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She competed at the 4x100 metres relay together with Lucimar de Moura, Thaissa Presti and Rosemar Coelho Neto. In their first round heat they placed third behind Belgium and Great Britain, but in front of Nigeria. Their time of 43.38 seconds was the fifth time overall out of sixteen participating nations.

At Daegu 2011, Rosangela went to the 4x100m final, ranking eighth - with a new South American record (42.92) at the preliminary.
Integrating the delegation that disputed the 2011 Pan American Games, in Guadalajara, she won the gold medal in the 100m, beating her personal record with a time of 11.22 seconds. She was only the second Brazilian in history to win this race in Pan Am Games. She also won the 4x100 meters relay alongside Vanda Gomes, Franciela Krasucki and Ana Claudia Lemos, with a time of 42.85, breaking the South American record.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Rosângela went to the semifinals of the 100m, with a mark of 11.07 s, which just was not approved as a South American record due to +2,2 wind (the maximum allowed for approval of record is +2.0). In the semifinal, she came in 3rd place in her battery (losing to Carmelita Jeter and Veronica Campbell-Brown, who advanced to the final, and won silver and bronze medals), obtaining the 11.17 mark, ranking 12th overall. She was the first Brazilian woman to achieve Olympic spot in the semifinals of this test.
Still in London, the Brazilian 4x100m relay women team, composed by Ana Cláudia Lemos, Franciela Krasucki, Evelyn dos Santos and Rosangela Santos broke the South American record in the qualifying of the race, with a time of 42.55, and went to the final in sixth place. In the final, the Brazilian relay did 42.91 and finished 7th.
At the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, the team composed by Ana Cláudia Lemos, Evelyn dos Santos, Franciela Krasucki and Rosângela Santos broke the South American record in the semifinals of the women's 4x100m metres relay, with a time of 42.29 seconds. But, strangely and without official explanation, the CBAT (Brazilian Athletics Confederation) held a bizarre athlete change to the final, putting Vanda Gomes (who had never run the relay) instead of Rosangela Santos, to close the race. In the final, Brazil came second, almost tied with Jamaica and with great possibility to win the silver medal, and knock the South American record when, at the last bat exchange, Vanda, who had been placed "in fire" in a World Championships final and without sufficient training to receive the baton, eventually leaving the baton fall.
Santos has dual citizenship American and Brazilian.

The Last Time (film)

The Last Time is a 2006 independent film starring Michael Keaton, Brendan Fraser and Amber Valletta.
Plot.
Ted Ryker (Michael Keaton) is the top salesman in the New York office of business machine company Bineview. The corporate stock lives by quarterly sales numbers, the competition is very intense, and the economy may be headed into a downturn. Ted's company is marking time until a revolutionary new product is ready, probably within a few months. Some competitors may know something about this secret innovation, through industrial espionage, and fear its impact on the market. 
A new company hire, callow Midwesterner Jamie Bashant (Brendan Fraser), has moved east with his lovely fiancée Belisa (Amber Valletta). Jamie and Belisa are a young couple just starting out, and Jamie has to learn the business as a trainee. Ted is very successful, but also cynical, hard-driving, profane, obnoxious, abusive, and a lousy team player. He has few if any friends in the company, but his shortcomings are tolerated because his output is so outstanding. Ted, assigned to train Jamie, watches Jamie struggle, failing with presentation after presentation; Ted tries, in vain, to help Jamie improve his performance and make a few sales, even giving one of his own sure deals to Jamie, who messes it up. Bashant and Ryker head to the sales conference and Ryker runs into Leguzza. Then, Ted is introduced to Belisa through normal company friendship, and discovers a strong mutual attraction to her. Belisa is impressed by Ted's success and confident manner. The two then have sex, and do their best to keep this secret from Jamie, who is worried about being fired because of his weak output. Ted and Belisa then meet at a café and go to Ted's place and sleep with each other, before going to Las Vegas, winning gambling games and having sex in a hotel room. Ted confesses to Belisa that he has a failed love in his past, which affected him very deeply, leading to a career switch from college literature professor at Northwestern University near Chicago (a job he loved) to hard-driving star salesman in New York. Belisa does her best to comfort him. Later that night in bed the two discover a shared interest in Oscar Wilde's novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray", which Belisa studied at college.
Ted spends increasingly more time with Belisa and away from the office. Ted is falling hard for Belisa, who postpones her wedding to Jamie; the couple had planned a honeymoon to Jamaica. But Ted's sales performance is dropping dramatically, and since his contribution to the company's profit is so important, the rest of the sales force feels even more pressure. Branch manager John Whitman (Daniel Stern) has prospered with Ted's performance, but starts losing confidence in Ted, and is mystified at Ted's lack of dedication, such a contrast from his previous strong effort. Belisa seems ready to end her engagement to Jamie in favor of Ted, as the two travel to Atlantic City for a getaway from the stress, and use Jamie's week-long absence at a training conference to deepen their relationship. However, the company is in trouble from plummeting sales, not just in New York but at its other locations as well, and downsizing and firings are imminent. Just as Ted's love life is prospering, his career is sinking. He no longer cares about his career; he avoids the office, doesn't answer his phone or return messages, fails to close several critical deals, and this drives the company closer to ruin. However, his relationship with Belisa, who now promises to leave Jamie and get married to Ted, is creating real change in his life, healing his bitterness. Jamie, showing no improvement whatsoever in his job performance is fired just as Belisa breaks their engagement and asks him to move out. He becomes suspicious that Belisa is cheating on him and nears a nervous breakdown. Belisa becomes very concerned and meets with Ted to break off their affair so she can take care of Jamie, informing him they are returning to Ohio together tomorrow. Ted is devastated at Belisa's change of heart, but finally returns to the office the next day to find manager Whitman desperate for him to make some sales as his own career is on the line. Belisa surprises Ted in the parking lot, telling him Jamie went back to Ohio, but she has decided to stay in New York to be with him.
Ted goes to the office to find the company has been taken over by a competing firm that was able to buy the company cheap because poor sales at all the offices lowered the stock price drastically. The office is being closed with dozens of staff personnel being fired, including Manager Whitman. Despite the news, Ted is happy and leaves to go see Belisa at her home. When he gets there she is gone and her house is now empty except for a few boxes stacked in the living room. In the boxes Ted finds evidence that Jamie and Belisa were actually working together to destroy his sales performance. Jamie and Belisa are seen at a party with the president of the competing firm which has just purchased Bineview. It is revealed that the bumbling Jamie is actually a ruthless leader of a team of double agents sent by this competing firm to infiltrate Bineview. The top salesperson at each office has been targeted by one of the double agents, each having their sales performance ruined in different ways, as part of a strategy to weaken the company in preparation for this corporate takeover. 
Leguzza explains how he desired to purchase a company but wanted to get it at a cheap price. So he put together a group to cull the company the animals in order to weaken their sales to he would be able to purchase the company. As Jamie explains how he and Belisa were able to distract Ted, destroying his sales performance, his gloating clearly disgusts Belisa who appears to have real feelings for Ted. She leaves the party to go to Ted who is seen packing up all his belongings. Jamie confronts his true employer, the corporate shark who masterminded the whole stratagem to gain control of a new, innovative, Bineview business machine, and demands his money using knowledge of the employer's embarrassing sexual proclivity as blackmail. When Belisa arrives at Ted's loft he is already gone, so she goes to her home to find him. As Ted is shown on the road to an unknown destination, she discovers a personal message from Ted in a volume of Wilde's novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray" which he has left behind for her. With the knowledge that Ted knows the truth and wants nothing to do with her, Belisa is left broken-hearted. The movie closes with a smiling and contented Ted arriving at Northwestern University to return to the job he truly loves, teaching.
Production.
"The Last Time" was filmed in August 2005 in New Orleans, Louisiana, and New York City, New York, on a budget of roughly $4,000,000. The film was released in theaters in May of 2007.

Walpen Chine

Walpen Chine is a geological feature on the south west coast of the Isle of Wight, England. It is west of the village of Chale. It is a sandy coastal ravine, one of a number of such chines on the island created by stream erosion of soft Cretaceous rocks. It leads from the 190 feet high clifftop next to the Isle of Wight coastal path to a knickpoint approximately halfway down the cliff face above Chale Bay beach.
The Chine is one of three chines that have been eroded by a small unnamed brook that descends from Chale that drains rainwater from the west side of St. Catherine's Hill. The other two chines are Ladder Chine and New Chine. The brook initially wound its way to the cliff face and its descent over the edge created Ladder chine. As the cliff eroded, the brook found a shorter path to the sea and started creating Walpen Chine to the east of Ladder chine. As the cliff eroded further, the brook moved east again and is currently eroding an unnamed chine labelled New Chine.
Ladder and Walpen Chines are both now dry and in Walpen chine the river bed can be seen heading back uphill to the cliff edge.

Career.
Early career.
Squadron served as a consultant to New York City's Department of Education for six months and spent a few years a special assistant to U.S. Senator Charles Schumer. It was during this time that he helped the New York senator on the book: "Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time"".
State Senate.
Squadron ran for the 25th district of the New York State Senate in 2008. He received the endorsements of Congressman Anthony Weiner, mentor Senator Schumer, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Assisted by family friends, Schumer supporters and an aggressive campaign strategy, Squadron defeated Connor and took 54% of the vote. Squadron campaigned on a platform of preventing residential development of Brooklyn Bridge Park. He negotiated a deal that did not fully eliminate housing in the park but reduced it in size and scope and has been credited with reducing and delaying the amount of luxury housing and returning $11 million in capital funding that had been cut from the park's budget by the city. For his run for public advocate Squadron has received $65,000 from the park's development groups.
In 2010, he voted to expand and regulate charter schools in New York State, helping to pass the education law amendments that allowed for this. In January 2011, the "New York Daily News" reported that he had exceeded the rent limit imposed by state senate leadership on his lower Broadway office by $100,000 over a period of two years. On November 6, 2012, Squadron was elected to the state senate again, this time to represent the 26th district. He beat his Republican opponent, J. Haro, 86% to 14%.
Race for New York City public advocate.
In the race for Public Advocate, Squadron had the endorsements of mentor Senator Chuck Schumer, former Public Advocates Betsy Gotbaum and Mark Green. According to his campaign website, Squadron was also endorsed by Congressman Jose Serrano, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, State Senators Bill Perkins, Brad Hoylman, Tony Avella, Adriano Espillat, Mike Gianaris, Jose Peralta, Gustavo Rivera, Jose Serrano, Assembly Members Alec Brook-Krasny, Deborah Glick, Dan Quart, Joan Millman, Mike Cusick, Jeff Dinowitz, Aravella Simotas, Luis Sepulveda, and Gabriella Rosa, Council Members Ydanis Rodriguez, James Vacca, the New York Times, and the Empire State Pride Agenda. Squadron also received support from Brooklyn developers Joe Sitt, Bruce Ratner and individual campaign contributions from Suroosh Alvi, Shane Smith, Eddy Moretti and Alex Detrick.
According to the online newssite "Capital", Squadron fired a campaign consultant in February 2013 during her father's wake. After "venting her frustration" in an public email to Squadron, the individual donated to the campaigns of his public-advocate rivals. Squadron placed second in the primary and advanced to an October 2013 runoff primary which cost the city $13 million. He lost to Letitia James in a landslide, 41% to her 59%.
Personal life.
Squadron is married to Elizabeth Weinstein, a director in Mayor Bloomberg's Office of Operations. The couple were set up by Schumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, for whom Weinstein worked as chief of staff at the New York City Department of Transportation. Squadron lives in Carroll Gardens with his wife and son.
According to Squadron, a trust fund, established for him and 18 other family members was lost in the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme. Squadron's brother Seth and step-sister Diane, sued their mother for her handling of the fund after Howard Squadron's death. Squadron and his relatives have also been named in one of a series of 1,000 "clawback" claims "filed by a Madoff bankruptcy trustee" but Squadron and his relatives have "not been accused of any wrongdoing".

Some Candy Talking

Some Candy Talking is an extended play (EP) by the Scottish rock band The Jesus & Mary Chain, released in 1986. Its track listing included "Taste of Cindy", a song from their first album, "Psychocandy" performed acoustically, and a song entitled "Psychocandy", which did not appear on that album.
The title track is commonly misunderstood as being about heroin use. In a 2005 interview with Jim Reid (lead singer) featured in "Filter Magazine", Reid noted that: '"Some Candy Talking" had nothing to do with drugs, actually. It was just something a radio DJ picked up on, and it was banned in all the major radio stations in the UK.' Though that images of poppy flowers are featured in the video for the single, seeming to imply that the song is indeed about heroin. The song was originally banned for this reason by BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Smith, although it was later voted at no. 9 in that year's John Peel Festive fifty. The song was included in the soundtrack to the 1986 film "Modern Girls".
The EP marked the final release that drummer Bobby Gillespie appeared on. After this release he returned to his own band, Primal Scream.

Carino of Balsamo

Blessed Carino Pietro of Balsamo (died 1293), sometimes called "St. Acerinus", was the murderer of Saint Peter of Verona ("Saint Peter Martyr") who later repented his actions and became a Dominican lay brother. He is venerated as a beatus by the Catholic Church.
Life.
Prior to his entering the Dominican Order, Carino, was, according to Catholic tradition, a cruel man without scruples who had been hired by Milanese Cathars to kill Peter, a prominent Catholic inquisitor. Carino was a native of Cinisello Balsamo. The murder took place on April 6, 1252, when Peter was returning from Como to Milan. Carino's accomplice was named Manfredo Clitoro, of Giussano. The two assassins followed Peter as far as Barlassina, murdering him and mortally wounding Peter's companion Domenico at a lonely spot.
Carino split Peter’s head open, and mortally wounded Domenico. When he found that Peter was still breathing, he stabbed him with a dagger.
Carino fled to a Dominican monastery at Forlì, and confessed his crime to Giacomo Salomoni of Venice, also venerated as a beatus. Carino performed penances and become a lay brother there. Manfredo subsequently fled from the authorities and may have found refuge amongst the Waldenses in the Alps.
Veneration.
After his death, Carino was venerated by the people of Forlì.
The regulation of Carino's cult by the papacy began in 1822, but the death of Pius VII delayed the process, and the paperwork was misplaced. Carino is buried at the Cathedral of Forlì, and in 1934, Cinisello Balsamo obtained Carino's head, a translation at which Blessed Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster participated. Carino's feast day is celebrated on April 28, the day of this translation.

Alicia Sacramone

Alicia Marie Sacramone (; born December 3, 1987) is a retired American artistic gymnast.
Sacramone began gymnastics at the age of eight, started competing in the elite ranks in 2002 and joined the U.S. national team in 2003. At US National Championships from 2004 to 2008, she won twelve medals, including four golds on vault and two golds on floor exercise. At World Championships from 2005 to 2007, she won seven medals, including a floor exercise gold in 2005 and a team gold in 2007. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she won a team silver medal. In 2010, Sacramone made a comeback by winning the National Championship on Vault. Later in 2010 at the World Championships in Rotterdam, Netherlands, she won the World Title on Vault as well. Her gold gave her a total of nine medals overall, joining Shannon Miller and Nastia Liukin as the U.S. athletes with the most medals at the gymnastics world championships until the US team won gold in the team finals at the 2011 World Championships. Though she was injured and could not compete, she still received a medal as an official member of the U.S. team, earning her tenth World medal, making her the most decorated U.S. gymnast in the history of the World Championships.
Sacramone has become noteworthy for supportive leadership of her teammates as well as outspoken remarks in interviews.
Personal life.
Sacramone was born on December 3, 1987 in Boston, Massachusetts to parents Fred, an orthodontist, and Gail Sacramone, a hairstylist and salon owner. She is of Italian descent. Sacramone has an older brother, Jonathan. She graduated from Winchester High School in 2006. She announced her engagement to NFL quarterback Brady Quinn in August 2013.
Early career.
Sacramone began studying dance at the age of five and started training gymnastics three years later, at age eight, in 1996. She began her gymnastics career with Romanian coaches Mihai and Silvia Brestyan at Gymnastics and More club and continued to train with them after they opened their own training facility in Ashland. The Brestyans continue to serve as Sacramone's coaches for the rest of her career.
Senior career.
2003–04.
Her results improved immensely in 2003, when she placed 14th in the all-around and won a bronze medal on the Floor and place 4th on Vault at the 2003 U.S. Nationals, earning a spot on the U.S. National gymnastics team. Sacramone also participated in her first international competition in 2003, the Massilia Cup in France, where she placed fourth on the floor exercise and ninth on vault.
In 2004, Sacramone earned a spot on the US team for the Pacific Alliance Championships in Hawaii. She contributed several scores to help the team to a gold medal finish and won the individual vault title. Sacramone's strong performances caught the attention of the media, who began to consider her a legitimate contender for the American team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
However, at the 2004 U.S. Nationals, an error-filled performance dashed Sacramone's hopes of an Olympic berth. Although she tied with Mohini Bhardwaj for the silver medal on the vault, she finished in 19th place overall and did not qualify to the Olympic Trials. She also suffered an injury to her back and required time off to recover.
Sacramone continued competing in late 2004 as a member of the U.S. national team, and was assigned to several international meets, including the Pan American Individual Event Championships, where she won the vault and floor exercise titles. At the World Cup Finals in Birmingham, England, Sacramone attracted media attention again when she upset reigning Olympic vault champion Monica Roşu to take first place on the event.
2005–2006.
At the 2005 U.S. National Championships, Sacramone won the individual titles on floor and vault, scoring a 9.9 on the latter event, and placed third on the balance beam and fourth in the all-around. She was named to the American team with Nastia Liukin and Chellsie Memmel for the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne, Australia, where she won a gold medal on floor and placed third on the vault. She also defended her World Cup vault title successfully in 2005, winning the event at both the World Cup qualifier in Ghent and the finals in Paris.
Sacramone continued to compete for the U.S. team in 2006, participating in the 2006 World Championships in Aarhus, where she won a silver medal with the American squad and an individual silver on the vault. She defended her vault and floor titles at that year's U.S. Nationals.
In September 2006, Sacramone enrolled in Brown University and joined the school's gymnastics team. During the 2006–2007 season, she juggled a full NCAA competition schedule with her elite training at Brestyan's. She was the first female American gymnast since Kelly Garrison in the late 1980s to combine full-time university studies and NCAA competition with elite gymnastics.
During Sacramone's first year with the Brown Bears, she broke the school's records for the highest scores in the all-around, vault and floor exercise. She was named ECAC Rookie of the Year and swept the Ivy League Classic, becoming the first gymnast to win all five events and posting the highest all-around total ever recorded at the competition. She qualified as an individual on the floor exercise for the NCAA National Championships, the second Brown gymnast ever to do so, but did not advance beyond the preliminary round.
2007.
At the 2007 U.S. National Championships, Sacramone competed on three events, choosing to skip the uneven bars. She defended her title on the vault, placed second on the floor exercise and third on the balance beam. Following Nationals, Sacramone was named to the American team for the World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.
During the qualifying round at the World Championships, Sacramone performed well, qualifying for event finals in floor and vault and contributing to the top qualifying position of the American team. Sacramone also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam event final. However, due to the FIG rule only allowing two athletes per country to participate in each event final, and due to the fact that team mates Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her with higher scores, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal. For the team final, Sacramone competed on vault, beam, and floor, earning 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325 respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a pep talk to refocus them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall which was good enough to secure the gold medal ahead of the Chinese and Romanians.
In event finals, Sacramone received a bronze medal for her vault performance and a silver on floor behind teammate Shawn Johnson. She was visibly upset by her performances, and fought back tears after floor and during the flower and medal
ceremonies.
Both the Brestyans and the U.S. National Team Coordinator, Marta Karolyi, suggested that Sacramone forgo NCAA competition during the 2007–2008 season to concentrate on her preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In September 2007, Sacramone announced that she was "turning pro" and signed with an agent, forfeiting her remaining NCAA eligibility.
2008 pre-Olympics.
In the 2007–2008 academic year, Sacramone continued to work with the Brown Bears gymnastics team as a volunteer assistant coach. She remained a student at Brown, concentrated in sociology, but took the spring 2008 semester off to prepare for the Olympics.
Sacramone competed well at the 2008 U.S. National Championships in Boston and the Olympic Trials in Philadelphia. On July 19, she was named to the 2008 Olympic Team for Beijing.
2008 Summer Olympics.
At the Olympics, Sacramone performed on three events in both the qualifying and team final rounds of competition. In the team final, Sacramone posted a 15.675 score on vault but fell on both floor (14.125) and beam (15.1), incurring 1.70 points in deductions.
In the day following the Olympic team finals, Sacramone was largely blamed for the American team's silver medal placement, and was the subject of negative commentary in media reports. Sacramone herself took responsibility for the results, noting, "It's kinda hard not to blame myself." However, analysts in the gymnastics community, including University of Georgia head coach Suzanne Yoculan, former Olympian John Roethlisberger and "International Gymnast" editor Paul Ziert, noted that the American team started the competition at a difficult point deficit to the Chinese and that mathematically, Sacramone could not have been personally or exclusively responsible for the U.S. team's results. Sacramone also received support from the American team. In one interview, teammate Bridget Sloan stated, "We've all made mistakes. It's just really hard to see her go and leave these Olympics knowing that she thinks it's her fault. It is definitely not and we've all been encouraging her very much."
Individually, Sacramone placed third overall on vault in the preliminary round of competition and qualified to the individual event final on that event. In the vault final, Sacramone placed fourth behind Hong Un Jong, Oksana Chusovitina and Cheng Fei (somewhat controversially, since Cheng fell on her second vault). She also placed fourth overall on beam in preliminaries behind Li Shanshan of China and teammates Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson, but did not advance to the eight-person event finals due to the "two per country" rule.
2008 temporary retirement.
In interviews, Sacramone alluded to retiring after the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She confirmed her retirement in February 2009 during an interview at a Boston Bruins ice hockey game.
2009–2010 return to training and competition.
On August 6, 2009, Sacramone announced her return to training for elite competition. Her return was slowed, however, after having shoulder surgery earlier that year.
On July 24, 2010, Sacramone competed in the CoverGirl Classic. She placed first in both beam and vault, not competing on floor or bars. Her return to competitive form was judged dramatically successful by meet commentators and she was named USA Today's "Athlete of the Week".
Sacramone competed in the U.S. National Championships in August, performing only vault and balance beam. She placed first on vault (her fifth national title on that apparatus) and second on balance beam. She was also named Sportsperson of the Year.
At the World Championships in October, Sacramone won a gold medal on the vault and a silver medal in the team competition. That gave her nine world medals, and tied her with Shannon Miller and Nastia Liukin for the most world medals by an American female gymnast at that time.
2011.
In July 2011, Sacramone added floor exercise to her competitive repertoire at the CoverGirl Classic in Chicago, Illinois. Competing on three events, Sacramone won gold on vault, tied for gold on beam with Jordyn Wieber of Michigan, and won the bronze on floor (13.9).
At August's 2011 Nationals in St. Paul, Minnesota, Sacramone won the balance beam title with a two-night score of 30.1. She placed second to McKayla Maroney on vault (30.6), and she tied with Hallie Mossett for eighth place on floor exercise (27.35).
After participating in two selection camps at the Karolyi Ranch in New Waverly, Texas, Sacramone was named to the 2011 U.S. women's world championships gymnastics team.
While training at the World Championships in Tokyo, Sacramone sustained a tear of her Achilles tendon. She returned to the U.S. immediately for surgery on the tear. However, the U.S. team retained her name on the roster, and she was given a gold medal, in spite have not having competed.
2012.
Sacramone qualified for the 2012 Visa National Championships. She placed first on vault and third on balance beam. At the Olympic Trials, Sacramone placed second on both vault and balance beam, but was not named to the Olympic team. “I leave this sport with no regrets" posted Sacramone on her Twitter feed shortly after the Olympic Team was selected, suggesting that she is likely to retire.
Other activities.
In June 2008, Sacramone and her team mates Shawn Johnson and Nastia Liukin became the first female athletes ever to be signed as CoverGirl spokesmodels. Sacramone is also a member of Team 24 Fitness and serves as a spokeswoman for the fitness company. In 2009, she also appeared in a Gatorade commercial that spoofed "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" as "Alicia, The Girl Who Made Horse Trotting Noises."
During the summer of 2009, Sacramone briefly stayed in Los Angeles, California and she designed for Tank Farm, a men's fashion company. She has discussed her intent to return to college in the media, but announced in August 2009 that she was not intending to return to Brown University. In an interview with "Inside Gymnastics Magazine", she stated, "I plan to continue school I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” she explains. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I think that would be pretty much ideal."
She appeared nude in ESPN's 2011 "Body Issue" and talked about how her body had evolved throughout her elite career and the changes in her self-perception.

Dinosaur egg

Dinosaur eggs are eggs laid by dinosaurs. As reptiles, dinosaurs were presumed to have laid eggs from the 1820s on, when their first scientifically documented remains were being described in England. In 1859, the first scientifically documented dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in France by Jean-Jacques Poech, although they were mistaken for giant bird eggs. The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in 1923 by an American Museum of Natural History crew in Mongolia. Since then many new nesting sites have been found all over the world and a system of classification based on the structure of eggshell was developed in China before gradually diffusing into the West. Dinosaur eggshell can be studied in thin section and viewed under a microscope. The interior of a dinosaur egg can be studied using CAT scans or by gradually dissolving away the shell with acid. Sometimes the egg preserves the remains of the developing embryo inside. The oldest known dinosaur eggs and embryos are from "Massospondylus", which lived during the Early Jurassic, about 190 million years ago.
History.
In 1859, the first scientifically documented dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in southern France by a Catholic priest and amateur naturalist named Father Jean-Jacques Poech; he thought, however, that they were laid by giant birds. The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered serendipitously in 1923 by an American Museum of Natural History crew while looking for evidence of early humans in Mongolia. These eggs were mistakenly attributed to the locally abundant herbivore "Protoceratops", but are now known to be "Oviraptor" eggs. Egg discoveries continued to mount all over the world, leading to the development of multiple competing classification schemes. In 1975 Chinese paleontologist Zhao Zi-Kui started a revolution in fossil egg classification by developing a system of "parataxonomy" based on the traditional Linnaean system which classified eggs based on their physical qualities rather than their hypothesized mothers. Zhao's new method of egg classification was hindered from adoption by Western scientists due to language barriers. However, in the early 1990s Russian paleontologist Konstantin Mikhailov brought attention to Zhao's work in the English language scientific literature.
Identification.
Fossil dinosaur eggshell fragments can be recognized based on three important traits. Their thickness should be roughly uniform, they are usually slightly curved, and their surface is covered in tiny pores. Less frequently, the concave underside of the eggshell fragment will preserve bumps known as mammillae. Sometimes the embryo had absorbed so much of the calcium that the mammilae need a magnifying glass or microscope to be seen. However, there are many kinds of naturally occurring objects which can resemble fossil eggs. These can fool even professional paleontologists.
False eggs.
Calculus: Calculi are egg-like objects formed in the stomachs of ruminants such as cattle, deer, elk, and goats. Calculus formation is a defense mechanism protecting the ruminant's stomach from damage if it swallows a foreign object while grazing. After ingestion, the object is covered by the same material composing bone, calcium phosphate, and eventually vomited out of the animal's system. These "stomach stones" tend to range in size from 1 to 6 centimeters. Larger sizes are known but very rare. Sometimes tiny dimples cover the surface of a stomach stone, which can fool observers into thinking they are the pores of an egg. Fossil egg expert Ken Carpenter has described stomach stones as the most egg-like natural objects, noting that they are "the trickiest [egg-like] objects to correctly identify". Calculi are so egg-like that on one occasion a detailed description of a stomach stone misidentified as a fossil egg was published in the scientific literature. Calculi can be distinguished from real egg fossils because when they are broken open, they show the layers of calcium phosphate and the foreign object at the core. Multiple layers of eggshell are known in pathological eggs, but these layers don't go all the way down to its core the way a stomach stone's do. Calculi are often suspiciously intact, unlike fossil eggs, which are usually damaged. Stomach stones also lack distinct shells with their attending structural components like continuous or prismatic layers, mammillae, and pores.
Concretions: Concretions are formed when decaying organisms change the chemistry of their immediate surroundings in a manner that is conducive to minerals precipitating out of solution. These minerals accumulate in a mass roughly shaped like the region of altered chemistry. Sometimes the is egg-shaped. Most egg-shaped concretions have uniform interiors, however some form through the accumulation of mineral in layers. These layered concretions can be even harder to recognize than those with uniform interiors because the layers can resemble egg white and yolk. The yellow of the false yolk comes from minerals like limonite, siderite, and sulfur.
Concretions also generally lack distinct shells, although sometimes they can appear to have them if their outside surfaces have been case-hardened. Since their interiors are softer, erosion can separate the two, creating eggshell pseudofossils. Real egg fossils should preserve eggshell structures like pores, mammillae, and prismatic or continuous layers, which are not present in concretions. Any given concretion is unlikely to be exactly the same size as any other, so associations of egg-like objects of different sizes are probably not real eggs at all. Concretions can also be far larger than any real egg so an apparently unnaturally large "egg" has probably been misidentified.
Insect trace fossils: Sometimes the living or breeding chambers of an insect burrow are so perfectly egg-shaped that even a paleontologist can mistake a natural cast of these chambers for a fossil egg. Insect burrow fossils can sometimes be distinguished from real egg fossils by the presence of "scratch marks" on their surface left by the insect during the burrow's original excavation. Fossil insect pupae can also resemble eggs. After death and burial, the decomposition of a deceased pupa would leave a gap in the sediment that could be filled with minerals carried by groundwater, forming an egg-like cast. These pseudo-eggs can be recognized by their small size (usually not much longer than a centimeter or two) and lack of an eggshell with its typical anatomy.
Stones: The erosive effects of water can sometimes round rocks into egg-like shapes.
Classification.
The classification of dinosaur eggs is based on the structure of the egg shells viewed in thin section via microscope. There are three main categories of dinosaur eggs: (sauropods and hadrosaurs,) Prismatic, and ornithoid (theropods, including modern birds).
Oogenera.
Oogenera are taxonomic names for types of eggshell. Nearly three dozen oogenera have been named for dinosaur eggs:
Embryos.
Dinosaur embryos, the animal inside the eggs, are very rare but useful to understand ontogeny, heterochrony, and dinosaur systematics.
Embryo fossils are known from:
Taphonomy.
The formation of fossil eggs begins with the original egg itself. Not all eggs that end up fossilizing experience the death of their embryo beforehand. Fossil eggs with open tops are common and could result from the preservation of eggs that hatched successfully. Dinosaur eggs whose embryos died were likely victims of similar causes to those that kill embryos in modern reptile and bird eggs. Typical causes of death include congenital problems, diseases, suffocation from being buried too deep, inimical temperatures, or too much or too little water.
Whether or not hatching was successful, burial would begin with sediments gradually entering any large openings in the shell. Even intact eggs are likely to fill with sediment once they crack under the strain of deep buial. Sometimes, though, fossilization can begin fast enough to prevent the eggs from being cracked. If the water table is high enough dissolved minerals like calcite can percolate through the pores of the eggshell. When the egg is completely filled it can become sturdy enough to withstand the weight of the overlying sediments. Not all fossil egg specimens are of complete specimens, however. Individual pieces of eggshell are much more robust than the entire egg and can be transported intact long distances from where they were originally laid.
When the egg is buried deeply enough, the bacteria decomposing it no longer have access to oxygen and need to power their metabolisms with different substances. These physiological changes in the decomposers also alter the local environment in a way that allows certain minerals to be deposited, while others remain in solution. Generally, however, a fossilizing egg's shell keeps the same calcite it had in life, which allows scientists to study its original structure millions of years after the developing dinosaur hatched or died. However, eggs can also sometimes be altered after burial. This process is called diagenesis. One form of diagenesis is a microscopic cross-hatched pattern imposed on the eggshell by the pressure of being buried deeply. If the pressure gets severe enough, sometimes the eggshell's internal microscopic structure can be completely destroyed. Diagenesis can also happen chemically in addition to physically. The chemical conditions of a decomposing egg can make it easy for silica to be incorporated into eggshell and damage its structure. When iron-bearing substances alter eggshell it can be obvious because compounds like hematite, pyrite, and iron sulfide can turn the shell blackish or rusty colors.
Depositional environments.
Dinosaur eggs are known from a variety of depositional environments.
Beach sands: Beach sands were a good place for dinosaurs to lay their eggs because the sand would be effective at absorbing and holding enough heat to incubate the eggs. One ancient beach deposit in northeastern Spain actually preserves about 300,000 fossil dinosaur eggs.
Floodplains: Dinosaurs often laid their eggs on ancient floodplains. The mudstones deposited at these sites are therefore excellent sources of dinosaur egg fossils.
Sand dunes: Many dinosaur eggs have been recovered from sandstone deposits that formed in the ancient dune fields of what are now northern China and Mongolia. The presence of "Oviraptor" preserved in their life brooding position suggests that the eggs, nests, and parents may have been rapidly buried by sandstorms.
Excavation and preparation.
Usually the first evidence of fossil dinosaur eggs to be discovered are shell fragments that have eroded away from the original eggs and been transported downhill by the elements. If the source eggs can be found the area must be examined for more unexposed eggs. If the paleontologists are fortunate enough to have found a nest, the number and arrangement of the eggs must be estimated. Excavation must proceed to significant depth since many dinosaur nests include multiple layers of eggs. As the underside of the nest is excavated, it would be covered by material like newspaper, tin foil, or tissue. Afterwards, the entire block is covered in multiple layers of plaster-soaked strips of burlap. When the plaster is dried, the block is undercut the rest of the way and turned over.
The fine work of cleaning the egg fossils is performed in a laboratory. Preparation usually begins from the underside of the block, which tends to be the best preserved. Because of their fragility, cleaning fossil eggs requires patience and skill. Scientists use delicate instruments like dental picks, needles, small pneumatic engraving tools, and X-Acto knives. Scientists must determine at what point to stop cleaning based on their own criteria. If eggs are fully extracted they can be more fully studied individually at the cost of information regarding the spatial relationships between eggs or if the eggs had hatched. Commercial fossil dealers tend to expose only the bottom of the eggs since the topsides might be damaged by hatching and therefore less visually appealing to potential customers.
Research techniques.
Acid dissolution.
Acids can be used to learn more about fossil eggs. Diluted acetic acid or EDTA can be used to expose the microstructure of shell that has been damaged by weathering. Acids are also used to extract embryo skeletons from the egg encasing them. Even fossilized soft tissue like muscle and cartilage as well as fat globules from the original egg yolk can be uncovered using this method. Amateur paleontologist Terry Manning has been credited with groundbreaking work developing this technique. First, the paleontologist must submerge the egg in a very dilute phosphoric acid bath. Since the acid solution can penetrate the egg, every few days the specimen must be soaked in distilled water to prevent the acid from damaging the embryo before it is even exposed. If embryonic fossil bone is revealed after drying from the water bath, the exposed fossils must be delicately cleaned with fine instruments like needles and paint brushes. The exposed bone is then coated with plastic preservatives like Acryloid B67, Paraloid B72, or Vinac B15 to protect it from the acid when submerged for another round. The complete process can take months before the whole embryo is revealed. Even then only about 20% of the eggs subjected to the process reveal any embryo fossils at all.
CAT scans.
CAT scans can be used to infer the 3D structure of a fossil egg's interior by compiling images taken of slices through the egg in small regular increments. Scientists have tried to use CAT scans to look for embryo fossils contained inside the egg without having to damage the egg itself by physically extracting them. However, as of Ken Carpenter's 1999 book on dinosaur eggs, "Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs", all alleged embryos discovered using this method were actually false alarms. Variations in the type of infilling mineral or cement binding the infilling sediment into rock sometimes resemble bones in CAT scan images. Sometimes eggshell fragments that fell back into the egg when it hatched have been mistaken for embryonic bones. The use of CAT scans to search for embryonic remains is actually conceptually flawed since embryonic bones have not yet mineralized. Since the infilling sediment is their only source of minerals they will be preserved at basically the same density and therefore have poor visibility in the scan. The validity of this issue has been confirmed by performing Cat scans on fossil eggs known to have embryos inside and noting their poor visibility in the scan images. The only truly reliable way to discover a dinosaur embryo is to cut the egg open or dissolve some of its eggshell away.
Cathodoluminescence.
Cathodoluminescence is the most important tool paleontologists have for revealing whether or not the calcium in fossil eggshell has been altered. Calcite in eggshell is either pure or rich in calcium carbonate. However, the calcite composing the egg can be altered after burial to include significant calcium content. Cathodoluminescence causes calcite altered in this fashion to glow orange.
Gel electrophoresis.
Gel electrophoresis has been used in attempts to identify the amino acids present in the organic components of dinosaur eggshell. Contact with human skin can contaminate eggs with foreign amino acids, so only untouched eggs can be investigated using this technique. EDTA can be used to dissolve the calcite of the eggshell while leaving the shell's organic content intact. The resultant organic residue would be blended and then implanted into gel. Electricity would then be run through the sample, causing the amino acids to migrate through the gel until they stop at levels determined by their physical properties. Protein silver stain is then used to dye the amino acids and make them visible. The bands of amino acids from the dinosaur eggs can then be compared with the banding of samples with known composition for identification.
Gel electrophoresis is not necessarily a perfect means of discovering the amino acid composition of dinosaur eggshell because sometimes the amount or type of amino acids present could be altered during or after preservation. One potential confounding factor would be the heating of deeply buried egg fossils, which can break down amino acids. Another potential source of error is groundwater, which can leach away amino acids. These issues cast doubt as to whether the results these sorts of studies give are reliable as the actual composition of the eggshell's organic material in life. However, studies applying these techniques have made suggestive findings, including amino acid profiles in dinosaur eggs similar to those in modern birds.
Geneva lens measure.
The Geneva Lens Measure is a device used to measure curved surfaces. It is most commonly used by opticians to measure lenses but can also be used by paleontologists to estimate the life size of dinosaur eggs from shell fragments. The instrument can be used to help estimate the size of fossil eggshells by measuring their curved surfaces. Since most eggs aren't perfectly round measurements from multiple parts of the egg with varying shell curvatures may be needed to get a full idea of the egg's size. Ideally an eggshell fragment being used to estimate the full size of an egg should be more than 3 cm long. Smaller eggshell fragments are better suited to other methods of study, like the Obrig radius dial gauge. The Geneva Lens measure gives units in diopters which must be converted to the radius in millimeters. Use of the Geneva Lens Measure to estimate the size of a fossil egg was first done by Sauer on fossil ostrich eggs.
Light microscopy.
Light microscopy can be used to magnify the structure of dinosaur eggshell for scientific research. To do so an eggshell fragment must be embedded in epoxy resin and sliced into a thin section with a thin-bladed rock saw. This basic method was invented by French paleontologist Paul Gervais and has remained almost unchanged ever since. Horizontally cut thin sections are called tangential thin sections while vertically cut thin sections are called radial sections. Regardless of direction, the sample must be abraded by fine-grit sand or emory paper until it is translucent. Then the structure of the shell's calcite crystals or pores can be examined under a petrographic microscope. The calcite crystal structure of dinosaur eggshell can be classified by their effect on polarized light. Calcite is capable of acting as a polarizing light filter. When a microscopic thin section sample is rotated relative to polarized light it can eventually block all the light and seem opaque. This phenomenon is called extinction. Different varieties of dinosaur eggs with their different calcite crystal structures have different light extinction properties that can be used to identify and distinguish even eggs that seem very similar on the surface. To reconstruct the three-dimensional structures of the shell's pore channels scientists require a series of multiple radial sections.
Scanning electron microscopy.
Scanning electron microscopy is used to view dinosaur eggshell under even greater magnification than is possible with light microscopy. However, this does not mean that scanning electron microscopy is necessarily the superior research method. Since both techniques provide differing amounts and types of information they can be used together synergistically to provide a more complete understanding of the specimen under scrutiny. Eggshell specimens best suited for scanning electron microscopy are those recently broken because such a break will usually occur along the plane of the eggshell's calcite crystal lattice. First, a small specimen would be covered with a very thing layer of gold or platinum. The specimen would then be bombarded with electrons. The electrons bounce back off the metal and due to their small size, can be used to form a detailed image of the specimen.
Mass spectometry.
Mass spectrometry is a method for determining eggshell composition that uses a device called a mass spectrometer. First, the eggshell sample must be powdered and placed in the mass spectrometer's vacuum chamber. The powder is vaporized by the heat of an intense laser beam. A stream of electrons then bombard the gaseous eggshell molecules, which breaks down the molecules in the eggshell and imbues them with a positive charge. A magnetic field then sorts them by mass before they are detected by the spectrometer. One application of mass spectrometry has been to study the isotope ratios of dinosaur eggshell in order to ascertain their diets and living conditions. However this research is complicated by the fact that isotope ratios can be altered post mortem before or during fossilization. Bacterial decomposition can alter carbon isotope ratios in eggs and groundwater can alter the oxygen isotope ratios of eggshell.
X rays.
X-ray equipment, like CAT scans, are used to study the interior of fossil eggs. Unlike CAT scans, x-ray imaging condenses the entire interior of the egg into a single two-dimensional image rather than a series of images documenting the interior in three dimensions. X-ray imaging in the context of dinosaur research has generally been used to look for evidence of embryonic fossils contained inside the egg. However, as of Kenneth Carpenter's 1999 book "Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs", all putative embryos discovered using x-rays have been misidentifications. This is because the use of x-rays to find embryos is conceptually flawed. Embryo bones are incompletely developed and will generally lack their own mineral content, as such the only source of minerals for these bones is the sediment that fills the egg after burial. The fossilized bones will therefore have the same density as the sediment filling the interior of the egg which served as the source for their mineral content and will be poorly visible in an x-ray image. So far the only reliable method for examining embryonic fossils preserved in dinosaur eggs is to physically extract them through means such as acid dissolution.
X-rays can be used to chemically analyze dinosaur eggshell. This technique requires pure shell samples, so the fossil must be completely free of its surrounding rock matrix. The shell must then be further cleaned by anultrasonic bath. The sample can then be bombarded by electrons emitted by the same sort of probe used by scanning electron microscopes. Upon impact with the samples x-rays are emitted that can be used to identify the composition of the shell. 
X-ray diffraction is a method for determining eggshell composition that uses X-rays to directly bombard powdered eggshell. Upon impact some of the x-rays will be diffracted at different angles and intensities depending on the specific elements present in the eggshell.

On Vision and Colors

On Vision and Colors () is a treatise by Arthur Schopenhauer that was published in May 1816 when the author was 28 years old. Schopenhauer had extensively discussed with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about the poet's "Theory of Colours" of 1810, in the months around the turn of the years 1813 and 1814, and basically shared Goethe's views.
Schopenhauer tried to physiologically demonstrate that color is "specially modified activity of the retina." The initial basis for Schopenhauer's color theory comes from Goethe's chapter on physiological colors, which discusses three principal pairs of contrasting colors: red/green, orange/blue, and yellow/violet. This is in contrast to the customary emphasis on Newton's seven colors of the Newtonian spectrum. In accordance with Aristotle, Schopenhauer considered that colors arise by the mixture of shadowy, cloudy darkness with light. With white and black at each extreme of the scale, colors are arranged in a series according to the mathematical ratio between the proportions of light and darkness. Schopenhauer agreed with Goethe's claim that the eye tends toward a sum total that consists of a color plus its spectrum or afterimage. Schopenhauer arranged the colors so that the sum of any color and its complementary afterimage always equals unity. The complete activity of the retina produces white. When the activity of the retina is divided, the part of the retinal activity that is inactive and not stimulated into color can be seen as the ghostly complementary afterimage, which he and Goethe call a (physiological) spectrum.
History.
At his mother's tea parties in Weimar, Schopenhauer had met Goethe in 1813. In November, Goethe congratulated Schopenhauer on his doctoral dissertation "On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason". Both men shared the opinion that visual representations yielded more knowledge than did concepts. In the winter of 1813/1814, Goethe personally demonstrated his color experiments to Schopenhauer and they discussed color theory. Goethe encouraged Schopenhauer to write "On Vision and Colors". Schopenhauer wrote it in a few weeks while living in Dresden in 1815. After it was published, in July 1815, Goethe rejected several of Schopenhauer's conclusions, especially as to whether white is a mixture of colors. He was also disappointed that Schopenhauer considered the whole topic of color to be a minor issue. Schopenhauer wrote as though Goethe had merely gathered data while Schopenhauer provided the actual theory. A major difference between the two men was that Goethe considered color to be an objective property of light and darkness. Schopenhauer's Kantian transcendental idealism was opposed to Goethe's realism. For Schopenhauer, color was subjective in that it exists totally in the spectator's retina. As such, it can be excited in various ways by external stimuli or internal bodily conditions. Light is only one kind of color stimulus.
In 1830, Schopenhauer published a revision of his color theory. The title was "Theoria colorum Physiologica, eademque primaria" ("Fundamental physiological theory of color"). It appeared in Justus Radius's "Scriptores ophthalmologici minores" ("Minor ophthalmological writings"). "This is no mere translation of the first edition," he wrote, "but differs noticeably from it in form and presentation and is also amply enriched in subject matter." Because it was written in Latin, he believed that foreign readers would be able to appreciate its value.
An improved second edition of "On Vision and Colors" was published in 1854. In 1870, a third edition was published, edited by Julius Frauenstädt. In 1942, an English translation by Lt. Col. E. F. J. Payne was published in Karachi, India. This translation was republished in 1994 by Berg Publishers, Inc., edited by Professor David E. Cartwright.
Content.
Preface to the second edition (the first addition had no Preface).
Although this work is mainly concerned with physiology, it is of philosophical value. In gaining knowledge of the subjective nature of color, the reader will have a more profound understanding of Kant's doctrine of the "a priori", subjective, intellectual forms of all knowledge. This is in opposition to contemporary realism which simply takes objective experience as positively given. Realism doesn't consider that it is through the subjective that the objective exists. The observer's brain stands like a wall between the observing subject and the real nature of things.
Introduction.
Goethe performed two services: (1) he freed color theory from its reliance on Newton, and (2) he provided a systematic presentation of data for a theory of color.
Before discussing color, there are some preliminary remarks to be made regarding vision. In § 1, it is shown that the perception of externally perceived objects in space is a product of the intellect's understanding after it has been stimulated by sensation from the sense organs. These remarks are necessary in order for the reader to be convinced that colors are entirely in the eye alone and are thoroughly subjective
Chapter 1—On Vision.
§ 1.
Intuitive perception, or knowledge of an object, is intellectual, not merely sensual. The intellect's understanding regards every sense impression in the observer's body as coming from an external cause. This transition from effect to cause is knowledge of the pure understanding, not a rational conclusion or combination of concepts and judgments according to logical laws. Knowledge of an object never results from mere impression, but always from the application of the law of causality, and consequently of the understanding. The law of causality is the sole form of the understanding and the precondition of the possibility of any objective perception.
Illusion occurs when the understanding is given uncommon sensations. If the sensations become commonplace, the illusion may disappear.
Intellectual understanding, or knowing the objective cause of a subjective sensation, distinguishes animals from plants. All animals are able to intuitively perceive objects.
Color is usually attributed to external bodies. However, color is actually the activity of the eye's retina. It is a sensation. The external body is perceived as the cause of the sensation of color. We say, "The body is red." In reality, though, color exists only in the retina of the eye. It is separate from the external object. Color is a mere sensation in the sense organ. The external object is perceived by the intellect's understanding as being the cause of sensations.
Chapter 2—On Colors.
§ 2.
Newton, Goethe, and all other color theorists began by investigating light and colored bodies in order to find the cause of color. They should have started with an investigation of the effect, the given phenomenon, the changes in the eye., we can afterward investigate the external physical and chemical causes of those sensations.
The eye's reaction to external stimulus is an activity, not a passive response. It is the activity of the retina. When the eye's retina receives a full impression of light, or when whiteness appears, it is fully active. When light is absent, or when blackness appears, the retina is inactive.
§ 3.
There are gradations to the intensity or strength of the retina's activity, or reaction to external stimulus. The undivided activity of the retina is divided into stronger or weaker degrees when stimulated by pure light or whiteness. When influenced by light, the degrees are: Light — Half Shade — Darkness. When influenced by whiteness, the degrees are: White — Gray — Black. In this way, grays are seen. The intensity or energy of the retina's activity increases as more light or whiteness stimulates the eye. These gradations are made possible by the quantitative intensive divisibility of the retina's activity.
§ 4.
The activity of the retina also has a quantitative extensive divisibility. The whole extent of the retina is divided into countless small juxtaposed spots or points. Each point is individually stimulated by light or whiteness and reacts separately. The eye can receive many impressions at one time, and therefore side by side.
§ 5.
The qualitative division of the activity is completely different from the two quantitative divisions. It occurs when color is presented to the eye. Schopenhauer described the way in which various points or places on the retina become fatigued from being overstimulated. After staring at a black figure on a white background, the overactive and excited retinal points become exhausted and do not react to stimulation when the eye finally looks away. A ghostly appearance of a black background is seen with a light-colored figure. The retinal positions that were exhausted by the whiteness become completely inactive. The retinal positions that had been rested are now easily stimulated. This explains afterimage (physiological spectra). Both Goethe and Schopenhauer use the word "spectrum" , from the Latin word "spectrum" meaning "appearance" or "apparition," to designate an afterimage.
If, instead of white, we stare at yellow, then the afterimage, or physiological color spectrum, is violet. Yellow, unlike white, does not fully stimulate and exhaust the retina's activity. Yellow partially stimulates points on the retina and leaves those points partially unstimulated. The retina's activity has been qualitatively divided and separated into two parts. The unstimulated part results in a violet afterimage. Yellow and violet are the complement of each other because together they add up to full retinal activity. Yellow is closer to white, so it activates the retina more than violet, which is closer to black.
An orange color is not as close to white. It doesn't activate the retina as much as yellow. Orange's complement is blue, which is that much closer to white than was violet. A red color is halfway between white and black. Red's complement is green which is also halfway between white and black. With red and green, the retina's qualitatively divided activity consists of two equal halves.
Red and green are two completely equal qualitative halves of the retina's activity. Orange is 2/3 of this activity, and its complement, blue, is only 1/3. Yellow is ¾ of the full activity, and its complement, violet, is only ¼.
The range of all colors contains a continuous series of innumerable shades that blend into each other. Why are red, green, orange, blue, yellow, and violet given names and considered to be the most important? Because they represent the retina's activity in the simplest fractions or ratios. The same is true of the seven keynotes in the musical diatonic scale: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. Color is the qualitatively divided activity of the retina. The retina has a natural tendency to display its activity entirely. After the retina has been partly stimulated, its remaining complement is active as the physiological spectrum or afterimage. In this way, the retina is fully and wholly active.
Knowledge of these six colors is inborn in the mind. They are ideal and are never found pure in nature, in the same way that regular geometrical figures are innate. We have them "a priori" in our minds as standards to which we compare actual colors. These three pairs of colors are pure, subjective Epicurean anticipations because they are expressed in simple, rational, arithmetical ratios similar to the seven tones of the musical scale and their rational vibration numbers.
Black and white are not colors because they are not fractions and represent no qualitative division of the retina's activity. Colors appear in pairs as the union of a color and its complement. Newton's division into seven colors is absurd because the sum of all basic colors cannot be an odd number.
§ 6.
The qualitatively divided activity of the retina is a polarity, like electricity and magnetism. The retina's polarity is successive, in time, whereas the polarity of the others is simultaneous, in space. The retina's activity, like Yin and Yang, is split into two parts which condition each other and seek to reunite. Red, orange, and yellow could be conventionally designated by a plus sign. Green, blue, and violet could be the negative poles.
§ 7.
According to Goethe, color is like shade or gray in that it is darker than white and brighter than black. The difference between grays and colors, though, is as follows. Light is activity of the retina. Darkness is retinal inactivity. Grays appear when the intensity or strength of the retina's activity is lessened. Colors appear when the whole activity of the retina is divided into partial complementary poles according to ratios. With the merely quantitative, intensive division of the retina's activity, there is only a gradual (by degrees) diminution of the intensity or strength of the retina's full activity. No fractional division of activity in ratios occurs. This lessening of strength by small degrees results in gray shades. However, with the qualitative fractional division of the activity of the retina, the activity of the part that appears as color is necessarily conditioned by the inactivity of the complementary fractional part. The polar contrast between the active and inactive parts results in color. The vivid partial activity of the stimulated retinal spot is supported by that same spot's partial inactivity. Every color's darkness appears as its afterimage, or spectrum. Conversely, when looking at an afterimage, or physiological spectrum, the previously existing color is the darkening factor.
§ 8.
Newton recognized that color is darker than white or light. He erroneously investigated light instead of the eye, the objective instead of the subjective. In so doing, he asserted that light rays are composed of seven colored rays. These seven were like the seven intervals of the musical scale. Schopenhauer claimed that there are only four prismatic colors: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. The rays described by Newton are supposed to be variously colored according to laws that have nothing to do with the eye. Instead of Newton's division of sunshine into seven rays, Schopenhauer claimed that color was a division of the eye's retina into two complementary parts. Like the Delphic Oracle, Copernicus, and Kant, Schopenhauer concentrated on the subjective rather than the objective, on the observer's experience rather than the observed object. In general, he believed, the subjective viewpoint leads to correct results.
Colors are not in light. Colors are nothing more than the eye's activity, appearing in polar contrasts. Philosophers have always surmised that color belongs to the eye rather than to things. Locke, for example, claimed that color was at the head of his list of secondary qualities.
Newton's theory has color as an occult quality. Schopenhauer's theory claims to be more explanatory. He said that each color is a definite + or − side of the division of the retina's activity, expressed as a fraction that reflects the color's sensation.
§ 9.
When the entire activity of the eye is completely qualitatively partitioned, the color and its spectrum (afterimage) appear with maximum energy as being vivid, bright, dazzling, and brilliant. If the division is not total, however, part of the retina can remain undivided. A union of the quantitative intensive division with the qualitative division of the retina occurs. If the remainder is active, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they fade into white. If the remainder is inactive, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they darken into black. If the remainder is only partially inactive, then the color loses its energy by mixing with gray.
§ 10.
If the activity of the retina is divided without a remainder, or if the remainder is active, then a color and its spectrum (afterimage) are bright or pale. When such a color and its spectrum are united, then the eye sees pure light or white. For example, the mixture of bright or pale red and green on the same retinal spot results in the impression there of light or white. White cannot be produced by mixing colored pigments. With colors from a prism, however, the production of white can be demonstrated by using a mixture of colored light from each of the three main pairs of complementary colors: red – green, orange – blue, or yellow – violet. White can be produced from two complementary opposite colors when both of the external causes of the colors excite the same retinal place at the same time. Newton claimed that white could be produced by the aggregation of his seven prismatic colors. He erroneously considered color to be in light instead of in the eye. White is the result of the combination of two opposite colors because their inactivity, or darkness, is removed when the two active parts of the retina combine.
According to Newton, refracted light must appear colored. With the achromatic refractor, however, this is not the case. Newtonians explain this by saying that the achromatic refractor's crown glass and flint glass refract light as a whole with equal intensity but disperse individual colors differently. According to Schopenhauer, achromatism results when refraction occurs in one direction in the concave lens and in another direction in the convex lens. A blue band then overlaps an orange band while a violet edge covers the yellow. The qualitatively divided retina (color) is thus reunited in full activity, resulting in achromatism (the absence of color).
If an observer looks through a prism at a white disk on a black background, two subsidiary images are seen. This is due to double refraction as the light bends twice, when entering and leaving the prism. With this double refraction, the two subsidiary images appear as one above and one below the main image. The distance of the two subsidiary images from the main image corresponds to the Newtonians' dispersion. The wideness or narrowness of the colored bands are, however, nonessential properties that differ according to the type of light-refracting substance that is used. The top of the upper image is violet. Below the violet is blue. The bottom of the lower image is orange. Above the orange is yellow. In this way, along with the white disk and the black background, four prismatic colors appear: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. This is in disagreement with Newton's claim that there are seven prismatic colors. As the upper image overlaps black, it is seen as violet. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as blue. As the lower image overlaps black, it is seen as orange. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as yellow. This shows how colors are produced when the image mixes with either lightness or darkness, in accordance with Goethe's assertions.
§ 11.
In the operation of a healthy eye, three kinds of division of retinal activity often occur at once. (1) The quantitative intensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in a loss of color energy and a deviation toward paleness or darkness; (2) After being excited by an external stimulant, the quantitative extensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in the retina being covered by many various juxtaposed spots of color sensation; (3) When the stimulation ceases, an afterimage (physiological spectrum) appears on each retinal spot.
§ 12.
Afterimages (spectra) appear after a mechanical shock to the eye. The eye's activity is convulsively divided. Transitory pathological spectra appear from glare or dazzle. The retina's activity is disorganized from over-stimulation. A dazzled eye sees red when looking at brightness and green when looking into darkness. The retina's activity is forcefully divided by the powerful stimulation. When the eye strains to see in dim light, the retina is voluntarily activated and intensively divided. Blue eyeglasses counter the effect of orange candlelight and produce the effect of daylight. An additional proof of the subjective nature of color, namely that it is a function of the eye itself and is only secondarily related to external objects, is given by the daguerreotype. It objectively shows that color is not essential to the appearance of an object. Also, people who are color blind would see color if it was in the object and not in the eye.
§ 13.
Colors and the laws by which they appear reside within the eye. The external cause of color is a stimulus which excites the retina and separates its polarity. Goethe had organized color into three classes: physiological, physical, and chemical. He proposed that the external causes of color are physical colors and chemical colors.
Physical colors.
Physical colors are temporary. They exist when light combines with cloudy transparent or translucent media, such as smoke, fog, or a glass prism. They are comprehensible because we know that they result from part of the qualitative division of retinal activity. Light is the external physical stimulus of the retina's activity. The more that we know about the effect (color as physiological fact), the more we can know "a priori" about its external cause. (1) The external stimulus can only excite color, which is the retina's polar division. (2) There are no individual colors. Colors come in pairs because each color is the qualitative part of the retina's full activity. The remaining part is the color's complementary color. (3) There are an infinite number of colors. Three pairs are distinguished by names of their own, however, because the retina's activity is bipartitioned in a rational proportion that consists of simple numbers. (4) A color's external cause, acting as a stimulus, must be capable of being changed and infinitely modified as much as the retina's activity can be infinitely divided qualitatively. (5) In the eye, color is a cloudy shade of white. This shadiness is the retina's resting part while the other retinal part is active. Newton's theory asserts that each prismatic color is 1/7 of the whole of light. If an infinite number, instead of seven, of light rays is assumed, then each color would be an infinitely small fraction of the whole of light. Schopenhauer's theory, however, claims that yellow is ¾ as bright as white. Orange is 2/3, red is ½, green is ½, blue is 1/3, and violet is ¼ as bright as white. The external cause of color is a diminished light that imparts just as much light to the color as it imparts darkness to the color's complement. Unlike Goethe, for Schopenhauer the primary phenomenon, or limit of explanation, is not an external cause, but the "organic capacity of the retina to let its nervous activity appear in two qualitatively opposite halves, sometimes equal, sometimes unequal..."
Chemical colors.
Chemical colors are more durable properties of an external object, such as the red color of an apple. A chemical color is incomprehensible because we don't know its cause. Its appearance is only known from experience and it is not an essential part of the object. Chemical colors result from changes in an object's surface. A slight change in the surface may result in a different color. Color, therefore, is not an essential property of an object. This confirms the subjective nature of color.
§ 14.
Schopenhauer said that he didn't have to worry about his discoveries being attributed to previous thinkers. "For, prior to 1816, never at any time did it occur to anyone to regard color ... as the halved activity of the retina, and accordingly to assign to each individual color its "definite numerical fraction" — a fraction that, with another color, goes to make up unity, this unity representing white or the full activity of the retina." Schopenhauer criticized scientists for thinking that color exists in external objects, instead of in the spectator's eye. Color as vibrations of an ether was rejected by him. Fraunhofer lines, according to Schopenhauer, do not exist in light itself. They result from the edges of the slit that light passes through.
Letter to Eastlake.
In 1841, Schopenhauer wrote a letter in English to Charles Lock Eastlake whose English translation of Goethe's book on colors had recently been reviewed in several journals. Schopenhauer included a copy of his "On Vision and Colors" with the letter. He briefly communicated the main point of his book as follows:
...if, bearing in mind the numerical fractions, (of the activity of the Retina) by which I express the 6 chief colours, You contemplate these colours singly, then You will find that only by this, and by no other theory on earth, You will come to understand the peculiar sensation, which every colour produces in your eye, and thereby get an insight into the very essence of every colour, and of colour in general. Likewise my theory alone gives the true sense in which the notion of complementary colours is to be taken, viz: as having no reference to light, but to the Retina, and not being a redintegration of white light, but of the full action of the Retina, which by every colour undergoes a bipartition either in yellow (3/4) and violet (1/4) or in orange (2/3) and blue (1/3) or in red (1/2) and green (1/2). This is in short the great mystery.
Here he explained that color results from the way that the retina reacts to sensation. The cause may be light or other pressure on the retina. The fractions of two complementary colors sum to unity. White is undivided, whole retinal activity.
Influence.
Ludwig Wittgenstein and Erwin Schrödinger were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's works and both seriously investigated color theory. Johannes Itten based his work on Schopenhauer's theory of color.
Scientific value.
According to Rudolf Arnheim, Schopenhauer’s "…basic conception of complementary pairs in retinal functioning strikingly anticipates the color theory of Ewald Hering." Nietzsche noted that the Bohemian physiologist, Professor Czermak, acknowledged Schopenhauer’s relation to the Young-Helmholtz theory of color. Bosanquet claimed that Schopenhauer’s color theory was in accord with scientific research.

Sheila Graber

Sheila Graber (born 1940) is a British animator and Visiting Professor to the University of Sunderland. She animated the children's television series "Paddington", has taught in schools and universities, and has won numerous awards.
Early life.
Graber was born in 1940, and raised in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. She began her career as a teacher in Birmingham after earning a National Diploma in Fine Art from the Sunderland Art College (now part of the University of Sunderland) in 1959.
After twenty years of teaching, Graber first began to make animated films in 1970, initially using the medium to teach her students another form of art, following on from painting, clay modelling, woodwork and metalwork.
Animation.
Between 1975 and 1980, Graber created a selection of animated shorts which were shown worldwide. One animation, "Mondrian", about the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian was screened at the Tate Gallery, Mondrian’s own house in the Netherlands, the Open University and British Broadcasting Corporation's children's television series "Blue Peter".
By 1975, Graber was working for Filmfair, and created the animation for Paddington Bear and Mr and Mrs Brown for the television series "Paddington". She also animated the 1983 BBC series "Just So Stories", adapted from a collection of children's stories of the same name, written by Rudyard Kipling.
In 1980, newly divorced, Sheila left her role as head of Creative Studies at a large comprehensive school to begin teaching animation classes in Tunisia and Caracas, and pursue a career as a full-time professional artist and animator.
Many of Graber's films are held in the archive of the Institute of Amateur Cinematographers film and video institute [http://www.theiac.org.uk], including a number she made as the introduction for events and conferences hosted by that organisation.
Later life.
In 2001, Sheila took a position at the University of Teesside, as the Animator in Residence. Commenting on her appointment, she said, "I’m hoping to work ... on making a film and explore the potential of computer animation." After creating over 60 shorts and three series for World TV, she teamed up with fellow director Jen Miller in 1996 to form the company Graber Miller. In 2004 she moved to the Republic of Ireland to open a studio to provide guidance and inspiration to a new generation of animators, before taking up a position at the University of Sunderland later that same year. Speaking of her role as Senior Research and Teaching Fellow in Animation, Graber said, "it's great to work with older students. It's a real two-way process and I hope I inspire them as much as they inspire me." As of 2008, Graber continues to work at the university.
Awards and recognition.
Graber was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Sunderland in 1998 for "Outstanding services to Education and Art".
In 2003, Graber won an award in the "Best Digital Image Designer Category" at the North East and Border regional award ceremony of the Royal Television Society, and had another production nominated for "The Wow Factor" – two minutes of video which could produce a collective "Wow" from the judges. In 2004, one of her works was a finalist in the "Best Non-Broadcast Factual Production Category". and was awarded the annual Lifetime Achievement Award,

Per Inge Torkelsen

Per Inge Torkelsen (born 21 March 1953) is a Norwegian comic, author, radio personality, and self declared clown. He is known for the Norwegian expression "Gi ungdommen en flaske brennevin før idretten tar dem" (). In 2007 he was elected into the city council in Stavanger for the Liberal Party of Norway. Between 2003 and 2007 he was the leader of the Eiganes og Våland borough council. He is listed as a clown in the telephone book.
Born in Stavanger, Torkelsen is a trained teacher of English, but is most well known as a comedian. He has worked as a postman, scrap dealer, illusionist, and was the Norwegian champion of magic. He has held talks for companies and has been involved in debates. He has also been the program leader on children's television in Norway and for a period played a permanent role in the long-running NRK program "Norge Rundt". Starting in 1980, he was a member of the municipality council in his home city of Stavanger. Today he is the leader of the Eiganes og Våland city district council for the Liberal Party of Norway.
He was only 15 years old when he was first noticed in the national media. He fooled all of Norway's archaeologists by placing five Chinese coins from the 10th century in an excavation field in Stavanger. In the end of the 1960s, Stavanger prison and some other buildings in the market area of Stavanger were torn down, and at the same time archaeologists were excavating. Stavanger museum sent out press releases about the find, and soon the discovery was known around the world. But after some time, Torkelsen contacted regional newspaper "Stavanger Aftenblad" in order to tell the truth about the coins. Oddmund Møllerop, the director of the Stavanger archaeological museum at the time, has said that Torkelsen had planted the coins in the perfect spot. The coins happened to be planted in a location where the age of the land that the archaeologists were excavating was precisely the same age as the coins. Had the coins been placed anywhere else in the excavation site, the archaeologists would have been able to tell that they were planted there.
Torkelsen is also known as a talented spokesperson for smokers and he has many times played around with this theme. He is also known for collecting comic books and owns one of Norway's biggest collections with over 28,000 books. Most of them are displayed in the children's museum in Stavanger. In addition, he is known for the release of the books "Den store stygge idrettsboka" (), "Den store norske begravelsesboka" (), "Ikkje heilt rektige" (), and the controversial "Den store, stygge eldreboka" (). In addition to all this, he has had success with the variety show group "Løgnaslaget" (together with Dag Schreiner and Steinar Lyse). The group has also released music.
Torkelsen was one of the founders of "Den Store Norske Humorfestivalen" ().
Since 2003, he has been a permanent weekly radio columnist for the radio program "Norgesglasset" on NRK radio.
Controversies.
In 2000 there was much debate and resentment from the public when Torkelsen released the book "Den store stygge eldreboka", which he initially wanted to call "Drep de eldre" (). The book contains a bunch of negative characteristics of the elderly. Because of this he has received death threats and been attacked on the street. In the same year, he reported regional newspaper "Rogalands Avis" to the police because of someone who wrote in to the newspaper urging pensionists to shoot Torkelsen. When the report was dismissed, he filed a complaint against the newspaper, but the paper was found not to be at fault. In the book, Torkelsen wrote, among other things, that pensioners that have too much money should pay for themselves, so that other pensioners without any income, single mothers and families just starting out would have it better. Torkelsen says that there would be no requirement for them to do this, however. He has said that he expected to cause a stir after his confrontation with the conservatives among the elderly, but didn't expect death threats or physical attacks.
There was also controversy when he released one of his older books, "Den store norske begravelsesboka" in 1996. Earlier, in 1992, he released "Den store stygge idrettsboka", where he attacked sports. After publishing the book, he was sued by the javelin thrower Trine Hattestad because she thought that he had defamed her. The case was settled in court and Torkelsen said he was willing to pay 100,000 NOK in damages.
Other engagements.
In 2006, he was the master of ceremonies for the theatre festival in Sandnes where there were 13 different theatres. From the fall of 2006 until the spring of 2008 he was a director for Teaterverkstedet Ganddal in cooperation with Rogaland amateur theatre.
As a director for the theater company Teaterverkstedet Ganddal, he has directed two pieces:
These two performances were a huge success for both Torkelsen and Teaterverkstedet Ganddal.

The 2008 Rallye Deutschland was the tenth round of the 2008 World Rally Championship season. The event ran from August 15 to August 17 and was won by Sébastien Loeb for the seventh consecutive year. 
The rally marked the first time a driver had won a WRC event seven times in a row, and the second time a driver had won the same event seven times during his career, after Marcus Grönholm's seven wins in the Rally Finland. Loeb's teammate Dani Sordo took second place, eventually starting a series of three double wins for the Citroën Total World Rally Team.
Stobart M-Sport Ford driver François Duval beat factory Ford driver Mikko Hirvonen to the last podium place. Subaru's Petter Solberg and Chris Atkinson took the following positions, and Henning Solberg edged out Urmo Aava to take two points for seventh place. In the Junior World Rally Championship, Sébastien Ogier closed in on the title with his third win of the season.
Gigi Galli retired after crashing heavily on the fifth stage and fracturing his left femur. The recovery was expected to take five months, and he missed the five last rallies of the season.

Carl August Heinrich Ferdinand Oesterley

Carl August Heinrich Ferdinand Oesterley (January 23, 1839 – December 16, 1930) was a German landscape painter who eventually specialized in scenes from Norway.
Biography.
He was a native of Göttingen, the son of painter Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Oesterley. He attended classes at the "Polytechnikum" in Hannover, where he studied under his father. Beginning 1857, he attended the "Kunstakademie" (Art Academy) in Düsseldorf, where he studied painting under Ernst Deger and Eduard Bendemann.
During a visit to Lübeck in 1865, where he copied Hans Memling's "Passion", he made some attempts at architectural and landscape painting. These turned out so well that from then on he dedicated himself to landscape painting. Beginning in 1870 he focused his artistic efforts mainly on Norwegian landscapes, for which he devoted several study trips. He lived in Hamburg and received a first-class medal from the "Münchener Ausstellung" (Munich Exhibition). He died in Altona-Blankenese, now Hamburg.

Frank Whitten

Frank Edgar Richard Whitten (15 November 1942 – 12 February 2011) was a New Zealand television actor. He was more recently known for playing Ted "Grandpa" West in the New Zealand television show "Outrageous Fortune".
Life and career.
Frank Whitten was born in Te Aroha and grew up in the Waikato Region in the 1940s and 50s. Around 1963, "with very little experience and even less money", he left for England to become an actor. He also spent time as an improvisational tutor at leading British drama school the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and by 1970 was the school's vice-principal. Over the next eighteen years, Whitten worked in a children's community theatre company he co-founded called Common Stock, which developed plays with, and for, working-class children.
In 1982 Whitten returned to New Zealand and began acting in theatre. Two years later, he appeared as an exploitative guru of a commune in "Trespasses", the movie spin off of police show "Mortimer's Patch". The same year, Whitten played the enigmatic farmer who strides into the isolated rural world of a young child in "Vigil", the first feature directed by Vincent Ward. In the mid-1980s he joined the serial "Heroes", playing roadie to a group of young musicians. He followed this role by playing one of the main roles on historical drama "Heart of the High Country", based on the novel by English author Elizabeth Gowans.
Whitten had a role in the short film "Accidents", and small roles in the romance "Arriving Tuesday", "Zilch", "The Returning", and two international thrillers, "Chill Factor" and "Hot Target". In 2003, he appeared in P.J. Hogan's live action remake of "Peter Pan".
Television.
On television, he made guest appearances on "Erebus: The Aftermath", "Gloss", "The Chosen", "Ray Bradbury Theatre" and "Mysterious Island", and a lead role in the award-winning miniseries "The Leaving of Liverpool".
In 2007, his ongoing role on as "Grandpa" Ted West on "Outrageous Fortune" won him a best supporting actor award at the New Zealand Screen Awards.
For twelve years, he played the older man in the Speight's "Southern Man" series of television commercials, well known for his character's catchphrase, "Good on ya, mate!"
"Trifecta".
Frank Whitten penned the stage drama "Trifecta".

British people

British people, also referred to as Britons or archaically as Britishers, are nationals or natives of the United Kingdom, British Overseas Territories, Crown Dependencies; and their descendants. British nationality law governs modern British citizenship and nationality, which can be acquired, for instance, by descent from British nationals. When used in a historical context, British people refers to the ancient Britons, the indigenous inhabitants of Great Britain south of the Forth.
Although early assertions of being British date from the Late Middle Ages, the creation of the united Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity. The notion of Britishness was forged during the Napoleonic Wars between Britain and the First French Empire, and developed further during the Victorian era. The complex history of the formation of the United Kingdom created a "particular sense of nationhood and belonging" in Great Britain; Britishness became "superimposed on much older identities", of English, Scots and Welsh cultures, whose distinctiveness still resist notions of a homogenised British identity. Because of longstanding ethno-sectarian divisions, British identity in Northern Ireland is controversial, but it is held with strong conviction by unionists.
British people are descended mainly from the varied ethnic stocks that settled in Great Britain before the eleventh century. Prehistoric, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse influences were blended in Britain under the Normans, descended from Scandinavian settlers in northern France. Conquest and union facilitated migration, cultural and linguistic exchange, and intermarriage between the peoples of England, Scotland and Wales during the Middle Ages, Early Modern period and beyond. Since 1922, there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people from what is now the Republic of Ireland, the Commonwealth, mainland Europe and elsewhere; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens with some assuming a British, dual or hyphenated identity.
The British are a diverse, multi-national and multicultural society, with "strong regional accents, expressions and identities". The social structure of the United Kingdom has changed radically since the nineteenth century, with the decline in religious observance, enlargement of the middle class, and increased ethnic diversity. The population of the UK stands at around 62.5 million, with a British diaspora of around 140 million concentrated in Australia, Canada, South Africa, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States.
History of the term.
Greek and Roman writers, between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, name the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland as the "Priteni", the origin of the Latin word "Britannic". Parthenius, a 1st-century Ancient Greek grammarian, and the "Etymologicum Genuinum", a 9th-century lexical encyclopaedia, describe Bretannus (the Latinised form of the Ancient Greek "Βρεττανός") as the Celtic national forefather of the Britons. It has been suggested that this name derives from a Gaullish description translated as "people of the forms", referring to the custom of tattooing or painting their bodies with blue woad.
By 50 BC Greek geographers were using equivalents of "Prettanikē" as a collective name for the British Isles. However, with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term "Britannia" was used for the island of Great Britain, and later Roman occupied Britain south of Caledonia. Following the Roman departure from Britain, the island of Great Britain was left open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors such as Saxons and Jutes who gained control in areas around the south east.
In this post-Roman period, as the Anglo-Saxons advanced, territory controlled by the Britons became confined to what would later be Wales, Cornwall and North West England. However, the term Britannia persisted as the Latin name for the island. The "Historia Brittonum" claimed legendary origins as a prestigious genealogy for Brittonic kings, followed by the "Historia Regum Britanniae" which popularised this pseudo-history to support the claims of the Kings of England.
During the Middle Ages, and particularly in the Tudor period, the term British was applied to the Welsh people. At this time, it was "the long held belief that the Welsh were descendants of the ancient Britons and that they spoke 'the British tongue. This notion was supported by texts such as the "Historia Regum Britanniae", a pseudohistorical account of ancient British history, written in the mid-12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth. The "Historia Regum Britanniae" chronicled the lives of legendary kings of the Britons in a narrative spanning a time of two thousand years, beginning with the Trojans founding the ancient British nation and continuing until the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain in the 7th century forced the Celtic Britons to the west coast, namely Wales and Cornwall. This legendary Celtic history of Great Britain is known as the Matter of Britain. The Matter of Britain, a national myth, was retold or reinterpreted in works by Gerald of Wales, a Cambro-Norman chronicler who in the 12th and 13th centuries used the term British to refer to what were later known as the Welsh.
History.
Ancestral roots.
Traditional accounts of the ancestral roots of the British have taught that they are descended from diverse populations: the Scots, Welsh, Cornish and Irish from the Celts, and the English from the Anglo-Saxons, who invaded from northern Europe and drove the Celts to Great Britain's western and northern fringes; each are also thought to have a small portion of Viking heritage. However, modern studies using DNA analysis, popularized by the geneticist Stephen Oppenheimer and others, increasingly suggest that three quarters of Britons share a common ancestry with the hunter-gatherers who settled in Atlantic Europe during the Paleolithic era, "after the melting of the ice caps but before the land broke away from the mainland and divided into islands".
Despite the separation of the British Isles from continental Europe as a consequence of the last ice age, the genetic record indicates the British and Irish broadly share a closest common ancestry with the Basque people who live in the Basque Country by the Pyrenees. Oppenheimer continues that the majority of the people of the British Isles share genetic commonalities with the Basques, ranging from highs of 90% in Wales to lows of 66% in East Anglia.
The difference between western Britain and the East of England is thought to have its origins to two divergent prehistoric routes of immigration — one up the Atlantic coast, the other from continental Europe. Major immigrant settlement of the British Isles occurred during the Neolithic period, interpreted by Bryan Sykes—professor of human genetics at the University of Oxford—as the arrival of the Celts from the Iberian Peninsula, and the origin of Britain's and Ireland's Celtic tribes.
Oppenheimer's opinion is that ".."by far the majority of male gene types in the British Isles derive from Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal), ranging from a low of 59% in Fakenham, Norfolk to highs of 96% in Llangefni, north Wales"". The National Museum Wales state that "it is possible that future genetic studies of ancient and modern human DNA may help to inform our understanding of the subject" but "early studies have, so far, tended to produce implausible conclusions from very small numbers of people and using outdated assumptions about linguistics and archaeology."
Between the 8th and 11th centuries, "three major cultural divisions" had emerged in Britain; the English, Scottish and Welsh. The English had unified under a single nation state in 937 by King Athelstan of Wessex after the Battle of Brunanburh. Before then, the English (known then in Old English as the "Anglecynn") were under the governance of independent Anglo-Saxon petty kingdoms which gradually coalesced into a Heptarchy of seven powerful states, the most powerful of which were Mercia and Wessex. Scottish historian and archaeologist Neil Oliver said that the Battle of Brunanburh would "define the shape of Britain into the modern era", it was a "showdown for two very different ethnic identities – a Norse Celtic alliance versus Anglo Saxon. It aimed to settle once and for all whether Britain would be controlled by a single imperial power or remain several separate independent kingdoms, a split in perceptions which is still very much with us today". However, historian Simon Schama suggested that it was Edward I of England who was solely "responsible for provoking the peoples of Britain into an awareness of their nationhood" in the 13th century. Scottish national identity, "a complex amalgam" of Gael, Pict, Norsemen and Anglo-Norman, was not finally forged until the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.
Though Wales was conquered by England, and its legal system annexed into that of the Kingdom of England by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542, the Welsh people endured as a nation distinct from that of the English people. Later, with both an English Reformation and a Scottish Reformation, Edward VI of England under the council of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, advocated the Kingdom of Scotland joining England and Wales in a united Protestant Britain. The Duke of Somerset supported the unification of the English, Welsh and Scottish people under the "indifferent old name of Britons" on the basis that their monarchies "both derived from a Pre-Roman British monarchy".
Following the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, the throne of England was inherited by James VI, King of Scots, which resulted in the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland being united by a personal union under James VI of Scotland and I of England; an event referred to as the Union of the Crowns. King James advocated full political union between England and Scotland, and on 20 October 1604 proclaimed his assumption of the style "King of Great Britain" though this title was rejected by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland and so had no basis in either English law or Scots law.
Union and the development of Britishness.
Despite centuries of military and religious conflict, the Kingdoms of England and Scotland had been "drawing increasingly together" since the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century and the Union of the Crowns in 1603. A broadly shared language, island, monarch, religion and Bible (the Authorized King James Version) further contributed to a growing cultural alliance between the two sovereign realms and their peoples. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 resulted in a pair of Acts of Parliament by the English and Scottish legislatures—the Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 respectively—which ensured that the shared constitutional monarchy of England and Scotland was held only by Protestants. Despite this, although popular with the monarchy and much of the aristocracy, attempts to unite the two states by Acts of Parliament, in 1606, 1667, and 1689 were unsuccessful; increased political management of Scottish affairs from England had led to "criticism", and strained Anglo-Scottish relations.
While English maritime explorations during the Age of Discovery provided new found imperial power and wealth for the English and Welsh at the end of the 17th century, Scotland suffered from a long-standing weak economy. In response, the Scottish kingdom, in opposition to William II of Scotland (III of England), commenced the Darien Scheme, an attempt to establish a Scottish imperial outlet—the colony of New Caledonia—on the isthmus of Panama. However, through a combination of Scottish mismanagement and English sabotage, this imperial venture ended in "catastrophic failure" with an estimated "25% of Scotland's total liquid capital" lost.
The events of the Darien Scheme coupled with the English Parliament passing the Act of Settlement 1701 asserting the right to choose the order of succession for English, Scottish and Irish thrones escalated political hostilities between England and Scotland, and neutralised calls for a united British people. The Parliament of Scotland responded by passing the Act of Security 1704, allowing it to appoint a different monarch to succeed to the Scottish crown from that of England, if it so wished. The English political perspective was that the appointment of a Jacobite monarchy in Scotland opened up the possibility of a Franco-Scottish military conquest of England during the Second Hundred Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. The Alien Act 1705 was passed by the Parliament of England which provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property, whilst also restricting the import of Scottish products into England and its colonies (about half of Scotland's trade). However, the act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Parliament of Scotland entered into negotiations regarding the creation of a unified Parliament of Great Britain, which in turn would refund Scottish financial losses on the Darien Scheme.
Despite opposition from much of the Scottish, and English populations, a Treaty of Union was agreed in 1706 that was then ratified by each parliament passing Acts of Union 1707. With effect from 1 May 1707, this created a new sovereign state called Great Britain. This kingdom "began as a hostile merger", but led to a "full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world"; historian Simon Schama stated "it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."
After 1707, a British national identity began to develop though initially resisted—particularly by the English—the peoples of Great Britain had by the 1750s begun to assume a "layered identity", to think of themselves as simultaneously British and also Scottish, English, or Welsh.
The terms North Briton and South Briton were devised for the Scottish and English, with the former gaining some preference in Scotland, particularly by the economists and philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment. Indeed, it was the "Scots played key roles in shaping the contours of British identity"; "their scepticism about the Union allowed the Scots the space and time in which
to dominate the construction of Britishness in its early crucial years", drawing upon the notion of a shared "spirit of liberty common to both Saxon and Celt ... against the usurpation of the Church of Rome". James Thomson was a poet and playwright born to a Church of Scotland minister in the Scottish Lowlands in 1700 who was interested in forging a common British culture and national identity in this way. In collaboration with Thomas Arne, they wrote "Alfred", an opera about Alfred the Great's victory against the Vikings performed to Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1740 to commemorate the accession of George I and the birthday of Princess Augusta. "Rule, Britannia!" was the climatic piece of the opera and quickly became a "jingoistic" British patriotic song celebrating "Britain's supremacy offshore". An island country with a series of victories for the Royal Navy associated empire and naval warfare "inextricably with ideals of Britishness and Britain's place in the world".
Britannia, the new national personification of Great Britain, was established in the 1750s as a representation of "nation and empire rather than any single national hero". On Britannia and British identity, historian Peter Borsay wrote: 
From the Union of 1707 through to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Great Britain was "involved in successive, very dangerous wars with Catholic France", but which "all brought enough military and naval victories ... to flatter British pride". As the Napoleonic Wars with the First French Empire advanced, "the English and Scottish learned to define themselves as similar primarily by virtue of not being French or Catholic". In combination with sea power and empire, the notion of Britishness became more "closely bound up with Protestantism", a cultural commonality through which the English, Scots and Welsh became "fused together, and remain so, despite their many cultural divergences".
The proliferation of neo-classical monuments at the end of the 18th century and start of the 19th, such as The Kymin at Monmouth, were attempts to meld the concepts of Britishness with the Greco-Roman empires of classical antiquity. The new and expanding British Empire provided "unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility and the accumulations of wealth", and so the "Scottish, Welsh and Irish populations were prepared to suppress nationalist issues on pragmatic grounds". The British Empire was "crucial to the idea of a British identity and to the self-image of Britishness". Indeed, the Scottish welcomed Britishness during the 19th century "for it offered a context within which they could hold on to their own identity whilst participating in, and benefiting from, the expansion of the Empire". Similarly, the "new emphasis of Britishness was broadly welcomed by the Welsh who considered themselves to be the lineal descendants of the ancient Britons – a word that was still used to refer exclusively to the Welsh". For the English however, by the Victorian era their enthusiastic adoption of Britishness meant that for them it "meant the same as 'Englishness'", so much so that "Englishness and Britishness" and "'England' and 'Britain' were used interchangeably in a variety of contexts". Britishness came to borrow heavily upon English political history because England had "always been the dominant component of the British Isles in terms of size, population and power"; Magna Carta, common law and hostility to continental Europe were English factors that influenced British sensibilities.
The political union of the predominantly Catholic Kingdom of Ireland with Great Britain in 1800 coupled with outbreak of peace with France in the early 19th century, challenged the previous century's concept of militant Protestant Britishness. The new, expanded United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland meant that the state had to re-evaulate its position on the civil rights of Catholics, and extend its definition of Britishness to the Irish people. Like terms that had been invented around the of the Acts of Union 1707, West Briton was introduced for the Irish after 1800. In 1832 Daniel O'Connell, an Irish politician who campaigned for Catholic Emancipation, stated in Britain's House of Commons: 
Ireland, from 1801 to 1923, was marked by a succession of economic and political mismanagement and neglect, which marginalised the Irish, and advanced Irish nationalism. In the forty years that followed the union, successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had, as Benjamin Disraeli put it in 1844, "a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, and an alien Church, and in addition the weakest executive in the world". Although the vast majority of Unionists in Ireland proclaimed themselves "simultaneously Irish and British", even for them there was a strain upon the adoption of Britishness after the Great Famine.
War continued to be a unifying factor for the people of Great Britain; British jingoism re-emerged during the Boer Wars in southern Africa. The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the British Empire led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility for Britishness. In 1887, Frederic Harrison wrote: 
The Catholic Relief Act 1829 reflected a "marked change in attitudes" in Great Britain towards Catholics and Catholicism. A "significant" example of this was the collaboration between Augustus Welby Pugin, an "ardent Roman Catholic" and son of a Frenchman, and Sir Charles Barry, "a confirmed Protestant", in redesigning the Palace of Westminster—"the building that most enshrines ... Britain's national and imperial pre-tensions". Protestantism gave way to imperialism as the leading element of British national identity during the Victorian and Edwardian eras, and as such, a series of Royal, imperial and national celebrations were introduced to the British people to assert imperial British culture and give themselves a sense of uniqueness, superiority and national consciousness. Empire Day and jubilees of Queen Victoria were introduced to the British middle class, but quickly "merged into a national 'tradition'".
Modern period.
The First World War "reinforced the sense of Britishness" and patriotism in the early 20th century. Through war service (including conscription in Great Britain), "the English, Welsh, Scots and Irish fought as British". The aftermath of the war institutionalised British national commemoration through Remembrance Sunday and the Poppy Appeal. The Second World War had a similar unifying effect upon the British people, however, its outcome was to recondition Britishness on a basis of democratic values and its marked contrast to Europeanism. Notions that the British "constituted an Island race, and that it stood for democracy were reinforced during the war and they were circulated in the country through Winston Churchill's speeches, history books and newspapers".
At its international zenith, "Britishness joined peoples around the world in shared traditions and common loyalities that were strenuously maintained". But following the two world wars, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation. The secession of the Irish Free State from the United Kingdom meant that Britishness had lost "its Irish dimension" in 1922, and the shrinking empire supplanted by independence movements dwindled the appeal of British identity in the Commonwealth of Nations during the mid-20th century.
Since the mass immigration to the United Kingdom from the Commonwealth and elsewhere in the world, and the British Nationality Act 1948, "the expression and experience of cultural life in Britain has become fragmented and reshaped by the influences of gender, ethnicity, class and region". Furthermore, the effect of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Economic Community in 1973 eroded the concept of Britishness as distinct from continental Europe. As such, since the 1970s "there has been a sense of crisis about what it has meant to be British", exacerbated by growing demands for greater political autonomy for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.
The late-20th century saw major changes to the politics of the United Kingdom with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales following pre-legislative referendums. Calls for greater autonomy for the four countries of the United Kingdom had existed since their original union with each other, but gathered pace in the 1960s and 1970s. Devolution has led to "increasingly assertive Scottish, Welsh and Irish national identities", resulting in more diverse cultural expressions of Britishness, or else its outright rejection; Gwynfor Evans, a Welsh nationalist politician active in the late-20th century, rebuffed Britishness as "a political synonym for Englishness which extends English culture over the Scots, Welsh and the Irish".
In 2004 Sir Bernard Crick, political theorist and democratic socialist tasked with developing the life in the United Kingdom test said: 
Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, initiated a debate on British identity in 2006. Brown's speech to the Fabian Society's Britishness Conference proposed that British values demand a new constitutional settlement and symbols to represent a modern patriotism, including a new youth community service scheme and a British Day to celebrate. One of the central issues identified at the Fabian Society conference was how the English identity fits within the framework of a devolved United Kingdom. An expression of Her Majesty's Government's initiative to promote Britishness was the inaugural Veterans' Day which was first held on 27 June 2006. As well as celebrating the achievements of armed forces veterans, Brown's speech at the first event for the celebration said: 
Geographic distribution.
[[File:British expats countrymap.svg|thumb|350px|right|A world map showing the distribution and concentration of Britons by country. Legend:
]]
British people - people with British citizenship or of British descent - have a significant presence in a number of countries other than the United Kingdom, and in particular in those with historic connections to the British Empire. After the Age of Discovery the British were one of the earliest and largest communities to emigrate out of Europe, and the British Empire's expansion during the first half of the 19th century triggered an "extraordinary dispersion of the British people", resulting in particular concentrations "in Australasia and North America".
The British Empire was "built on waves of migration overseas by British people", who left the United Kingdom and "reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures in three continents". As a result of the British colonisation of the Americas, what became the United States was "easily the greatest single destination of emigrant British", but in Australia the British experienced a birth rate higher than "anything seen before" resulting in the displacement of indigenous Australians.
In colonies such as Southern Rhodesia, British East Africa and Cape Colony, permanently resident British communities were established and whilst never more than a numerical minority these Britons "exercised a dominant influence" upon the culture and politics of those lands. In Australia, Canada and New Zealand "people of British origin came to constitute the majority of the population" contributing to these states becoming integral to the Anglosphere.
The United Kingdom Census 1861 estimated the size of the overseas British to be around 2.5 million, but concluded that most of these were "not conventional settlers" but rather "travellers, merchants, professionals, and military personnel". By 1890, there were over 1.5 million further British-born people living in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. A 2006 publication from the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated 5.6 million Britons lived outside of the United Kingdom.
Australia.
From the beginning of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up a large majority of people coming to Australia, meaning that many Australian-born people can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, was part of the eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.
Its history of British dominance meant that Australia was "grounded in British culture and political traditions that had been transported to the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century and become part of colonial culture and politics". Australia maintains the Westminster system of Parliamentary Government and Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia. Until 1987, the national status of Australian citizens was formally described as "British Subject: Citizen of Australia". Britons continue to make up a substantial proportion of immigrants.
British overseas territories.
The people of the British overseas territories are British by citizenship, via origins or naturalisation. Along with aspects of common British identity, each of them has their own distinct identity shaped in the respective particular circumstances of political, economic, ethnic, social and cultural history. For instance, in the case of the Falkland Islanders, Lewis Clifton the Speaker of the Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands, explains: 
In contrast, for the majority of the Gibraltarian people, who live in Gibraltar, there is an "insistence on their Britishness" which "carries excessive loyalty" to Britain. The sovereignty of Gibraltar has been a point of contention in Spain–United Kingdom relations, but an overwhelming number of Gibraltarians embrace Britishness with strong conviction, in direct opposition to Spanish territorial claims.
Canada.
Canada traces its statehood to the French, English and Scottish expeditions of North America from the late-15th century. France ceded nearly all of New France in 1763 after the Seven Years' War, and so after the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776, Quebec and Nova Scotia formed "the nucleus of the colonies that constituted Britain's remaining stake on the North American continent". British North America attracted the United Empire Loyalists, British people who migrated out of what they considered the "rebellious" United States, increasing the size of British communities in what was to become Canada.
In 1867 there was a union of three colonies with British North America which together formed the Canadian Confederation, a federal dominion. This began an accretion of additional provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the parliament of the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a "continuing importance of Canada's long and close relationship with Britain"; large parts of Canada's modern population claim "British origins" and the cultural impact of the British upon Canada's institutions is profound.
It was not until 1977 that the phrase "A Canadian citizen is a British subject" ceased to be used in Canadian passports. politics of Canada are strongly influenced by British political culture. Although significant modifications have been made, Canada is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system, and retains Elizabeth II as The Queen of Canada and Head of State. English is an official language used in Canada.
Chile.
Chile, facing the Pacific Ocean,
has a large British presence. Over 50,000 British immigrants settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes in Province, especially the city of Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing the Strait of Magellan from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean. Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe.
In Valparaíso they created their largest and most important colony, bringing with them neighbourhoods of British character, schools, social clubs, sports clubs, business organizations and periodicals. Even today their influence is apparent in specific areas, such as the banks and the navy, as well as in certain social activities, such as football (soccer), horse racing, and the custom of drinking tea.
During the movement for independence (1818), it was mainly the British who formed the Chilean Navy, under the command of Lord Cochrane.
British investment helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific. Chile won two wars, the first against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the second, the War of the Pacific, in 1878–79, against an alliance between Peru and Bolivia. The liberal-socialist "Revolution of 1891" introduced political reforms modeled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking.
British immigrants were also important in the northern zone of the country during the saltpetre boom, in the ports of Iquique and Pisagua. The "King of Saltpetre", John Thomas North, was the principal tycoons of nitrate mining. The British legacy is reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of Iquique, with the foundation of various institutions, such as the Club Hípico (Racing Club). Nevertheless, the British active presence came to an end with the saltpetre crisis during the 1930s.
Some Scots settled in the country's more temperate regions, where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland), while English and Welsh made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, arrived as merchants, tradesmen and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports.
An important contingent of British (principally Welsh) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950, settling in the present-day region of Magallanes. British families were established in other areas of the country, such as Santiago, Coquimbo, the Araucanía, and Chiloé.
The cultural legacy of the British in Chile is notable and has spread beyond the British Chilean community onto society at large. One custom taken from the British is afternoon tea — called onces by Chileans, soccer, rugby union and horse racing. Another interesting, although peculiar, legacy is the sheer amount of use of British first surname by Chileans.
Chile currently has the largest population descendants of British in Latin America. Over 700,000 Chileans may have British (English, Scottish and Welsh) origin, amounting to 4.5% of Chile's population.
New Zealand.
A long-term result of James Cook's voyage of 1768–71, a significant number of New Zealanders are of British descent, whom a sense of Britishness has contributed to their identity. As late as the 1950s, it was common for British New Zealanders to refer to themselves as British, such as when Prime Minister Keith Holyoake described Sir Edmund Hillary's successful ascent of Mount Everest as putting "the British race and New Zealand on top of the world". New Zealand passports described nationals as "British Subject: Citizen of New Zealand" until 1974, when this was changed to "New Zealand citizen".
In an interview with the "New Zealand Listener" in 2006, Don Brash, the then Leader of the Opposition, said:
The politics of New Zealand are strongly influenced by British political culture. Although significant modifications have been made, New Zealand is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system, and retains Elizabeth II as the head of the monarchy of New Zealand. English is the dominant official language used in New Zealand.
Hong Kong.
British nationality law as it pertains to Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to today's cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.
Citizenship matters were complicated by the fact that British nationality law treated those born in Hong Kong as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the People's Republic of China (PRC) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as British. The main reason being that recognising these people as British would be seen as tacit acceptance of a series of treaties which the PRC labels as "unequal" – including the ones which ceded Hong Kong island, the Kowloon peninsula and later Hong Kong's New Territories to the UK. However the British government has under the special circumstance of Hong Kong's political reality, granted 3.4 million Hong Kong people a new creation of nationality known as British National (Overseas), which is established in accordance to the Hong Kong Act 1985. Amid those 3.4 million Hong Kong British people, there is also a significant amount of British Nationals (Overseas) who are eligible for full British citizenship. Both British National (Overseas) and British citizen are British national and Commonwealth citizen according to the British Nationality Law, which enables them to various rights in the United Kingdom and further extended to the European Union.
South Africa.
The British arrived in the area which would become the modern-day South Africa during the early 18th century, yet substantial settlement only started end of the 18th century, in the Cape of Good Hope; the British first explored the area for conquests for or related to the Slave Trade. In the late 19th century, the discovery of gold and diamonds further encouraged colonisation of South Africa by the British, and the population of the British-South Africans rose substantially, although there was fierce rivalry between the British and Afrikaners (descendants of Dutch colonists) in the period known as the Boer Wars. When apartheid first started most British-South Africans were mostly keen on keeping and even strengthening its ties with the United Kingdom. The latest census in South Africa showed that there are almost 2 million British-South Africans; they make up about 40% of the total White South African demographic, and currently the greatest white British ancestry populations in South Africa are in the KwaZulu-Natal province and in cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town.
Ireland.
Plantations of Ireland introduced large numbers of English, Scottish and Welsh people to Ireland throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period. The resulting Protestant Ascendancy, the aristocratic class of the Lordship of Ireland, broadly identified themselves as Anglo-Irish. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Protestant British settlers subjugated Catholic, Gaelic inhabitants in the north of Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster and the Williamite War in Ireland; it was "an explicit attempt to control Ireland strategically by introducing ethnic and religious elements loyal to the British interest in Ireland".
The Ulster Scots people are an ethnic group of British origin in Ireland, broadly descended from Lowland Scots who settled in large numbers in the Province of Ulster during the planned process of colonisations of Ireland which took place in the reign of James VI of Scotland and I of England. Together with English and Welsh settlers, these Scots introduced Protestantism (particularly the Presbyterianism of the Church of Scotland) and the Ulster Scots and English languages to, mainly, northeastern Ireland. With the partition of Ireland and independence for what is now the Republic of Ireland some of these people found themselves no longer living within the United Kingdom.
Northern Ireland itself was, for many years, the site of a violent and bitter ethno-sectarian conflict—The Troubles—between those claiming to represent Irish nationalism, who are predominantly Roman Catholic, and those claiming to represent British unionism, who are predominantly Protestant. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, while nationalists desire a united Ireland.
Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, most of the paramilitary groups involved in the Troubles have ceased their armed campaigns, and constitutionally, the people of Northern Ireland have been recognised as "all persons born in Northern Ireland and having, at the time of their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence". The Good Friday Agreement guarantees the "recognition of the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose". Nevertheless, community divisions are still strong, and the unique situation of Britons in Northern Ireland has produced a strong and distinctive British identity which at the extreme is linked with Ulster loyalism and the Orange Institution, but more commonly is "civic in nature", tied with the Protestant work ethic of an "industrious, assertive, self-reliant" people.
United States.
An English presence in North America began with the Roanoke Colony and Colony of Virginia in the late-16th century, but the first successful English settlement was established in 1607, on the James River at Jamestown. By the 1610s an estimated 1,300 English people had travelled to North America, the "first of many millions from the British Isles". In 1620 the Pilgrims established the English imperial venture of Plymouth Colony, beginning "a remarkable acceleration of permanent emigration from England" with over 60% of trans-Atlantic English migrants settling in the New England Colonies. During the 17th century an estimated 350,000 English and Welsh migrants arrived in North America, which in the century after the Acts of Union 1707 was surpassed in rate and number by Scottish and Irish migrants.
The British policy of salutary neglect for its North American colonies intended to minimise trade restrictions as a way of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and subsequently constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain's formal acknowledgement of the United States' sovereignty at the end of the American Revolutionary War.
Nevertheless, longstanding cultural and historical ties have, in more modern times, resulted in the Special Relationship, the historically close political, diplomatic, and military co-operation between the United Kingdom and United States. Linda Colley, a professor of history at Princeton University and specialist in Britishness, suggested that because of their colonial influence on the United States, the British find Americans a "mysterious and paradoxical people, physically distant but culturally close, engagingly similar yet irritatingly different".
Culture.
Result from the expansion of the British Empire, British cultural influence can be observed in the language and culture of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, the United States, and the British overseas territories. These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere. As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly British cuisine. Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, and representative democracy have developed from broader Western culture.
As a result of the history of the formation of the United Kingdom, the cultures of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are diverse and have varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness.
Cuisine.
Historically, British cuisine has meant "unfussy dishes made with quality local ingredients, matched with simple sauces to accentuate flavour, rather than disguise it". It has been "vilified as unimaginative and heavy", and traditionally been limited in its international recognition to the full breakfast and the Christmas dinner. This is despite British cuisine having absorbed the culinary influences of those who have settled in Britain, resulting in hybrid dishes such as the British Asian Chicken tikka masala, hailed by some as "Britain's true national dish".
Celtic agriculture and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for Celts and Britons. The Anglo-Saxons developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe. The Norman conquest of England introduced exotic spices into Britain in the Middle Ages. The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of India's food tradition of "strong, penetrating spices and herbs". Food rationing policies, imposed by the British government during wartime periods of the 20th century, are said to have been the stimulus for British cuisine's poor international reputation.
British dishes include fish and chips, the Sunday roast, and bangers and mash. British cuisine has several national and regional varieties, including English, Scottish and Welsh cuisine, each of which has developed its own regional or local dishes, many of which are geographically indicated foods such as Cheddar cheese, Cheshire cheese, the Yorkshire pudding, Arbroath Smokie, Cornish pasty and Welsh cakes.
The British are the second largest per capita tea consumers in the world, consuming an average of per person each year. British tea culture dates back to the 19th century, when India was part of the British Empire and British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent.
Language.
There is no single British language though English is by far the main language spoken by British citizens, being spoken monolingually by more than 70% of the UK population. English is therefore the "de facto" official language of the United Kingdom. However, under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Cornish, Irish, Ulster Scots and Scots (or Lowland Scots) languages are officially recognised as Regional or Minority languages by the UK Government. As indigenous languages which continue to be spoken as a first language by native inhabitants, Welsh and Scottish Gaelic have a different legal status from other minority languages. In some parts of the UK, some of these languages are commonly spoken as a first language; in wider areas, their use in a bilingual context is sometimes supported and/or promoted by central and/or local government policy. For naturalisation purposes, a competence standard of English, Scottish Gaelic or Welsh is required to pass the life in the United Kingdom test. However, English is used routinely, and although considered culturally important, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are seldom used and are effectively restricted in practice to remote rural areas.
Throughout the United Kingdom there are distinctive spoken expressions and regional accents of English, which are seen to be symptomatic of a locality's culture and identity. An awareness and knowledge of accents in the United Kingdom can "place, within a few miles, the locality in which a man or woman has grown up".
Literature.
British literature is "one of the leading literatures in the world". The overwhelming part is written in the English language, but there are also literatures written in Scots, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh languages amongst others.
Britain has a long history of famous and influential authors. It boasts some of the oldest pieces of literature in the Western world, such as the epic poem Beowulf, one of the oldest surviving written work in the English language.
Famous authors include some of the world's most studied and praised writers. William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe defined England's Elizabethan period. The British Romantic movement was one of the strongest and most recognisable in Europe. The poets William Blake, Wordsworth and Coleridge were amongst the pioneers of Romanticism in literature. Other Romantic writers that followed these figure further enhanced the profile of Romanticism in Europe, such as John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. Later periods like the Victorian Era saw a further flourishing of British writing, including Charles Dickens and William Thackeray.
Women's literature in Britain has had a long and often troubled history, with many female writers producing work under a pen name, such as George Eliot. Other great female novelists that contributed to world literature were the Brontë sisters, Emily, Charlotte and Anne.
Non-fiction has also played an important role in the history of British letters, with the first dictionary of the English language being produced and compiled by Samuel Johnson, a graduate of Oxford University and a London resident.
Media and music.
Although cinema, theatre, dance and live music are popular, the favourite pastime of the British is watching television. Public broadcast television in the United Kingdom began in 1936, with the launch of the BBC Television Service (now BBC One). In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, one must have a television licence to legally receive any broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions, and the Internet. Revenue generated from the television licence is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Welsh language television programmes for S4C. The BBC, the common abbreviation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the world's largest broadcaster. Unlike other broadcasters in the UK, it is a public service based, quasi-autonomous, statutory corporation run by the BBC Trust. Free-to-air terrestrial television channels available on a national basis are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 (S4C in Wales), and Five.
100 Greatest British Television Programmes was a list compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000, chosen by a poll of industry professionals, to determine what were the greatest British television programmes of any genre ever to have been screened. Topping the list was "Fawlty Towers", a British sitcom set in a fictional Torquay hotel starring John Cleese.
"British musical tradition is essentially vocal", dominated by the music of England and Germanic culture, most greatly influenced by hymns and Anglican church music. However, the specific, traditional music of Wales and music of Scotland is distinct, and of the Celtic musical tradition. In the United Kingdom, more people attend live music performances than football matches. British rock was born in the mid-20th century out of the influence of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from the United States. Major early exports were The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks. Together with other bands from the United Kingdom, these constituted the British Invasion, a popularisation of British pop and rock music in the United States. Into the 1970s heavy metal, new wave, and 2 tone. Britpop is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the British independent music scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands reviving British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s. Leading exponents of Britpop were Blur, Oasis and Pulp. Also popularised in the United Kingdom during the 1990s were several domestically produced varieties of electronic dance music; acid house, UK hard house, jungle, UK garage which in turn have influenced grime and British hip hop in the 2000s. The BRIT Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's annual awards for both international and British popular music.
Religion.
Historically, Christianity "has been the most influential and important religion in Britain", and it remains the declared faith of the majority of the British people. The influence of Christianity on British culture has been "widespread, extending beyond the spheres of prayer and worship. Churches and cathedrals make a significant contribution to the architectural landscape of the nation's cities and towns" whilst "many schools and hospitals were founded by men and women who were strongly influenced by Christian motives". Throughout the United Kingdom, Easter and Christmas, the "two most important events in the Christian calendar", are recognised as public holidays.
Christianity remains the major religion of the population of the United Kingdom in the 21st century, followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and then Judaism in terms of number of adherents. The 2007 Tearfund Survey revealed 53% identified themselves as Christian which was similar to the 2004 British Social Attitudes Survey, and to the United Kingdom Census 2001 in which 71.6% said that Christianity was their religion, However, the Tearfund Survey showed only one in ten Britons attend church weekly. Secularism was advanced in Britain during the Age of Enlightenment, and modern British organisations such as the British Humanist Association and the National Secular Society offer the opportunity for their members to "debate and explore the moral and philosophical issues in a non-religious setting".
The Treaty of Union that led to the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured that there would be a protestant succession as well as a link between church and state that still remains. The Church of England (Anglican) is legally recognised as the established church, and so retains representation in the parliament of the United Kingdom through the Lords Spiritual, whilst the British monarch is a member of the church as well as its Supreme Governor. The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament. The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members, mainly in England. There are also growing Orthodox, Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, with Pentecostal churches in England now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance. Other large Christian groups include Methodists and Baptists.
The presbyterian Church of Scotland (known informally as The Kirk), is recognised as the national church of Scotland and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the church upon his or her accession. The Roman Catholic Church in Scotland is Scotland's second largest Christian church, with followers representing a sixth of the population of Scotland. The Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland over matters of theology and ritual. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the 19th century, led to the creation of other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the Free Church of Scotland. In the 1920s, the Church in Wales became independent from the Church of England and became 'disestablished' but remains in the Anglican Communion. Methodism and other protestant churches have had a major presence in Wales. The main religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all-Ireland basis. Though collectively Protestants constitute the overall majority, the Roman Catholic Church of Ireland is the largest single church. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, closely linked to the Church of Scotland in terms of theology and history, is the second largest church followed by the Church of Ireland (Anglican) which was disestablished in the 19th century.
Sport.
Sport is an important element of British culture, and is one of the most popular leisure activities of British people. Within the United Kingdom, nearly half of all adults partake in one or more sporting activity each week. Some of the major sports in the United Kingdom "were invented by the British", including football, rugby union, rugby league and cricket, and "exported various other games" including tennis, badminton, boxing, golf, snooker and squash.
In most sports, separate organisations, teams and clubs represent the individual countries of the United Kingdom at international level, though in some sports, like rugby union, an all-Ireland team represents both Northern Ireland and the Republic, and the British and Irish Lions represent the isles as a whole. The UK is represented by a single team at the Olympic Games and at the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Great Britain team won 65 medals: 29 gold (the most since the 1908 Summer Olympics), 17 silver and 19 bronze, ranking them 3rd. In total, sportsmen and women from the UK "hold over 50 world titles in a variety of sports, such as professional boxing, rowing, snooker, squash and motorcycle sports".
A 2006 poll found that association football was the most popular sport in the UK. In England 320 football clubs are affiliated to The Football Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs to regional or district associations. The FA, founded in 1863, and the Football League, founded in 1888, were both the first of their kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78 full and associate clubs and nearly 6,000 registered clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Football Association. One Welsh club play in England's Football League, one in the Premier league, and others at non-league level, whilst the Welsh Football League contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In Northern Ireland, 12 semi-professional clubs play in the IFA Premiership, the second oldest league in the world.
Recreational fishing, particularly angling, is one of the most popular participation activities in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 3—4 million anglers in the country. The most widely practised form of angling in England and Wales is for coarse fish while in Scotland angling is usually for salmon and trout.
Visual art and architecture.
For centuries, artists and architects in Britain were overwhelmingly influenced by Western art history. Amongst the first visual artists credited for developing a distinctly British aesthetic and artistic style is William Hogarth. The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the British Empire, led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom. Britons used their art "to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world", whilst the permanent settlers in British North America, Australasia, and South Africa "embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity". The empire has been "at the centre, rather than in the margins, of the history of British art", and imperial British visual arts have been fundamental to the construction, celebration and expression of Britishness.
British attitudes to modern art were "polarised" at the end of the 19th century. Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by "many conservative critics" as a "subversive foreign influence", but became "fully assimilated" into British art during the early-20th century. Representational art was described by Herbert Read during the interwar period as "necessarily... revolutionary", and was studied and produced to such an extent that by the 1950s, Classicism was effectively void in British visual art. Post-modern, contemporary British art, particularly that of the Young British Artists, has been pre-occupied with postcolonialism, and "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture ... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety".
Architecture of the United Kingdom is diverse; most influential developments have usually taken place in England, but Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have at various times played leading roles in architectural history. Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the British Isles, British architecture effectively begins with the first Anglo-Saxon Christian churches, built soon after Augustine of Canterbury arrived in Great Britain in 597. Norman architecture was built on a vast scale from the 11th century onwards in the form of castles and churches to help impose Norman authority upon their dominion. English Gothic architecture, which flourished between 1180 until around 1520, was initially imported from France, but quickly developed its own unique qualities. Secular medieval architecture throughout Britain has left a legacy of large stone castles, with the "finest examples" being found lining both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border, dating from the Wars of Scottish Independence of the 14th century. The invention of gunpowder and canons made castles redundant, and the English Renaissance which followed facilitiated the development of new artistic styles for domestic architecture: Tudor style, English Baroque, The Queen Anne Style and Palladian. Georgian and Neoclassical architecture advanced after the Scottish Enlightenment. Outwith the United Kingdom, the influence of British architecture is particularly strong in South India, the result of British rule in India in the 19th century. The Indian cities of Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai each have courts, hotels and train stations designed in British architectural styles of Gothic Revivalism and neoclassicism.
Political culture.
British political culture is tied closely with its institutions and civics, and a "subtle fusion of new and old values". The principle of constitutional monarchy, with its notions of stable parliamentary government and political liberalism, "have come to dominate British culture". These views have been reinforced by Sir Bernard Crick who said: 
British political institutions include the Westminster system, the Commonwealth of Nations and Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Although the Privy Council is primarily a British institution, officials from other Commonwealth realms are also appointed to the body. The most notable continuing instance is the Prime Minister of New Zealand, its senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal judges are conventionally made Privy Counsellors, as formerly were the prime ministers and chief justices of Canada and Australia. Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries which retain the British monarch as their sovereign continue to be sworn as Privy Counsellors.
Universal suffrage for all males over 21 was granted in 1918 and for adult women in 1930 after the Suffragette movement. Politics in the United Kingdom is multi-party, with three dominant political parties: the Conservative Party, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats (or 'Lib Dems'). The social structure of Britain, specifically social class, has "long been pre-eminent among the factors used to explain party allegiance", and still persists as "the dominant basis" of party political allegiance for British people. The Conservative Party is descended from the historic Tory Party (founded in England in 1678), and is a centre-right conservative political party, which traditionally draws support from the middle classes. The Labour Party(founded by Scotsman Keir Hardie) grew out of the trade union movement and socialist political parties of the 19th century, and continues to describe itself as a "democratic socialist party". Labour states that it stands for the representation of the low-paid working class, who have traditionally been its members and voters. The Liberal Democrats are a liberal political party, and third largest in the United Kingdom. It is descended from the Liberal Party, a major ruling party of late-19th century Britain through to the First World War, when it was supplanted by the Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats have historically drawn support from wide and "differing social backgrounds". There are over 300 other, smaller political parties in the United Kingdom registered to the Electoral Commission.
Classification.
According to the British Social Attitudes Survey, there are broadly two interpretations of British identity, with ethnic and civic dimensions:
Of the two perspectives of British identity, the civic definition has become "the dominant idea ... by far", and in this capacity, Britishness is sometimes considered an institutional or overarching state identity. This has been used to explain why first-, second- and third-generation immigrants are more likely to describe themselves as British, rather than English, Scottish or Welsh, because it is an "institutional, inclusive" identity, that can be acquired through naturalisation and British nationality law; the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom who are from an ethnic minority feel British.
However, this attitude is more common in England than in Scotland or Wales; "white English people perceived themselves as English first and as British second, and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds perceived themselves as British, but none identified as English, a label they associated exclusively with white people". Contrawise, in Scotland and Wales, White British and ethnic minority people both identified more strongly with Scotland and Wales than with Britain.
Studies and surveys have "reported that the majority of the Scots and Welsh see themselves as both Scottish/Welsh and British though with some differences in emphasis". The Commission for Racial Equality found that with respect to notions of nationality in Britain, "the most basic, objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English, the Scots and the Welsh". However, "English participants tended to think of themselves as indistinguishably English or British, while both Scottish and Welsh participants identified themselves much more readily as Scottish or Welsh than as British".
Some persons opted "to combine both identities" as "they felt Scottish or Welsh, but held a British passport and were therefore British", whereas others saw themselves as exclusively Scottish or exclusively Welsh and "felt quite divorced from the British, whom they saw as the English". Commentators have described this latter phenomenon as "nationalism", a rejection of British identity because some Scots and Welsh interpret it as "cultural imperialism imposed" upon the United Kingdom by "English ruling elites", or else a response to a historical misappropriation of equating the word "English" with "British", which has "brought about a desire among Scots, Welsh and Irish to learn more about their heritage and distinguish themselves from the broader British identity".

Aora

Aora is an Indonesian direct broadcast satellite pay television company that is operated by PT Karyamegah Adijaya and is owned by Rini M. Soemarno, Ongki P. Soemarno and join at dormant period Sugiono Wiyono. It started its nation-wide broadcast in the beginning of August 2008 with an initial 10 channels, highlighting the 2008 Summer Olympics. Four of the channels were dedicated to Olympic coverage. Aora earned the exclusive broadcasting rights to the 2008 Olympics exclusively for Indonesia.
Still in August 2008, Aora TV won the sole rights in Indonesia to broadcast the 2008–09 season of the Premier League and offered a new, 12-channel package service which included ESPN and STAR Sports, which contains the English Premier League (EPL) content. This allows Aora subscribers to watch, in full, the 370 EPL matches of the 2008/2009 season, including preview shows and weekly highlights. The Premier League broadcast rights were then expired just few hours before the start of the 2009/2010 season, that forced Aora to replace both channels with Goal TV 1 and Goal TV 2 effective on August 15, 2009. At the same time, Aora also added several new channels into its channels lineup. Due to there are no exclusive EPL matches again, Aora TV loss a lot of the subscribers and at end of 2009 Aora TV discontinued all of the broadcast followed by curtailment of 90 percent of the employees. At January 2010 Aora TV re-broadcast, but not as Premium/Exclusive Pay TV as before. At the current Aora TV try as medium to low income market with the lowest subscription fee Rp.59,000 (around $7) per month.
In Q3 2011, Aora launched "Aora HD", an HD programming consisting of HBO HD, Star Movies HD, Discovery HD World, NGC HD, ASN, ESPN HD, FoodNetwork HD, Cartoon Network HD, HBO Hits HD and KompasTV HD. Fees are only for decoder rental which goes for Rp.99,000 (approximately US$11) per month.

Movement Against War and Fascism

The Movement Against War and Fascism (MAWF) was founded in Australia in 1933, as an Australian chapter of the World Movement Against War established in 1932 by the Comintern. The international movement was instigated by Willi Münzenberg the German Comintern leader who founded a multitude of front organisations in his quest to spread the word and power of International Communism. The Australian movement set out to attract "fellow-travellers" and pacifists, and was relatively independent of the international organisation. 
MAWF organised political rallies and protests and issued the magazine "War! What For?" (February 1934 - May 1936), later "World Peace" (June 1936 - June 1939), to expose the development of fascism in Europe in the 1930s - particularly in Germany and Italy, and during the Spanish Civil War - while promoting the cause of Communism. The movement disbanded in 1939.
The movement instigated the events which led to the attempted exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia in late 1934 and early 1935. During the 1936 to 1939 Spanish Civil War, the MAWF played a prominent role in publicising stories from the front and condemned democratic governments for failing to come to the aid of the elected socialist government while fascist governments were supporting the right-wing rebels led by General Francisco Franco. 
The organisation continued to criticise democratic governments, including that led by Joseph Lyons in Australia, for anti-free speech and anti-Communist policies, which some historians have argued weakened its otherwise prescient message about the escalating threat posed by fascism and Nazism. Indeed, the main debate between historians with an interest in the MAWF has been a preoccupation about the extent to which it was first and foremost a Communist front organisation.
Australian members included Mary Wren whose communist sympathies ran in stark contrast to her father John Wren's conservative Catholicism, Hugo Throssell, and federal Labor politician Maurice Blackburn, who was expelled from the ALP in 1937 for his membership of the MAWF. Secretary and editor of the MAWF magazine, James Normington Rawling, was a dominating figure in the organisation's policies and messages until the organisation folded with the onset of World War in late 1939. Rawling was expelled from the Communist Party for unorthodox views and became a prominent anti-Communist.

Ramage (novel)

Ramage is the first novel in the Lord Ramage novels by Dudley Pope. It is
set during the French Revolutionary Wars and later in the series during the Napoleonic wars.
Plot.
Nicholas Lord Ramage is the third lieutenant on His Majesty's ship "Sibella", but assumes command when the Captain, and the First and Second Lieutenants are killed by fire from a French ship. The French ship had fatally crippled the "Sibella" and had killed over half of her crew, including the surgeon and surgeon's mate. As the new Captain, Ramage decides to abandon the sinking ship. He leaves the injured on the deck to be taken prisoner by the French and hopefully treated by their surgeon. Before he abandons the ship, Ramage retrieves some documents and the late Captain's last orders. The remaining crew then loads into the four lifeboats and rows away. As they are rowing away, the crew of the French ship set the "Sibella" on fire after taking the injured off.
Ramage opens Sir John Jervis's orders to the late Captain and finds that the "Sibella" was on a rescue mission to extricate the Marchesa di Volterri along with five other nobles including the Marchesa's two cousins. Austria was proving unable to defend its possessions in northern Italy, despite the subsidies the British government was paying to support the Austrian army. Britain, unable to deploy major forces on the European continent, used its commercial power to bolster the land armies of allies like Austria and Spain against the French for over a decade. Ramage decides to go through with the rescue. He takes the captain's gig with several topmen and the former Captain's coxswain, Jackson, with him and sends the other surviving sailors to Bastia. Ramage and his men then land upon Monte Argentario and find the Marchesa with the help of a local charcoal maker.
Half of the nobles decide not to risk trying to escape in a small boat, but Ramage rescues the Marchesa and one of her cousins, Count Pisano, although the other cousin, Count Pitti, is apparently killed by Napoleon's cavalry during the escape. The refugees are eventually picked up by the "Lively" frigate under the command of Captain Probus. That night Pisano accuses Ramage of cowardice in connection with the death of Count Pitti, submitting a formal accusation to Probus. During their time together, the Marchesa and Ramage develop a Romeo-and-Juliet-esque relationship, with the conniving of her family and the demands of discretion upon them.
After the Marchesa is safe, Ramage is sent to trial according to the Articles of War for his loss of the "Sibella." Captain Croucher, a political enemy of Ramage's father, brings the accusation of cowardice into the trial. Ramage's trial is interrupted by Lord Nelson's arrival, effectively ending the trial. Nelson gives him the command of the cutter "Kathleen" sending him to rescue the crew of the frigate HMS "Belette" which had run aground and was under fire from Napoleon's troops. Ramage saves the stranded crew and returns to Nelson. Upon his return, he learns that Count Pitti, who he had been unable to rescue had not been killed, but instead had hidden and later escaped. The book ends as Ramage considers his orders to carry the Marchesa and Count Pitti to Gibraltar.

Critical reaction.
Many reviewers, such as the New York Times, praised "Ramage" as "A grand tale written with panache, glitter and awesome authority, one can only rejoice that a crying need has been filled".
'A splendid battlescape, a running adventure ashore...a good story' Evening Standard 2
In response to the novel, Orville Prescott wrote that "Dudley Pope has kept his story scudding along before a fine wind," and "Therewith predict that Lieut. Nicholas Ramage, commander of His Majesty's cutter Kathleen, will enjoy a highly successful career and survive some of the most perilous adventures experienced by any British naval officer in the entire history of the Napoleonic Wars."

BATCO

BATCO, short for Battle Code, is a hand-held, paper-based encryption system used at a low, front line (platoon, troop and section) level in the British Army. It was introduced along with the Clansman combat net radio in the early 1980s and was largely obsolete by 2010 due to the wide deployment of the secure Bowman radios. BATCO consists of a code, contained on a set of vocabulary cards, and cipher sheets for superencryption of the numeric code words. The cipher sheets, which are typically changed daily, also include an authentication table and a radio call sign protection system. 
BATCO is similar to older Slidex system. The use of BATCO is still taught to Royal Signals Communication Systems Operators as a back-up should secure equipment fail or be unavailable. It is also taught to Army Cadets and Combined Cadets as part of the Signal Classification qualification. BATCO documents are classified as "Restricted" information.
The BATCO code.
Messages in BATCO are first encoded into numbers using one of several vocabulary cards. The BATCO cipher is then used to encrypt the numbers into letters, which can be transmitted over unsecure channels. The process is reversed at the receiving end. 
Each BATCO vocabulary card groups words needed for a particular function, so card changes are infrequent. Every vocabulary word on a card is assigned a two digit code. Some vocabulary card entries call for a fixed number of digits after the two digit code. For example, the code for ETA (estimated time of arrival) is followed by a four digit time of day. Each card in a set has a three digit number and there is always a code word on the card that means switch to card number xxx. 
The BATCO cipher.
Each BATCO cipher sheet is composed of a double-sided sheet of about A5 size that fits in a specially made BATCO wallet. Each single side is usually valid for 24 Hours. The wallet has a slide that aids in reading the tables correctly.
The plaintext character set in BATCO consists of 12 symbols, the digits 0 to 9, the decimal point and a "change" character denoted as CH. The BATCO ciphertext character set is the letters A through Z. BATCO can also be used to transmit numeric information, such as grid coordinates. Switching to this mode is accomplished by sending the vocabulary code for an appropriate proword, such as FIGURES or GRID. The decimal point plaintext character is used as needed in numeric mode, having its normal meaning. The CH symbol is used to mark the end of a numeric string transmission, returning to the vocabulary card codes.
The main BATCO cipher table is a matrix of 19 columns and 26 rows. The columns are divided into two groups. The seven left columns are numbered 2 through 7. The column under each digit contains a randomly scrambled alphabet. The right 13 columns are labeled 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, CH , ".", i.e. the plaintext symbols with 0 repeated. Each "row" in the right columns set contains a scrambled alphabet, with two letters in each cell. (There are 13 columns, so two letters per cell exhausts the alphabet.)
A traffic key consist of a digit (from 2 to 7) and a letter. The operator selects one of the first 7 columns using the key digit and then finds the row in which the key letter occurs. That row in the second set of columns is used to encipher and decipher BATCO messages. The scrambled alphabet in the selected row defines the correspondence between plaintext symbols in the column headings and ciphertext symbols in the individual cells. Note that there are two possible ciphertexts for each plaintext symbol, except for 0, which has four possible ciphertexts. BATCO users are instructed to choose different ciphertext symbols when the same plaintext symbol repeats in a message. 
Security is maintained by frequent key changes. BATCO instructions require a new key for every message and that no more than 22 symbols should be encoded with a single key. Keys are rotated in alphabetical order, so key 5F would be followed by 5G. Key column 7 is kept in reserve for emergencies.
Other functions.
In addition to the cipher, each BATCO sheet has a:
The spelling box converts letters into two digit numbers which can then be encoded using the procedure described above. It is used is special situations to spell out words that are sensitive and are not on any of the vocabulary cards. The spelling box is a 6 column by 5 row matrix labeled horizontally and vertically with single digits. The matrix contains a scrambled alphabet and four blank cells.
The authentication table converts a two digit challenge number into a two digit response. It is a 10 by 5 grid, also labeled horizontally and vertically with single digits. Each cell contains a random two digit number, with no repeated cells. A challenge is issued as a two digit number specifying the columns and row that selects a cell in the table. The response is the contents of the cell.

Russell Motor Car Company

The Russell Motor Car Company was an automobile manufacturer in Toronto, Canada that produced cars from 1904 to 1916. The company is considered to have produced Canada's first successful automobile.
In 1903, weakness in the bicycle market prompted Canada Cycle and Motor Co. (C.C.M.), a bicycle manufacturer, to acquire the assets of Canadian Motors Ltd., a failed automobile producer. Tommy Russell (1877-1940), C.C.M.'s new general manager, saw an opportunity to diversify his company's product line.
From 1903 to 1905, C.C.M.'s new automobile division, named Russell Motor Car Company with Russell serving as president, began production of electric-powered two-passenger runabouts. In 1905, the company produced its first "Model A" car with a two-cylinder gasoline engine. A larger "Model B", and a four-cylinder "Model C", arrived in 1906. A 40 horsepower touring car was introduced in 1907, with a more prestigious 50 horsepower model coming in 1908.
The Russell vehicles developed a reputation as well-built and engineered cars, and success allowed Russell to focus on the high-end market. Sales offices were opened in England, Australia and New Zealand. In Canada, Russell promoted its vehicles as "The Thoroughly Canadian Car," built with Canadian material, labour and capital. Marketing included publicity stunts such as races on frozen Lake Ontario between Russell cars and ice-yachts. The Russell Motor Car Company Limited was incorporated separately from C.C.M. in 1911.
The company began to experience difficulties with its sleeve valve engines in 1913. A downturn in the high-end market, coupled with the commencement of the First World War in 1914, resulted in Russell selling its automobile production business to the American manufacturer Willys-Overland Motors in 1916. Russell produced munitions during the war, and manufactured automobile parts after the war ended. In 1938, the company changed its name to Russell Industries Limited, as it continued its shift away from the automobile industry, expanding into the manufacture of machine parts. The company continued to exist into the 1950s.

Bahá'í Faith in Taiwan

The Bahá'í Faith in Taiwan, 巴哈伊教, began after the religion entered areas of China and nearby Japan. The first Bahá'ís arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and the first of these to have become a Bahá'í was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung) in 1945 while visiting the United States. By May 1955 there were eighteen Bahá'ís in six localities across Taiwan. The first Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1967 when there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Circa 2006 the Bahá'ís showed up in the national census with 16,000 members and 13 assemblies.
Early days.
Far East.
The Bahá'í Faith entered the region of the Far East, in Hong Kong, in the 1870s, during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith. While the religion continued to enter other nearby regions to Taiwan — Bahá'ís being in Shanghai in 1902, Japan in 1912, Canton in 1949, and Macau in 1953, there was no Bahá'í contact with the island until 1949. Between 1895 and 1945, until ending with World War II, Taiwan was under Japanese rule and then there was the period of the Chinese Civil War.
Beginning in Taiwan.
Four Bahá'ís arrived in Taiwan in 1949 as part of the wave of refugees of Chiang Kai-Shek's retreat from the mainland: Jerone Chu, Yan Hsu-chang, Chien Tien-lee, and Gellan Wang. The first Bahá'í in Taiwan was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung), a newspaper man, who had become a Bahá'í in Washington D.C. in 1945. Chu arrived in Taiwan after a stay in Nanking where an associate, Yuan Hsu-chang, had accepted the religion and also came to Taiwan. Major Chien Tien-lee (Lee L.T. Chang) had had a Bahá'í marriage ceremony in Denver, Colorado, U.S.A. and came to Taiwan after a stay in Shanghai.
The first American Bahá'í visitors to Taiwan were Dr. David Earl and Lt. Col. John McHenry in 1952, and Rafi and Mildred Mottahedeh in 1953. In October of that year Dhikru'llah Khadem visited Taiwan, the first Hand of the Cause — people who achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion — to do so and at a meeting he held in Chu's home three more people accepted the Bahá'í Faith: these three were Professor Tsao Li-shih, who was an instructor of architecture at the College of Engineering at the National Taiwan University; Hong Li-ming (Jimmy), the first native-born Taiwanese to become a Bahá'í; and Wong Ho-len (Wong Ho-jen).
Later, Mr. and Mrs. Suleimani, who were Bahá'ís in Shanghai, left that city in 1950, and arrived in Taiwan in 1954 at port Keelung where they found there was already a community of ten Bahá'ís spread among some of the cities of Taiwan: Taipei (2), Tainan (4), Tao-yuan, Tsoying and Chiayi. Mrs. Suleimani was from a Bahá'í family from Ashqabad who left in 1923.
Growth.
By May 1955 there were eighteen Bahá'ís in six localities across Taiwan. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956, which was noted by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion. The members were Mr. Wang Chi-chang, Mrs. Suleimani, Mr. Pai Chung-chen, Mrs. Ruthy Tu, Mr. Tsao Li-shih. Standing. Dr. Ni Jun-chung (ching), Mr. Chu, Mr. Winston Luk, and Mr. Ho Chung-tzu. Mrs. Tu was the first woman citizen of Taiwan to become a Bahá'í and was elected to be a delegate in 1957 to the election of the regional National Spiritual Assembly but was unable to travel. Noted Bahá'í Agnes Alexander visited the island in 1956, and, after being appointed as a Hand of the Cause, visited the island again in 1958 and 1962.
From 1955 through 1957, petitions by the Bahá'í community were submitted to the Taiwanese government to be recognized as a religion by the government had failed, though permission was given to have a temporary Bahá'í summer school in Sept. 1957.
In 1957, the first regional National Assembly election convention of the Bahá'ís of North East Asia, held in Tokyo, was convened; the jurisdiction of the National Assembly included Taiwan. In 1958, the second Local Spiritual Assembly of the island was established in Taipei with the arrival of two pioneers and one more citizen convert. By April 1958 the number of Bahá'ís in Taiwan had reached twenty-two. The first official use of the Tainan Bahá'í Centre was in 1959. In 1960 the book Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era was revised, translated and reprinted and one copy was given to every Bahá'í in Taiwan. In 1963 Mrs. Tu was able to attend the first Bahá'í World Congress which also the year of the first Bahá'í marriage ceremony in Taiwan.
The first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of Taiwan was first elected in 1967 — the members of the institution were Mrs. Isabel Dean and Mrs. Ridvaniyyih Suleimani, Mr. Kuo Rong-hui, Mr. Robert Yen, Dr. Sidney Dean, Mr. S.A. Suleimani, Mr. Tsao Kai-min, Mr. Huang Tsen-min and Mr. Huang Ting-seng. At the time there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Then in 1970 the Bahá'í community of the island was recognized by the government.
In 1990, the Chief of the indigenous Puyuma Tribe, Mr. Chen Wen-sheng, became a Bahá'í.
Multiplying interests.
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In more recent years the Bahá'ís of Taiwan have participated in a number of local and international activities. By 1995, the Bahá'í Office of the Environment for Taiwan, in collaboration with the national government, had trained hundreds of teachers throughout the country to introduce conservation issues into curricula. The Office also produced a series of national radio educational programs on environmental care and protection. In December 1997 Bahá'ís were invited to participate in a local exhibit of religions. In 2001 Bahá'ís from Taiwan attended the opening of the Seat of the International Teaching Centre. In 2004, the Taiwanese Baha'i community organizes 20 regular children's classes, attracting some 200 children.
Modern Community.
Circa 2006 the Bahá'ís showed up in the national census with 16,000, or 0.1% of the national population with 13 assemblies. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) agreed with that estimate in 2005.
