World oil market chronology from 2003

From the mid-1980s to September 2003, the inflation adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally under $25/barrel. Then, during 2004, the price rose above $40, and then $50. A series of events led the price to exceed $60 by August 11, 2005, and then briefly exceed $75 in the middle of 2006. Prices then dropped back to $60/barrel by the early part of 2007 before rising steeply again to $92/barrel by October 2007, and $99.29/barrel for December futures in New York on November 21, 2007. Throughout the first half of 2008, oil regularly reached record high prices. On February 29, 2008, oil prices peaked at $103.05 per barrel, and reached $110.20 on March 12, 2008, the sixth record in seven trading days. Prices on June 27, 2008, touched $141.71/barrel, for August delivery in the New York Mercantile Exchange (after the recent $140.56/barrel), amid Libya's threat to cut output, and OPEC's president predicted prices may reach $170 by the Northern summer. The most recent price per barrel maximum of $147.02 was reached on July 11, 2008. After falling below $100 in the late summer of 2008, prices rose again in late September. On September 22, oil rose over $25 to $130 before settling again to $120.92, marking a record one-day gain of $16.37. Electronic crude oil trading was temporarily halted by NYMEX when the daily price rise limit of $10 was reached, but the limit was reset seconds later and trading resumed.
By October 16, prices had fallen again to below $70, and on November 6 oil closed below $60.
As the price of producing petroleum did not rise significantly, the price increases have coincided with a period of record profits for the oil industry. Between 2004 and 2007, the profits of the six supermajors - ExxonMobil, Total, Shell, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips - totaled $494.8 billion.
2003.
United States crude oil prices averaged $30 a barrel in 2003 due to political instability within various oil producing nations.
It rose 19% from the average in 2002. The 2003 invasion of Iraq marked a significant event for oil markets because Iraq contains a large amount of global oil reserves. The conflict coincided with an increase in global demand for petroleum, but it also reduced Iraq's current oil production and has been blamed for increasing oil prices. However, oil company CEO Matthew Simmons emphasizes the peaking and decline of oil-exporting in Mexico, Indonesia and the United Kingdom is the reason for the price gouging. According to Simmons, isolated events, such as the Iraq war, affect short-term prices but do not determine a long-term trend. Simmons cites the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques in large fields such as Mexico's Cantarell, which maintained production for a few years until it eventually declined. Pumping oil out of Iraq may reduce petroleum prices in the short term, but will be unable to perpetually lower the price. From Simmons' point of view, the invasion of Iraq is associated with the start of long-term increase in oil prices, but it may mitigate the decline in oil production by retaining a partial amount of Iraq's oil reserves. As a direct consequence, the oil production capacity was diminished to per day.
2004 to 2008: rising costs of oil.
After retreating for several months in late 2004 and early 2005, crude oil prices rose to new highs in March 2005. The price on NYMEX has been above the $50 per barrel since March 5, 2005. In June 2005, crude oil prices broke the psychological barrier of $60 per barrel. After the destruction of Hurricane Katrina in the United States, gasoline prices reached a record high during the first week of September 2005. The average retail price was, on average, $3.04 per U.S. gallon. The average retail price of a liter of petrol in the United Kingdom was 86.4p on October 19, 2006, or $6.13 per gallon. Oil production in Iraq continued to decline as result of the nation's ongoing conflict causing a decrease in production to .
In mid-2006, crude oil was traded for over USD 79 per barrel (bbl), setting an all-time record. The run-up is attributed to a 1.9 increase in gasoline consumption, geopolitical tensions resulting from North Korea's missile launch. The ongoing Iraq war, as well as Israel and Lebanon going to war are also causative factors.
The higher price of oil substantially cut growth of world oil demand in 2006, including a reduction in oil demand of the OECD. After news of North Korea's successful nuclear test on October 9, 2006, oil prices rose past $60 a barrel, but fell back the next day.
On October 19, 2007, U.S. light crude rose to $90.02 per barrel due to a combination of ongoing tensions in eastern Turkey and the reducing strength of the U.S. dollar. Prices fell briefly on the expectation of increased U.S. crude oil stocks, however they quickly rose to a peak of $92.22 on October 26, 2007.
On January 2, 2008, U.S. light crude surpassed $100 per barrel before falling to $99.69 due to tensions on New Years Day in Nigeria, and on suspicion that U.S. crude stocks will have dropped for the seventh consecutive week. A BBC report from the following day stated a single trader bid up the price; Stephen Schork, a former floor trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the editor of an oil market newsletter, said one floor trader bought , the smallest amount permitted, and immediately sold it for $99.40 at a $600 loss. Oil fell back later in the week to $97.91 at the close of trading on Friday, January 4, in part due to a weak jobs report that showed unemployment had risen.
On March 5, 2008, OPEC accused the United States of economic "mismanagement" that was pushing oil prices to record highs, rebuffing calls to boost output and laying blame at the George W. Bush administration. Oil prices surged above $110 to a new inflation-adjusted record on March 12, 2008 before settling at $109.92. On April 18, 2008 the price of oil broke $117 per barrel after a Nigerian militant group claimed an attack on an oil pipeline. Oil prices rose to a new high of $119.90 a barrel on April 22, 2008, before dipping and then rising $3 on April 25, 2008 to $119.10 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a news report that a ship contracted by the U.S. Military Sealift Command fired at an Iranian boat.
On June 6, prices rose $11 in 24 hours, the largest gain in history due to the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran. The combination of two major oil suppliers reducing supply generated fears of a repeat of the 1973 oil crisis. The mid-July decision of Saudi Arabia to increase oil output caused little significant influence on prices. According to the oil minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Gholam-Hossein Nozari, the world markets were saturated and a Saudi promise of increased production would not lower prices. Several Asian refineries were refusing Saudi petroleum in late June because they were over priced grade.
On July 3, "the Brent North Sea crude contract for August delivery rose to $US145.01 a barrel" in Asian trade. London Brent crude reached a record of $145.75 a barrel, and Brent crude for August delivery peaked to a record $145.11 a barrel on London's ICE Futures Europe exchange, and to $144.44 a barrel on the NYMExchange. By midday in Europe, crude rose to $145.85 a barrel on the NYME while Brent crude futures rose to a trading record of $146.69 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.
2008: oil prices peak and then decline.
On July 15, 2008, a bubble-bursting sell-off began after remarks by President Bush the previous day that the ban on oil drilling would be lifted. This precipitated an $8 drop, the biggest since the first US-Iraq war. By the end of the week, crude oil fell 11% to $128, also affected by easing of tensions between the US and Iran. By August 13, prices had fallen to $113 a barrel. falling below $92 in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
A stronger US dollar and a likely decline in European demand were suggested to be among the causes of the decline. By October 24, the price of crude dropped to $64.15, and closed at $60.77 on November 6.
2009.
In January 2009, oil prices rose temporarily because of tensions in the Gaza Strip. From mid January to February 13, oil fell to near $35 a barrel.
2010.
On May 21, 2010, the price of oil had dropped in two weeks from $88 to $70 mainly due to concerns over how European countries would reduce budget deficits; if the European economy slowed down, this would mean less demand for crude oil. Also, if the European economic crisis caused the American economy to have problems, demand for oil would be reduced further. Other factors included the strong dollar and high inventories. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gas prices nationwide averaged $2.91 on May 10, dropping to $2.79 two weeks later. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was not a factor in gas prices since the well had not produced.
Prices rose back to $90/barrel in December 2010. The US average for a gallon of 87 octane regular unleaded averaged $3.00/gallon on December 23, sparking fear of a second recession if prices reached $100/barrel and $4.00/gallon gasoline, as forecasted for spring 2011. The price increases in December were based on global demand and the Arctic blasts affecting North America and Europe.
2011.
Political turmoil in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Bahrain drove oil prices to $95/barrel in late February 2011. A few days prior, oil prices on the NYMEX closed at $86. Oil prices topped at $103 on February 24 where oil production is curtailed to the political upheaval in Libya.
Oil supplies remained high, and Saudi Arabia assured an increase in production to counteract shutdowns. Still, the Mideast and North African crisis led to a rise in oil prices to the highest level in two years, with gasoline prices following. Though most Libyan oil went to Europe, all oil prices reacted. The average price of gasoline in the United States increased 6 cents to $3.17. On March 1, 2011, a significant drop in Libyan production and fears of more instability in other countries pushed the price of oil over $100 a barrel in New York trading, while the average price of gas reached $3.37. Despite Saudi promises, the sour type oil the country exported could not replace the more desirable sweet Libyan oil. On March 7, 2011, the average price of gas having reached $3.57, individuals were making changes in their driving.
The weakened U.S. Dollar resulted in a spike to $112/barrel with the national average of $3.74/gallon - with expectations of damaging the U.S. economy suggestive of a long-term recession. As of April 26, the national average was $3.87 - with a fear of $4/gallon as the nationwide average prior to the summer driving season.
The national average rose on May 5, 2011 for the 44th straight day, reaching $3.98. However, that same day, West Texas Intermediate crude fell below $100 a barrel, the lowest since March 16. This came after crude oil for June delivery reached $114.83 on May 2, the highest since September 2008, before closing at $97.18 on May 6, a day after dropping 9 percent, the most dramatic single-day drop in over two years. Gas prices fell slightly on May 6, and experts predicted $3.50 a gallon by summer.
In mid-June, West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery fell nearly $2 to $93.01, the lowest price since February. The dollar was up and the euro and other currencies down, and the European economic crisis made investors concerned. London Brent crude fell 81 cents to $113.21. On June 15 the Energy Information Association said oil consumption was down 3.5 percent from a year earlier, but wholesale gasoline demand was up for the first time in several weeks. The price of gas on June 17 was $3.67.5 a gallon, 25.1 cents lower than a month earlier but 96.8 cents above a year earlier. On June 24, the price of gas was $3.62.8 and expected to go much lower due to the opening of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. U.S. oil prices fell below $90 before rising again, and Brent crude fell two percent. However, on June 29, West Texas intermediate crude had risen to $94.96, almost $5 above the lowest point reached after the previous week's action. One reason was the falling dollar, as Greece appeared less likely to default on its debt; concern over the Greek debt crisis had caused falling oil prices. After another week, oil for August delivery had risen from $90.61 to $98.67 and gas prices were up five cents. Increased worldwide demand was one reason. Brent Crude remained high at $118.38 partly due to supply problems in Europe, including lower North Sea production and the continuing war in Libya.
On August 4, the price of oil dropped 6 percent to its lowest level in 6 months. On August 5, the price had dropped $8.82 in a week to $86.88 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The same pessimistic economic news that caused stock prices to fall also decreased expected energy demand, and experts predicted a gas price drop of 35 cents per gallon from the average of $3.70. On August 8, oil fell over 6 percent, in its largest drop since May, to $81, its lowest price of the year. On September 24, oil reached $79.85, down 9 percent for the week, due to concerns about another recession and the overall world economy. The average price of gas was $3.51, with predictions of $3.25 by November, but it was below $3 in some markets.
During October, the price of oil rose 22 percent, the fastest pace since February, as worries over the U.S. economy decreased, leading to predictions of $4 by early 2012. As of November 8, the price reached $96.80. Gas prices were not following the increase, due to lower demand resulting from the economy, the normal decrease in travel, lower oil prices in other countries, and production of winter blends which cost less. The average rose slightly to $3.41 but predictions of $3.25 were made.
2012.
Shortages of oil could have resulted if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of exported oil travels, as a result of sanctions due to the country's nuclear policies. The price of oil stayed near $100 throughout January because of concerns over supplies, and the European debt situation. The average price of gas was $3.38 on January 20, up 17 cents from a month earlier. Another factor was planned closing of refineries in the U.S. and Europe due to lower demand. By early February, the national average was $3.48, though oil prices were at $98, the lowest in six weeks, and U.S. demand was the lowest since September 2001. On February 20, benchmark March crude oil reached $105.21, the highest in nine months. This came one day after Iran's oil ministry announced an end to sales to British and French companies; though this would have little actual impact on supplies, fears resulted in higher prices. Also, approval of the bailout plan for Greece was expected, and China's action to raise the money supply was likely to stimulate the economy. Brent crude was up 11 percent for the year to $119.58 on February 17, with cold weather in Europe and higher Third World demand, and West Texas Intermediate crude was up 19 percent to $103.24. The average price of gas was $3.53. On February 29, the average was $3.73. The average peaked at $3.94 early in April, and on April 24, it was $3.85 compared to $3.86 a year earlier; it had been two years since gas prices were lower than the previous year. Crude oil prices were down; West Texas Intermediate was $103.55 a barrel, down from over $107 late in March, and Brent Crude $118.16 after peaking above $128 in March. On May 7, benchmark U.S. crude reached $95.34, the lowest price of the year, after voters in France and Greece ousted government officials who would cut spending to solve the debt crisis. Benchmark oil in New York actually rose for two days straight early in June, to $84.29. With U.S. oil supplies the highest since 1990, gas reached $3.57 on June 5. After falling again to its lowest price since October 2011, Benchmark crude rose 5.8 percent to $82.18 on June 29, with Brent crude up 4.5 percent to $95.51. European bailout efforts included lending money to banks, decreasing likelihood of failures. Also, European countries decided not to buy Iranian oil. The price of gas was $3.35, the lowest since January 6. On July 17, Benchmark Crude reached $89.22 and Brent crude $104 after good economic news in the United States. Gas rose to $3.40.
On August 7, a California refinery fire contributed to a jump in oil futures. Other refinery problems, a pipeline leak, fears about Iran, the crisis in Syria, North Sea problems, and Tropical Storm Ernesto all contributed to a 20 percent jump in oil prices in six weeks. The price of gas reached $3.63 but was not expected to go much higher. Good economic news in the United States contributed to oil reaching its highest price since May on August 17, with Benchmark Crude reaching $96.01, while Brent crude fell slightly to $113.71.
Early in September, a mix of bad economic news from the United States and good economic news from Europe caused the price of oil to fall slightly. On September 4, Benchmark Crude reached $95.41, with Brent crude at $114.84. The price of gas went down slightly to $3.82 but was still the highest ever for Labor Day weekend. Hurricane Isaac contributed to a temporary spike in gas prices, but on September 12 gas once again rose, to $3.86, as refineries cut production prior to the switch from summer blend gasoline to winter blend. Benchmark Crude also reached its highest level since early May and continued to rise above $99 after Federal Reserve announcements of actions to improve the economy and the 2012 diplomatic missions attacks. Brent crude rose slightly to nearly $116. Early in October, the average gas price was $3.78 and falling, though still a record for the month. Late in the month, the average reached $3.62 after a 13-cent drop in a week, the most since November 2008. Brent crude was down $8 in the previous month. By the start of November, the average was $3.54, partly due to lower demand after Hurricane Sandy. Crude oil futures fell after Barack Obama was re-elected November 6. After Thanksgiving, lower U.S. oil inventories, good economic news in the United States and good news relating to the Greek bailout helped push Brent crude up to $111.04, and benchmark oil for January delivery to $87.92; benchmark oil reached $86.24 on November 28, and gas was $3.41.
On December 13, Brent crude was down to $109.20, while benchmark oil fell slightly due to U.S. fiscal cliff concerns and rose due to Federal Reserve efforts to help the U.S. economy, ending the day at $86.77. In mid-December, gas prices reached $3.25, the lowest for 2012. Oil was trading for between $84 and $90.
2013.
On January 17, with good economic news in the United States, Benchmark oil reached its highest level since September, going over $95. Brent crude rose above $110. Gas was at $3.29.
Refinery shutdowns led to a dramatic rise in gas prices. Late in February, gas was at $3.78, up 14 cents from a week earlier. On February 25, with European stock markets doing well, Benchmark crude for April rose above $94 after a significant drop the previous week due to news the Federal Reserve might end its stimulus efforts, making the dollar stronger. Brent crude was over $115. Two days later gas reached its highest point, $3.79 a gallon. By mid-April, with low demand expected due to negative economic news, gas was down to $3.56 as Brent crude fell to $103.04, its lowest price since July. With economic problems worldwide leading to low demand, gas prices fell 3 percent in April, the most in a month in ten years, to the lowest level for that month since 2010.
Before Memorial Day, gas supplies fell even though oil supplies were the highest in 35 years. U.S. economic news was also negative. On May 30, Benchmark crude for July rose slightly to $93.61 after falling the previous day, and Brent crude fell slightly to $102.19. On June 5 the price of oil rose again with supplies lower. Benchmark crude rose above $94. The price of gas was $3.62. On June 12, the International Energy Agency said demand for oil would still rise in 2013, but not as much as previously believed due to the economy. Also, May OPEC production was the highest in seven months. Benchmark crude fell slightly to $95.31, and Brent crude rose to $103.27. On June 20, with the Federal Reserve stating that its stimulus program could end if the U.S. economy continued to improve, as well as economic problems in China, Benchmark crude fell below $97. Brent crude fell to $104.24.
On July 10, oil prices were the highest in more than a year as a result of lower supplies and trouble in Egypt. In the past week, Brent crude had climbed 7 percent to $108.51. Because too much oil was being produced for the infrastructure to handle it, West Texas Intermediate was lower than Brent crude for several years; it has returned to being consistent with Brent. On July 5 it reached $103.22. On July 19 with good economic news in the United States, Benchmark crude reached $108.05, while gas was $3.67, the highest on a Friday since March 22. Brent crude was at $108.07. Gas was $3.63 on August 1, though good economic news in the U.S., China and Europe meant oil was going up again after a decline the previous week. Benchmark crude reached $107.89, while Brent crude was $109.54. On August 16 Benchmark oil was $107.46 after six days of increases as Egypt's problems continued. The concern was access to the Suez Canal, which appears unlikely to be a problem but still concerns companies. Brent crude was $110.48 on August 19. On August 28 West Texas intermediate reached $110.10, the highest since May 2011, and Brent crude reached $116.61, its highest point since February 19, due to concern about U.S. involvement in Syria. Meanwhile, inventories in the United States had their biggest increase in four months. Benchmark crude rose to $107.56 on September 11 due to lower supplies after dropping due to hopes for a peaceful Syria solution; Brent crude rose to $111.50.
Gas was $3.59 at the start of the month, but at the end of September, the price of gas was $3.39, the lowest for the time of year since 2010. The New York Mercantile Exchange price on September 27 was $102.87. Refineries had no hurricanes or other problems. Benchmark crude fell to $103.31 on October 3 after the U.S. government shutdown, and Brent crude was $109. On October 21, Benchmark crude was $99.22, the first time below $100 since July. Higher supplies and fewer threats from the Middle East were the reasons. Brent crude was $109.64 and gas reached $3.35. On November 13, Brent crude reached $107.12 and was $13.24 higher than West Texas Intermediate, the largest difference since April, due to trouble in Libya and sanctions against Iran. On November 25, Benchmark crude decreased to $93.92 while Brent crude reached $110.41 after the agreement regarding Iran's nuclear program. On December 16, Benchmark crude rose to $97.44 and Brent crude reached $110.53 with good economic news from Europe and more Libya trouble. Gas was $3.23, three cents higher than a month earlier. On December 27, due to a better economy in the United States leading to higher demand, oil closed about $100 for the first time since October. Gas was $3.27, two cents below a year earlier.
2014.
On January 2, Benchmark crude fell by the most in one day since November 2012 to close at $95.44. Brent crude was $107.78. Gas was $3.33. With the Iran agreement and increased production from Libya and the North Sea, Benchmark oil was around $92 on January 13 and Brent crude was $105.98. After good economic news from Japan, Benchmark crude fell slightly from its highest close of 2014, $98.23 on January 30. Brent crude fell to $107.25. The difference between the two fell below $10 for the first time since November, partly due to cold weather in the United States which resulted in high heating oil demand. This led to the price staying above $100 for most of February, but lower prices were expected. With United States fourth quarter economic growth expected to be lower than an early estimate, Benchmark crude fell slightly on February 27 to $102.40, with Brent crude reaching $108.61.

Folio Corporation

Folio Corporation was founded in 1987 by Curt Allen and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. It quickly gained recognition for helping other companies to publish content on local area networks and on digital CD-ROMs for use on desktop computers. Allen and Pelo were both students at BYU; Allen was in mechanical engineering and Pelo was in public policy. During the 1986 summer break, they began working on a computer program that would index, compress, and continually update text information. Success came in 1988 when Novell agreed to provide a read-only version of Folio's software with every NetWare operating system that Novell shipped.
History.
The first product, NFolio 1.2, was shipped in September 1988 as part of Novell NetWare. Users typing "help" at any DOS prompt on a Novell network were presented with the online NetWare manuals in Folio Infobase format. Over the years, Folio continued to spread as part of Novell's NetWare, to an estimated 25 million desktops.
NFolio allowed users to view information received from multiple sources, add personal notes to that information, and create a personal "infobase" (information database) that could be shared and easily used by others. NFolio also allowed fast indexing using a feature that automatically indexed every word in an infobase. With the release of version 2 of NFolio in March 1989, NFolio was renamed to Folio Views 1.0.
In March 1990, Folio released Folio Views 1.3 with a new feature named Folio Legal Views that allowed creation and indexing of legal dispositions and other legal documents, using what was called DepoPrep.
In July 1990, Folio released Folio Views 2.0 with 100 new features, including new types of hypertext links, "hyperlinks", within a single document and across several documents, and links to external applications, graphics, sounds, and animation.
It was in 1990 that Paul Allen and Dan Taggart, two graduates of BYU, created Infobases, Inc., and began offering LDS church publications on computer floppy disks. They chose to use Folio Views as their infobase indexing and presentation technology, since Allen was familiar with it, having worked at Folio Corporation since that company's founding in 1987. Folio was co-founded by Paul Allen's brother Curt Allen, and by his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Using Folio technology seemed a natural way to offer LDS publications as a business venture.
In March 1991, Folio released MailBag, an infobase application that stored and retrieved electronic mail messages on a Novell LAN.
Folio Views 2.1 was released in June 1991. Included was Folio Views Personal Edition, which allowed users to search, annotate, edit, group, link and output information on their personal computers. This was the company's first MS-DOS program.
"The Electronic Labyrinth" described Folio Views 2.1 as follows: "a document indexing and retrieval package for DOS text mode. In the terminology of this software nodes are folios and collections of folios are infobases. An infobase consists of the original text plus full text indexing. The total file size is about half that of the original text, due to some clever file compression. Folio refers to this as "underhead" technology. The searching facility is powerful, supporting Booleans, wildcards, and proximity criteria. Reference links may be made to other folios, external programs, PCX graphics, or audio files in RealSound format. Nodes may be grouped in clusters to facilitate organization and comparisons between groups. Text editing features include block operations and highlighting. Over forty file formats may be imported; 2GB of text may be stored in all. The interface is based on a window paradigm and supports a mouse. On-line help is available. Folio Views is priced at $695. A personal edition, which has full functionality but cannot create new infobases, is $295. The runtime module allows read-only access. An unlimited not-for-profit license is $1995." As of 2000, all Folio DOS programs had been retired.
Sale to Mead Data Central (LEXIS-NEXIS).
On December 31, 1992, Mead Data Central, Inc., provider of the LEXIS and NEXIS computer services, purchased Folio Corporation. Included in the description of the sale was that Folio software was being used by more than 80 commercial publishers in creating and distributing electronic versions of thousands of popular printed works, principally on compact disks and magnetic media. The market leader was Lotus Notes, and Mead Data Central, with annual revenues of $469.5 million, was well placed to compete. LEXIS-NEXIS was sold to Reed Elsevier Group in December 1994.
In May 1993, Folio Corporation released Folio Views 3.0.
When Folio Corporation announced a planned move to a new location in the RiverWoods Research and Business Park in north Provo, the company stated that it had 104 employees, twice the number of a year before. Product sales doubled with the release of Folio Views 3.0.
Folio's rapid rise was seen in an October 1995 news release about an expanded relationship between Folio Corporation and Novell, increasing the use of Folio products as part of Novell's NetWare Directory Services. Folio stated that its "infobase publishing platform is rapidly becoming a standard for professional and business content providers in industries such as legal, accounting, tax, medical, pharmaceutical, and insurance." Folio added that they had as their customer base, nearly 600 commercial publishers, and that they were "the world's leading provider of infobase software with its products installed on an estimated 30 million desktops."
In June 1996 Folio released Web Retriever 2.0, to import web content into infobase indexed documents. As its technology continued to improve, Folio's Web Retriever later became known Folio SiteDirector, then Folio LivePublish, then NextPage NXT.
In September 1996 Folio Corporation released Folio 4, replacing the latest version of Folio Bound Views, 3.11.2.
Folio Builder was for building the infobases at the core of Folio 4. Folio Builder indexed and compiled ASCII, Word, WordPerfect, FrameMaker, and Folio flat files into an infobase and provides a developer with encryption, compression, and security options. Folio Builder was previously called the Infobase Production Kit. The Folio product line included Folio SiteDirector, Folio Views, Folio Builder, Folio Publisher, Folio Integrator, Folio 4, LivePublish and SecurePublish.
Sale To Open Market.
In March 1997, after less than five years as part of Mead Data Central and LexisNexis, including less than three years as part of Reed Elsevier Group, which had purchased LexisNexis in December 1994, Folio Corporation was sold to Open Market, an internet company based in Massachusetts. Open Market was seeking to take advantage of the growing electronic commerce phenomena taking place on the World Wide Web. Open Market intended to use Folio's technology to enter the electronic commerce market to sell products via the internet. Folio's business of creating and retrieving, and cross-linking multimedia databases "never seemed to gel" with its parent company's LexisNexis database.
Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million. Two weeks before, Open Market had purchased WayPoint, a business solution designed to create Internet-based business-to-business catalogs by retrieving complex product information from databases. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Open Market retained Folio's 190 employees at Folio's Provo, Utah, headquarters. Folio was to operate as a division of Open Market under Folio president Bill Bennett. Open Market would combine Folio's document management software with its own e-commerce transaction management package (OM-Transact) to provide new products for companies selling information-based services. The merger was to result in products that combined Open Market's server-based "back-end" transaction management and security technologies with Folio's server-based "front-end" information databases and search-retrieval software. Products featuring the combined technologies were expected by the end of June 1997.
In an industry-wide review of network-based internal search engines, "Network Computing" magazine ranked Folio SiteDirector 3.1 number 8 of the 10 products it reviewed, saying, "Folio's siteDirector is a completely different approach to providing a searchable index of a Web site, quite unlike the other search engines we tested. In fact, SiteDirector assumes you've rendered the contents of your Web site as an infobase--Folio's term for its searchable, multilinked, compressed repository of text and graphics. SiteDirector serves up the infobase contents as HTML and lets you search the infobase." This was in the days before the emphasis on more recent World Wide Web standards, and this review made comment about the specialized HTML tags used by Folio. To test the software's function, the testers "used Folio's supplied HTML templates (called SoftPages) to create HTML pages laced with infobase-specific HTML tags, editing those pages with the customized version of the HomeSite HTML page authoring software that Folio bundles with SiteDirector. The special HTML tags let SiteDirector deliver specific infobase documents or elements when called for by the Web page."
"Infobase files store text, word processor documents, and multimedia data in a highly compressed format that includes a full index of the file's contents. The SiteDirector server instantly converts infobase files to HTML format when a browser requests a Web page. SiteDirector's search engine lets users search all the text in a multi-gigabyte infobase file in less than a second."
Newspapers were realizing that they had potential revenue in their archives. One of the users was the Salt Lake City Tribune, which used SiteDirector to sell access to their archives, stored in Folio's infobase file format.
In February 1998, Open Market announced that Folio would make use of the new standards XML for content, and XSL for style.
Folio had its roots in local area networks, "intranets", and CD-ROM publishing. Open Market found Folio's technology difficult to integrate into its own technology for ecommerce web sites and web content management. In a later bankruptcy court hearing, one of the statements showed that "Folio was more designed for multimedia distribution. It was not really focused on the Web. Making a conversion of that product over to the Web was actually going to be more costly than thought".
Folio 4.2 was released by Open Market in October 1998. At the same time, Open Market released LivePublish to replace the earlier Folio SiteDirector. (A SiteDirector license was priced at $4,995) SiteDirector was developed as a way for companies to publish information previously available only in LAN-based versions of Folio's software. Several companies that use Folio's products internally were adding SiteDirector to sell access to their private repositories on the Web.
In mid-1998, Open Market licensed Folio technology to ITM Products for that company's new Fusion technology to bridge between Lotus Notes databases to Folio infobases. (The Fusion product sold for about $15,000 for a 300-seat license.)
"Open Market's first quarter 1999 revenue of $12.6 million for its e-commerce products grew 116 percent over the same period of the previous year. Folio product sales tallied only $3 million for the same quarter."
Although still the number one seller of consumer e-commerce software, Open Market's share of its market fell from 31 percent in 1997, to 22 percent in 1998. It main competitor, BroadVision, was consistently gaining customers in the explosive $580 million e-commerce market. Open Market started out badly by focusing on large complex systems for large companies such as AT&T and Time Warner, building online shopping malls based on its $1 million software service contracts. The competition was focusing on smaller simple products aimed at individual businesses, and being able to respond to customer's rapid changing needs.
Open Market struggled to integrate the Folio technology into its business model, and together with a growing sense of reality among investors and businesses of high tech internet-related stocks, the company was soon seeing serious decline in its fortunes. A change in management at Open Market, and a switch in technologies in mid-1999 saw the Folio technology licensed back to Pelo and a group of Utah investors that included Alan Ashton of WordPerfect fame, under the name of ABSB.
Folio licensed to NextPage.
In an agreement that took effect on July 1, 1999, Open Market ceased to sell Folio's products and instead licensed them to a new company known as NextPage; NextPage was led by Brad Pelo, a co-founder of the original Folio Corporation. From 1993–1995, Pelo was head of business development for LEXIS/NEXIS, and from 1995 to 1999, he was president of publisher Bookcraft, Inc. Pelo left Bookcraft in 1999 when the company was purchased by Deseret Management Corporation, parent company of its competitor Deseret Book. Pelo formed NextPage along with three other private investors, including Alan Ashton, one of the founders of WordPerfect.
NextPage and Open Market completed an agreement giving NextPage exclusive rights to the future development, marketing, sales and support of Open Market's Folio product line. All of Open Market's Folio-related contracts, partnerships and licenses were transferred to NextPage. In addition, nearly all of Open Market's 90 Folio employees were retained to work in the new company that was to be headquartered in Provo, Utah.
Under the terms of the deal, NextPage, which was known as ABSB L.C. in the initial June 9, 1999 marketing agreement, would resell the Folio products exclusively for a three-year period. NextPage would also have non-exclusive rights to resell Open Market's non-Folio commerce products. Open Market was to receive guaranteed royalties of $14 million for the Folio products, and another $14 million in license fees for its commerce tools. The sale of Folio would allow Open Market to focus on its Internet commerce products, which were to combine order processing and secure payment collection. NextPage registered itself with the State of Utah as a private company on June 8, 1999. At the same time, NextPage registered the Folio.com name.
For two years, Open Market had hoped that adding Folio to its product line for electronic publishers would bring success as those publishers migrated from CD-ROMs to web-based applications on the Internet. The spin-off to NextPage (ABSB) cut 90 employees from Open Market's payroll, an additional 25 percent in addition to 20 percent cut just before Folio was spun-off. Wall Street investors responded to the announcement by Open Market's stock closing up 5 percent. The spin off was for a license and guaranteed license fee, with a final sale to take place at the end of the three-year license period.
Open Market was quick to separate itself from Folio, and to distinguish its recent acquisition FutureTense. Where Folio was well-suited to delivering large collections of reference material, Open Market took a different course, using FutureTense technology which was better suited for the ecommerce business that Open Market had decided to focus on, rather than the document management technology that Folio was focused on. Open Market had purchased at least two other content management providers, and absorb their technologies, but was never able to fully recover. FutureTense failed to save Open Market as a company, and they declared bankruptcy in March (or August) 2003. In 2004 FutureTense, and associated Open Market technologies were part of FatWire Software Corporation, owners of UpdateEngine, a Java-based content management solution.
NextPage soon embarked on an expanding effort to leverage the benefits of Folio technology into what was variously called Peer-To-Peer Content Networking and eContent Platform. A description of Folio included its ability to index all sorts of documents on a company's internal network, known as an intranet, and make those documents readily available to all users on the network, either local or remote.
NextPage continued to improve on the Folio technology. Within less than two years, the technology was being successfully marketed as NextPage's NXT. In January 2000 NextPage purchased Texas-based Complete Data Systems, and in January 2001 NextPage announced that it would purchase netLens, Inc., of Cupertino, CA. Incorporating netLens' PeerSpace technology would allow NextPage to connect its networks with users' mobile devices.
By September 2000, NextPage was about to release NXT 3, the next generation of its Folio suite of products.
NextPage CEO Brad Pelo give testimony before a committee of the U.S. Senate in Provo, UT on October 9, 2000 on the advantages of NextPage's Folio server-based peer-to-peer document management, in a hearing about the future of the Internet, and on the negative impact of Napster, a similar peer-to-peer technology that allowed users to share music across the internet. Also at the hearing was Shawn Fanning, creator of the Napster peer-to-peer network.
NextPage, Inc. moved into its new headquarters at Thanksgiving Point in October 2000. An inauguration ceremony was held on October 16, 2000, attended by 300 guests, including Pelo, Ashton, and Utah Governor Mike Leavitt. At the same time, the company released its NXT 3 product line. NextPage technology was promoted as eliminating traditional barriers of both internal and external networks by providing users single point access to information that may be located on several different local servers or remote servers located in other countries. Their promotional literature stated that once these sources were linked together in a secure "Peer-to-Peer Content Network," they became a single, virtual repository.
Folio products would not be upgraded or improved, just supported with bug fixes (as of mid-2008, they were up to Folio 4.7). All development activities would be pointed to NextPage LivePublish, now known as NextPage NXT, which indexed Word, HTML, XML, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF, and Folio 4.x infobase formatted documents. The next release of LivePublish was in its 6.0 version, but with a new name: NextPage LivePublish 2.0. With its upcoming release, Folio LivePublish 5.0 was informally renamed as NextPage LivePublish 1.0, and in September 2000, NextPage LivePublish 2.0 was replaced by LivePublish 3.0, but renamed to NextPage NXT 3, using the same technology. (At its launch in January 2001, NXT 3 was priced at $85,000 for 250 users.)
Sale to NextPage.
Folio was sold to NextPage on March 23, 2001, for the stated amount of $6.6 million. Open Market had licensed, with an option to purchase, the Folio technology to NextPage in July 1999. Included in the March 2001 sale was the building and facilities, which NextPage had only leased from Open Market after the initial deal in 1999.
In October 2001, NextPage released an upgrade to the NXT suite of products that allowed peer-to-peer collaboration over a customer's secure network. The price of the package for 250 users was stated as being $85,000. Another upgrade in April 2002, called NextPage Solo, allowed customers all of the advantages of their secure peer-to-peer secure network, by way local desktop computers or compact disks, for times that a user is not connected to a network.
In April 2003, NextPage moved its headquarters from Lehi to Draper, Utah.
Sale to FAST.
On September 1, 2004 NextPage, announced that Fast Search & Transfer (FAST), a Norwegian-based developer of enterprise search and real-time alerting technologies, had agreed to purchase the technology, product lines, and the over 500 customers and partners of NextPage's publishing applications business unit, including NXT, Folio, LivePublish, and GetSmart. NextPage's document management services, known as Project Chrome, was to remain with the company.
NextPage received $6 million in cash, and was eligible to receive performance-based payments up to a maximum of $9 million over four years.
FAST had been a VAR of Folio products since 1991.
In January 2006, FAST announced the release of ProPublish 4.1. The relationship of the old Folio format to this newer ProPublish format is not known, but the news release showed that ProPublish included "Enhanced support for Folio and NXT content types."
In 2007 FAST released Folio Views, Folio Builder, Folio Publisher, and Folio Integrator 4.7.1 shortly before Microsoft acquired FAST.
Sale to Microsoft.
On April 25, 2008, Microsoft completed its acquisition of FAST.
Sale to Rocket Software.
On December 2, 2009, Rocket Software, based in Newton, Massachusetts, acquired Folio and NXT from Microsoft.
Rocket Software is a software development firm that builds and services Enterprise Infrastructure products in the areas of database, business intelligence, storage, networks and telecom, terminal emulation and FTP, integration, modernization and SOA, and security.
On February 10, 2010, Rocket Software released Folio Views, Folio Builder, Folio Publisher, and Folio Integrator version 4.7.2, the first release of Folio to officially support Windows Vista and Windows 7 32/64-bit.

Amy (1997 film)

Amy is a 1997 Australian film written by David Parker and directed by Nadia Tass, starring Alana De Roma in the title role, Rachel Griffiths, Ben Mendelsohn, and Nick Barker.
Background.
The story developed from a concept inspired by the "Man of La Mancha" and the screenplay was developed by Tass' husband David Parker. The project that took eleven years to complete due to financial problems and a difficult search for the perfect "Amy".
Plot.
Amy's (Alana De Roma) father, Will Enker (Nick Barker), was a popular rock musician accidentally electrocuted while performing on stage. The psychological trauma leaves Amy mute and deaf. So the 8-year-old is brought by her mother, Tanya (Rachel Griffiths), to Melbourne to diagnose the reasons for her continued silence. Amy befriends her neighbor, Robert(Ben Mendelsohn), and while social workers try desperately to get her to speak and go to school, she makes the choice to communicate again and begins to sing along to Robert's rock songs after three years of silence. Her mother works out her own emotional issues with the help of a therapist.
Release.
The film first screened at the Athens International Film Festival on 12 September 1997, and had its Australian premiere 27 August 1998. It was screened at multiple film festivals from 1998 through 2003, before its television debut in Italy on 14 October 2004.
Reception.
When it was released, it received rave reviews and many awards and nominations. But the film also received criticism as the film was sometimes felt to be dated and imprecise in its references to Amy's plight, however, in France and the U.S, the movie was a hit, apparently receiving standing ovations at some theatres. The film received approval from Lawrence van Gelder of the "New York Times" when he offered that "A couple of good performances, linked to a crowd-pleasing but predictable story marred by some slapdash construction await audiences..." and "Warm of heart, modest in polish, 'Amy' provides satisfactions that must be balanced against its flaws." The "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" was less forgiving when they opined that "although the film is a decidedly mixed bag, it's blessed by solid performances from a top-notch cast", that it "feels dated and imprecise", and is "not able to make up its mind whether it wants to be slapstick or a heart-wrenching drama."
When the film won the Prix de la Jeunesse at the 1999 Cannes International Film Festival, it also won the Le Prix Cinecole, an award judged by teachers from across France, which award was presented by the French Minister for Education and Culture. It was announced that "Amy" will now be included in the senior high school curriculum in France.
Box Office.
"Amy" took $599,724 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $883,616 in 2009 dollars.

Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus (THEARC)

Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus (THEARC ) is a , combined cultural and social services campus in Washington, DC’s Ward 8. The campus, located at 1901 Mississippi Avenue, SE, consists of three connected buildings, playgrounds, basketball courts, and public space. In May 2007 THEARC won the Urban Land Institute's Award for Excellence [http://www.uli.org/] and was cited for its contribution to the community, response to societal needs, innovation, public/private partnership, and environmental protection and enhancement.
Development.
• Built by Building Bridges Across the River (BBAR) for $27 million on east of the Anacostia River in Washington, DC’s Ward 8 Anacostia. BBAR is a nonprofit organization founded by William C. Smith & Co. [http://www.williamcsmith.com/ and formed to develop, construct and manage THEARC. 
• Funding for building THEARC came entirely from charitable contributions by the Federal and District government, corporations, foundations and individuals. The Federal government has leased the land to BBAR for 99 years. 
• THEARC is a key part of a revitalization of the area known as “East of the (Anacostia) River” in Washington, DC. 
• THEARC provides underserved children and families of East of the River dance classes, music instruction, fine arts, academics, recreation and other programs, including social services, mentoring, after school care and case management, as well as medical and dental care at substantially reduced cost or no cost at all. 
• THEARC features a 365-seat Theater, a regulation size gymnasium, a computer lab, an art gallery, a library, a community conference center, state-of-the-art music, art and dance studios and other first-rate facilities. 
Since its official opening, THEARC has served thousands of residents of the surrounding Southeast DC Community and has spurred community redevelopment. The state-of-the-art theater at THEARC is steadily booked for events such as community movie days & sing-alongs, art shows, graduations, professional and community dance and stage productions, concerts, master classes, fashion shows and meetings of community organizations including local public school administrators.
Community Facilities Inside THEARC.
THEARC Theater.
The only theater of any kind located east of the Anacostia River in Washington, DC, this 365-seat venue features a generous stage and professionally designed and installed sound and lighting systems that complement a full variety of productions. THEARC Theater's mission is to be an outstanding venue and vehicle for both cultural events and town hall meetings.
THEARC Community Meeting Room (CMR).
THEARC CMR provides a resource for meetings, conferences, seminars and other community gatherings and presentations, offering wireless Internet service, a hardwire Internet port, a projector and screen, table and chair set up and an adjoining kitchen. The room is available for lease at very reasonable prices.
Living History at THEARC Frederick Douglass Program.
Frederick Douglass, the internationally acclaimed abolitionist, orator and statesman, made his home in Washington, DC's Ward 8 for nearly 20 years. To honor his legacy, a lifelike animatron, set in an exact replica of Douglass' study in his Anacostia home was created for THEARC and is available to the community. More than two hours of Douglass' famous speeches were recorded in varying lengths and complexity and programmed with coordinated body movements into the animatron. Appropriate for all ages, Douglass is also programmed to answer questions from the audience.
Serving THEARC’s Community.
The children living east of the Anacostia River – in DC’s Wards 7 & 8 – comprise 42 percent of Washington, DC’s child population, although the area represents only 25 percent of the total population of DC. In Ward 8, almost half (47%) of these children live in poverty. In fact, DC has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any jurisdiction in the U.S. 
Two thirds (68%) of the area’s homes in Ward 8 are headed by single parents. Neighborhoods with high-poverty concentrations like Ward 8 face significant challenges: problems of poor education, discrimination, unemployment, single parenthood and crime all reinforce one another and undermine the well-being of families and children.

American Sportsman's Library

The American Sportsman's Library is an early and important series of 16 uniformly-bound volumes on sporting subjects, from an American perspective, published by the Macmillan Company (see Macmillan Publishers) in the period 1902-1905. Caspar Whitney, the owner/editor of Outing (magazine) and a well-known outdoorsman and sporting journalist, edited the series. Authors, including Theodore Roosevelt (writing while President of the United States), were noted experts in their fields. 
M.L. Biscotti, in "American Sporting Book Series" (1994), states that "he authors of these titles were a Who's Who of American sportsmen of the era...Macmillan designed a premium series...The sixteen titles produced in this series represent that era's best sporting literature."
The trade edition of each volume was 7⅞" by 5½" with green cloth covers with gilt titles and decorations. The books cost $2 or $3 each, relatively high prices for the time (about $51 and $77 inflation-adjusted to 2009). They included extensive black-and-white illustrations from paintings or photographs. Macmillan also issued a "large paper" edition limited to one hundred numbered copies of each work. These were 9" x 6¼" and bound in three-quarter olive green (typically now faded to brown) leather. They cost $7.50 in 1902 (about $193 inflation-adjusted to 2009). A 1924 reprinting of the trade edition introduced dust jackets and a slightly reduced size (7½" x 5"). 
Macmillan advertised advance notice of, but ultimately did not publish, four additional volumes. These include "Skating, Hockey, and Kite Sailing;" "Baseball and Football;" "The Bear Family;" and "Cougar, Wildcat, Wolf, and Fox".
A useful series for comparison purposes is the slightly earlier British Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes. The Derrydale Press published a series of high-quality American sporting books in the late 1920s and 1930s that, to some extent, supplanted the American Sportsman's Library. 
Whitney testified in a lawsuit against him that he earned a salary of $1,500 (about $39,000 inflation-adjusted to 2009) for editing the American Sportsman's Library.

Departure from Indian Television.
After the 2008 Mumbai Attacks some news channels and blogs reported that Shakeel was beaten and forced to leave India by Hindu religious extremists. However, he later denied being beaten or abused and claimed that the producers of Sony were threatened by the members of MNS of "dire consequences" if they continue to allow Pakistanis to perform on their shows. As a safety precaution, the producers and the artist agreed to have him depart from the country. This claim coincides with later reports. He has made several appearances on Indian TV shows since then.

Chip Kelly

Charles "Chip" Kelly (born November 25, 1963) is an American football coach. He is currently the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and the former head coach at the University of Oregon. During his four seasons at Oregon, he led the team to three Pac-12 Conference championships and four BCS game appearances.
Early life and education.
Kelly was born in Dover, New Hampshire and attended Manchester Central High School and earned his Bachelor of Science in physical education from the University of New Hampshire in 1990. He played quarterback at Manchester Central and defensive back at the University of New Hampshire. Additionally, he played ice hockey and basketball during his high school years.
Coaching career.
Early coaching years.
He broke into the coaching ranks in 1990 at Columbia University, where he served as secondary and special teams coach for the freshman team. The next year he was outside linebackers and strong safeties coach for the varsity team. In 1992 he went to the University of New Hampshire as the running backs coach. He left to become the defensive coordinator at Johns Hopkins University for one season. He returned to his alma mater as the running backs coach for the next three seasons (1994–96). He changed to the offensive line coach for two seasons (1997–98).
Kelly was promoted to offensive coordinator at New Hampshire (1999–2006). The Wildcats' offenses averaged better than 400 yards per game of total offense in seven of his eight seasons and more than 30 points per game in his final four seasons.
In 2004, the school broke 29 offensive school records; compiling 5,446 yards of total offense and scoring 40 or more points in seven games. Their best offensive output was in 2005 when the Wildcats finished second nationally in total offense (493.5 ypg), third in scoring (41.7 ppg) and fifth in passing (300.1 ypg). They completed the season with an 11–2 record.
He was named the College Assistant Coach of the Year by the Gridiron Club of Greater Boston following the 2005 season in addition to being selected as “one of college football’s hottest coaches” by American Football Monthly. In 2006, quarterback Ricky Santos won the Walter Payton Award under Kelly's guidance, after Santos finished second in balloting for the award in 2005.
Kelly, along with Mississippi State head coach Dan Mullen, former Winnipeg Blue Bombers offensive coordinator Gary Crowton and Boston College offensive coordinator Ryan Day, are part of the so-called "New Hampshire mafia" as they all have strong connections to New Hampshire.
University of Oregon (2007-2012).
Chip Kelly led Oregon football to new territory after taking over as head coach in 2009. He coached the University of Oregon to BCS games in each of his four seasons as head coach; the 2010 Rose Bowl, 2011 BCS National Championship Game, 2012 Rose Bowl, and 2013 Fiesta Bowl. He coached Oregon to three consecutive outright conference championships from 2009-2011 and a conference division title in 2012. Oregon won its second consecutive BCS bowl game after they defeated #5 Kansas State in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl.
He was named the 2009 and 2010 Pac-10 Coach of the Year, 2010 Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, 2010 Walter Camp Coach of the Year, 2010 Sporting News Coach of the Year, 2010 AFCA Coach of the Year Award and 2010 Associated Press Coach of the Year.
Offensive coordinator.
Kelly was hired as offensive coordinator at Oregon in February 2007. His potent spread offense attack was an instant success at Oregon.
In his first season as offensive coordinator at Oregon, the Ducks led the Pac-10 in scoring (38.15 ppg) and total offense (467.54 ypg), and also became the highest scoring team while amassing the most yards in the history of Oregon football. Prior to Kelly's arrival at Oregon, Dennis Dixon struggled in his first three seasons at quarterback. Under Kelly's guidance, Dixon was the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year and emerged as a Heisman Trophy candidate.
In 2008, the Ducks once again led the Pac-10 in scoring (41.9 ppg) and total offense (484.8 ypg), while breaking the school record marks set the previous season.
Head coach.
On March 31, 2009, Oregon announced that head coach Mike Bellotti would be promoted to athletic director; consequently, Kelly would be promoted as head coach.
2009 season.
Kelly helped the Ducks gain national attention in 2009 after an upset of the then #5 USC Trojans on October 31. Kelly became the first Pac-10 coach to win an outright conference championship in his first season, sending the Ducks to the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1995. Oregon also became the first Pac-10 team to win a conference title by two games since Washington accomplished the feat in 1991. On December 7, 2009 Kelly was named Pac-10 Coach of the year. He was the second Ducks coach to earn the honor, the other being Rich Brooks (two times).
2010 season.
Prior to the 2010 season, Kelly suspended Jeremiah Masoli for the season after the quarterback pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary charges, marking the second year in a row that a key player was suspended. Masoli was later dismissed from the team following an arrest for marijuana possession and several driving infractions.
In early October, Kelly led the team to a #1 spot on the AP, Harris, and USA Today Coaches Poll, followed a few weeks later by a #1 BCS ranking. With a 37–20 win over the Oregon State Beavers on December 4, 2010, Kelly led the Ducks to a 9–0 finish in conference play, winning their second consecutive outright Pac-10 title. With Darron Thomas at quarterback and Doak Walker Award winner LaMichael James at running back, the Ducks averaged 49.3 points and 537.5 yards per game in the regular season.
In December, following an undefeated 12–0 season and an end-of-season #2 BCS ranking, Oregon was selected to play the #1 Auburn Tigers in the BCS national championship game on January 10, 2011. The Tigers, out of the Southeastern Conference, were coached by Gene Chizik, and had the Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback in Cam Newton. The Ducks lost, 22–19, on a last-second, 19-yard field goal by Wes Byrum.
In recognition of his coaching achievements, Kelly received the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, the Walter Camp Coach of the Year award and was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year for the second year running. Kelly also won the AP Coach of the Year.
2011 season.
The 2011 season began with the #3 Ducks facing the #4 LSU Tigers in the Cowboys Classic where they were defeated 40-27. Oregon won their next nine games, including a 53-30 blowout victory at #3 Stanford.
A consecutive trip back to the BCS Championship appeared to be a strong possibility, but they were defeated 38-35 by #18 USC when an Oregon field goal attempt failed as time expired.
The Ducks won their third straight Pac-12 championship title after defeating UCLA in the inaugural Pac-12 Football Championship Game. They represented the Pac-12 in the Rose Bowl and defeated #10 Wisconsin 45–38. It was their second Rose Bowl appearance in three years and their sixth overall. This was Oregon's third consecutive year in a BCS bowl game.
The Ducks finished the season 12–2 (8–1 Pac-12) with a #4 final season ranking.
2012 season.
Oregon's all-time leading rusher LaMichael James decided to forgo his senior season in 2012 for the NFL and starting quarterback Darron Thomas, with a career starting record of 23-3, surprisingly also decided to leave early for the NFL. However this did not stop Chip Kelly and his team from having arguably the best season in school history.
Led by redshirt freshman Marcus Mariota at quarterback and senior tailback Kenjon Barner, Oregon rolled to ten straight victories before finally falling to #14 Stanford in overtime 17-14 on November 17. Oregon had two opportunities to beat Stanford with a field goal but both attempts failed. Kelly's Ducks would rebound to beat #16 Oregon State in the Civil War for the fifth straight year and play #5 Kansas State in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. The Ducks proved to be too much for Kansas State as they prevailed to a 35-17 victory in Oregon's fourth consecutive year in a BCS bowl game.
The Ducks finished the season 12–1 (8–1 Pac-12) with a #2 ranking, putting them in the top five of the final season rankings for the third straight season.
NCAA sanctions.
On April 16, 2013, the "Oregonian" reported that the University of Oregon has offered to put its football program on two years probation in response to NCAA violations that allegedly took place during Kelly's tenure as head coach. On June 26, 2013 the NCAA Committee on Infractions issued its report concluding the investigation into Oregon's use of football scouting services. Oregon received 3 years of probation, reduction of scholarships, but no bowl ban. Kelly received an 18-month show-cause penalty, which would make his hiring by another NCAA institution difficult; Kelly had already left the NCAA for the NFL.
NFL interest.
New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin tried to hire Kelly as a quality control coach in 2006 when he was still the offensive coordinator at the University of New Hampshire. Kelly turned down the offer and shortly after became the offensive coordinator at the University of Oregon.
In the spring of 2009, Jon Gruden and Kelly spent several days in Tampa, Florida going over theories, progressions, and offensive strategies. In November 2010, Kelly visited Pete Carroll at the Seattle Seahawks practice facility during an Oregon bye week.
In January 2012, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers interviewed Kelly for the head coach position but he declined to take the job because he had "unfinished business to complete" with the Ducks.
During the 2012 offseason, Kelly met with New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick to discuss how he operated the "blur" offense that he ran at Oregon. New England then implemented a no-huddle hurry-up offense during the 2012 NFL season. "Oregonian" columnist John Canzano speculated that Kelly was waiting for the New England Patriots head coaching position to become available.
In early January 2013, numerous NFL teams expressed interest and Kelly was interviewed by the Buffalo Bills, the Cleveland Browns and Philadelphia Eagles. After a seven-hour meeting with the Browns followed by a nine-hour meeting with the Eagles, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Kelly initially decided to remain at Oregon. A week later, Kelly accepted the offer from Philadelphia and became the head coach of the Eagles.
Philadelphia Eagles.
Chip Kelly agreed to terms with the Philadelphia Eagles to become the team's head coach on January 16th, 2013. Although general manager Howie Roseman runs the team's drafts and free agency signings, Kelly has the final say over the 53-man roster. He is one of three current NFL coaches who have either the title or powers of a general manager, along with the New England Patriots' Bill Belichick and the Seattle Seahawks' Pete Carroll.
In his first season, Kelly reversed the Eagles' fortunes of the previous year. Taking over a team that went 4-12 in 2012, Kelly led the Eagles to a 10-6 record and the NFC Eastern Division Championship. They lost in the first round of the playoffs at home to the New Orleans Saints, on a last-second field goal. Despite the playoff loss, fans and analysts around the league believe him to be the second coming of Christ gifted to the city of Philadelphia. Tony dungy said he would be "shocked if the Eagles didn't win seven Super Bowls with Chip Kelly as their coach."
Coaching tree.
Chip Kelly is a member of the following coaching trees:

Personal life.
A lifelong bachelor, Kelly is reluctant to discuss his life outside of football. He has a small, tight group of friends back home in New Hampshire in the city of Manchester, New Hampshire who never speak about him to reporters. ESPN blogger Ted Miller describes Kelly as being "funny, biting, pithy, strange, fiery and surprising when talking to reporters."
Kelly gained national acclaim for responding to a season ticket holder's letter demanding a refund for his expenses after traveling to see Oregon's 19–8 loss to Boise State, which ended with Ducks running back LeGarrette Blount responding to a Bronco player's taunts by punching him in the face. Kelly replied to the man with a personal check written out for his travel costs (exactly $439); in response, the fan wrote him a thank-you note enclosing the original check, which he did not cash and made copies to frame.

Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso

"Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso" ("Telemachus on Calypso's Island") is an opera by composer Fernando Sor. The libretto was by Carlo Sigismondo Capece. It was first produced in Barcelona at the Teatro de la San Cruz on 25 August 1797. It was revived in the same city on 18 May 1798.
The work was thought lost for many years until a score was found in the early 1990s. A 1999 production of the opera was mounted at the Teatre Principal of Vilanova i la Geltrú by the Symphonic Orchestra of Garraf under conductor Joan Lluís Moraleda i Perxachs. The presentation was recorded on the Moleda label and was released on CD in 2000.
Other operas with the same title were written by Giovanni Vincenzo Meucci (1773), Charles Lepicq (1776), João Cordeiro de Silva (1787), Countess Maria Theresia Ahlefeldt (1792), and Simon Mayr (1797).

California Boulevard (Pasadena)

California Boulevard is a major East-West road in Pasadena, East Pasadena, and San Marino, California, measuring 5.7 miles in length. Much like Washington Boulevard to the north, California is commonly used to bypass the central neighborhoods of Pasadena, instead passing through more affluent neighborhoods and suburbs.
History.
California Boulevard was a major thoroughfare as early as the 1890s, being the location of Tournament Park, where the Tournament of Roses was originally held (the festivities were moved to Victory Park following the Second World War and the original grounds became part of the Caltech campus). The street was also served by two streetcar lines (East California and West California). At one time, a bridge over the Arroyo Seco was proposed to connect the neighborhood of Annandale with the rest of the city by streetcar, but the bridge was never built. Instead, a high bridge was built on La Loma Road, one block south.
Geography.
California Boulevard begins abruptly at the Arroyo Seco as a small residential street. At Pasadena Avenue, it serves as the current terminus for State Route 710. Between the highway and Marengo Avenue, the road passes through a heavy commercial/industrial zone, including Huntington Memorial Hospital, before returning to a residential street (mostly apartment buildings).
Between Wilson and Hill Avenues, the road passes through the campus of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and between Allen Avenue and San Gabriel Boulevard, the street runs through the northernmost edge of the city of San Marino.p
Between San Gabriel Boulevard and Michillinda Avenue, the road passes through East Pasadena. Past Michillinda, the road continues as Sunset Boulevard in Arcadia.

Scene study

Scene study is a technique used to teach acting. One or more actors perform a dramatic scene and are then offered feedback from teachers, classmates, or each other.
Scene Study is a very broad description for an acting class that will vary depending on the teacher or school that teaches it. Its foundation is in the performance of a "scene" or a segment of a play by the students. From this performance the instructor gives notes and suggestions to improve the student’s acting. Scene Study is instrumental for actors to get experience being directed. For beginning actors the Scene Study class may also include acting exercises that help them develop their technique. These exercises may help with skills such as emotional connection or character development and for the real novice it may be used to teach the vocabulary of acting (for example terms like down stage and subtext). However, most Scene Study classes are used for actors who already have their training and technique and now need the opportunity to take their skills and apply them towards performing on stage or on set. The best Scene Study classes will be able to keep improving an actor’s technique, as well as give them the opportunity to be directed and see if they are able to perform to a director’s specification. Scene Study is important because it allows an actor to see if all the techniques and exercises they use in class can be harnessed to create an honest and dynamic performance.

Yvonne Elliman's version was more successful than the Bee Gees' as her version reached #14 in the United States, #6 in the United Kingdom, #9 in Ireland, #3 in New Zealand and South Africa, #15 in Australia, #11 in Canada and #16 in Netherlands.
Martine McCutcheon's version.
Martine McCutcheon remade "Love Me" for her 1999 debut album "You Me & Us" from which the track - serving as the BBC Children in Need single for 1999 - was issued as the third single. It was released as a double A-side single along with "Talking in Your Sleep" and peaked at number 6 in the United Kingdom. It was re-released on 22 November in the week building up to the Children in Need event.
McCutcheon performed the song at the Children in Need telethon on 26 November 1999. She was supported by 100 children between the age of eight and thirteen, who were selected through nationwide auditions. The successful children had the chance to spend a day in a recording studio with McCutcheon, before serving as backing singers for the song on live television.
Other versions.
"Love Me" was also recorded by Janie Fricke for her 1981 album "Sleeping With Your Memory" and cantopop artist Prudence Liew for her 1994 album "Thoughts in the Night, Dreams During the Day".

Effects of the 2000s energy crisis

There is debate over what the effects of the 2000s energy crisis will be over the long term. Some speculate that an oil-price spike could create a recession comparable to those that followed the 1973 and 1979 energy crises or a potentially worse situation such as a global oil crash. Increased petroleum prices are however reflected in a vast number of products derived from petroleum, as well as those transported using petroleum fuels.
Political scientist George Friedman has postulated that if high prices for oil and food persist, they will define the fourth distinct geopolitical regime since the end of World War II, the previous three being the Cold War, the 1989–2001 period in which economic globalization was primary, and the post-9/11 war on terror.
Inflation and recession.
The perceived increase in oil price differs internationally according to currency market fluctuations and purchasing power of currencies. For example, excluding changes in relative purchasing power of various currencies, from 1 January 2002 to 1 January 2008:
On average, oil price has increased approximately 400% for these areas. As a result of the dramatic price increase there have been global protests.
Rising transport costs may start to reverse globalization, because distance will cost more and more money. As oil prices keep rising, transport costs could cancel out lower wage advantages, such as in East Asia.
United States.
It is easiest to gauge the effects of oil prices in the United States, where comparison of oil prices to average income are simplified. One of the most closely watched measures is the price of gas, but the average United States consumer's basket of goods contains many other petroleum products as well.
Despite the rapid increase in the price of oil, neither the stock markets nor the growth of the global economy were noticeably affected until supply declined rapidly starting in November 2007. Arguably, inflation has increased; in the United States, inflation averaged 3.3% in 2005–2006, as compared to an average of 2.5% in the preceding 10-year period. As a result, during this period the Federal Reserve has consistently increased interest rates to curb inflation.
Exactly how much trade, soaring transport costs divert from China (or for that matter anywhere else) depend ultimately on how important those costs are in total costs. Goods that have a high value to freight ratio carry implicitly small transport costs, while goods with low value to freight ratios typically carry significant moving costs. A high percentage of Chinese exports to the U.S. fall in the latter category. Furniture, apparel, footwear, metal manufacturing, and industrial machinery—all typical Chinese exports, incur relatively high transport costs.
Soaring costs are squeezing gas station owners too.
In 2008, a report by Cambridge Energy Research Associates stated that 2007 had been the year of peak gasoline usage in the United States, and that record energy levels would cause an "enduring shift" in energy consumption practices. According to the report, in April gas consumption had been lower than a year before for the sixth straight month, suggesting 2008 would be the first year U.S. gasoline usage declined in 17 years. The total miles driven in the U.S. began declining in 2006.
United States and GDP.
In the United States, for instance, each 1000 dollars in GDP required of oil in 1973 when adjusted for inflation, while this number had fallen to by 2001.
For calendar 1981, United States oil consumption was and GDP was $5,291.7 billion (chain-volume 2000 dollars), a ratio of $902.86/bbl.
In 2005, consumption was and GDP was $10,989.5 billion, a ratio of $1,447.36/bbl.
In 2006, consumption was and GDP was $11,294.8 billion, a ratio of $1,495.82/bbl.
In 2007, consumption was and GDP was $11,523.9 billion, a ratio of $1,526.68/bbl.
Many of the energy intensive industrial and manufacturing activities present in the 1970s U.S. moved out of the country during a period of outsourcing. Manufacturing as a portion of U.S. GDP has declined considerably since 1973. While the United States no longer makes as many goods and therefore does not expend as much energy to do so higher energy prices are still impacting the cost to manufacture these goods overseas. The increased cost impacts the U.S. GDP via the trade deficit. The size of this impact is difficult to estimate though the total energy/GDP effect should be commensurate with the 1970s value compensated by any efficiency gains from the outsourcing itself and the increased transportation costs.
United States stock market.
The increase in oil prices over two years was mirrored by an increase in stock values in the energy sector. Energy ETFs like XLE (an overall energy sector fund) and OIH (an oil service industry fund) did well during the period, with XLE's price increasing from $26 (1 January 2004) to $54 (2 March 2006), and OIH's price increasing from $60 (1 January 2004) to $143 (2 March 2006).
The value of the stock in companies such as Apache and Conoco-Phillips rose sharply during this period. These prices increased more rapidly toward the end of August, particularly after Hurricane Katrina.
Wal-Mart shares continued their decrease in value that began with the increase in the oil prices. Over two years, stock in Wal-Mart dropped in value by 25% from $60 per share to under $45 per share. Earlier in August, Wal-Mart announced that higher than expected oil prices cut into the corporation's profits for the 2nd quarter of 2005. Since oil prices after the end of the 2nd quarter continued to rise, 3rd quarter profits from Wal-Mart are expected to be small. Because Wal-Mart's distribution system relies on the customer to drive to a large discount big-box store, increases in the price of fuel might discourage some customers from making the trip as often. Wal-Mart, like all retailers, will also face higher shipping costs to get goods from the factory to the stores. This will likely cause inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, Wal-Mart's sales actually increased as a result as disposable income decreased due to the increased price of gasoline because of its economic role as an inferior good.
Europe.
In the European Union, the prices of transport fuels are made up of the price of the refined product, plus a substantial tax element, which can vary between roughly 2/3 and 3/4 of the total price ; in the UK, nearly 70% of petrol is made up of fuel duty and VAT, a doubling of the oil price would add perhaps 30% to the cost of fuel at the pump. Populations have lifestyles that are already well adapted to fuel prices that would appear very high to consumers in the USA (where the tax fraction is less than 20%). This long lasting tax system makes European demand largely independent of the crude oil price, at least over short periods of a few years.
The escalating price of oil in USD has been softer in Euro terms, as the US dollar lost approximately 30% of its value during the 2007–2009 period.
As a consequence, there is no 2000s energy crisis in Europe. The table below shows the absence of impact of the price extremum over consumption.
Asia Pacific region.
The Pacific rim had been experiencing oil shortages on an ongoing basis prior to Hurricane Katrina. Some countries are increasing production of biofuels to offset the higher costs of oil.
In July 2008, Malaysia experienced protests against high fuel prices.
In Indonesia, fuel subsidies grew to encompass "almost one third of the state budget".
On 15 July 2008, Japanese fishermen for the first time began a protest strike over the high cost of boat fuel (which had tripled over a three-year period). The high fuel costs have been compounded by higher domestic meat consumption, lower priced foreign competitors, and the cumulative effects of overfishing. During the strike around virtually the entire Japanese fishing fleet of 200,000 boats sat idle. This follows strikes by truck and taxi drivers, as well as other fishermen, in Asia, Europe and the U.S. Between 2006 and 2008, the number of fishermen in Japan dropped by as much as 20% and the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries projects this percentage to grow. 
Developing countries.
High oil prices are likely to first affect less affluent countries, particularly the developing world, with less discretionary income. There are fewer vehicles per capita, and oil is often used for electricity generation, as well as private transport. The World Bank has looked more deeply at the effect of oil prices in the developing countries.
An analysis finds that in South Africa a 125 percent increase in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum reduces employment and GDP by approximately 2 percent, and reduces household consumption by approximately 7 percent, affecting mainly the poor.
Sub-Saharan Africa.
High oil prices are hurting many countries in Africa, including Zimbabwe, Eritrea and Tanzania. High oil prices have created an oil supply instability, per barrel price instability or both. There are reports that this has led to fuel rationing being enacted in some cases. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa lack the foreign exchange reserves to purchase enough oil products at increasingly higher prices. These nations have little choice but to limit imports and/or ration their existing supplies.
Latin America and Caribbean.
Venezuela's president, Hugo Chávez, came under increasing scrutiny as he began selling heating oil at lower-than-market prices to poor U.S. consumers and to island nations in the Caribbean such as Cuba. Chavez came up with a programme known as PetroCaribe to sell oil and gas cheaply to states in the region.
Persian Gulf States and Eurasian Arab-Islamic regions.
Some stock markets in the GCC, notably in Saudi Arabia and Dubai, experienced a boom, roughly 100% index increase in the Saudi stock market. However, this boom was followed by a market crash. A number of planned projects to stir development, such as King Abdullah Economic City, have been proposed due to $29.3 billion surplus. On 1 May 2006 Saudi Arabia lowered prices on all hydrocarbon fuels for local consumption; 95 octane gasoline costs .606 USD/gallon (fixed price).
An EIA report stated that OPEC member nations were projected to earn a net amount of $1.251 trillion in 2008 from their oil exports, due to the record crude prices.
Transportation.
Ground transport.
Prior to the runup in fuel prices, many motorists opted for larger, less fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles and full-size vehicles in the United States, Canada and other countries where fuel taxes have historically been low. This trend began reversing in 2008 due to rising prices of fuel along with an increasing perception that future fuel prices will be at least as high. At the same time, appraisal and depreciation rates for SUVs, trucks, and vans have increased 30% and current SUV, truck, and van owners who cannot liquidate their gas-guzzlers because of low resale values are donating their vehicles for tax credits; this trend occurred during the 1973 oil crisis where musclecars and luxury cars faced the same predicament.
The September 2005 sales data for all the vehicle vendors indicated SUV sales dropped while small cars sales increased compared with 2004 sales. There is also an ever increasing market for hybrid vehicles (e.g., Toyota Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid) and diesel engine vehicles (e.g., Volkswagen TDI and Mercedes-Benz E320 CDI) since they are more fuel efficient; since the 1973 energy crisis, the front-wheel drive passenger car has replaced rear-wheel drive as the preferred layout for energy efficient cars. There is increasing demand of "crossover SUVs" (i.e., SUVs based on car-based unibody platforms) which are marginally lighter and therefore more fuel efficient than SUVs built on body-on-frame chassis. Some automakers have phased out truck-based SUVs for the crossover platform - Ford and Nissan (with its Explorer and Pathfinder) switched over whilst GM (with its GMT360 product line) phased their mid size SUVs out permanently with no replacement or merged into another vehicle line (e.g. the Chevrolet Traverse became the default replacement for the Trailblazer and Uplander minivan). 
The Union Pacific Railroad has had to address with its rising fuel bill, which has reached the point of becoming its single biggest operating expense. Airlines and oveseas shipping companies are also struggling to contain costs as their energy expense soar.
Anecdotal evidence suggested that in mid-2008, rising fuel prices motivated an increasing number of drivers to adopt fuel economy maximizing behaviors.
In July 2008, millions of Indian truck drivers joined a series of protests in Asia and Europe after crude oil's record run forced governments and fuel retailers to cut subsidies and raise prices.
Air travel.
Although Peak oil theorists such as David Goodstein, Richard Heinberg, and others, had for years predicted sharp declines in air travel following the peaking of world oil production and its subsequent decline, air travel enjoyed robust growth around much of the world spurred by low jet fuel costs starting in the mid-1980s. For example, air travel in the United States grew five times faster than population in the decades after 1978, with 769 million passengers boarding U.S. airline flights in 2007. However, the run-up in oil prices after 2003 began eroding airline profits, and the further doubling of oil prices from May 2007 to May 2008 began to have a substantial impact on airline operations, forcing airlines to reduce flight schedules, revertion back to one-stop service (especially with Trans-Pacific flights eg. Los Angeles to Singapore with a stopover in Tokyo or Seoul), imposing luggage weight limits, and pushing weaker carriers into merger or bankruptcy. During the first half of 2008, at least twenty-five airlines world-wide entered bankruptcy or were forced to cease operations.
April 2008 began with four small airlines (Aloha Airlines, Champion Air, ATA Airlines and Skybus Airlines) ceasing operations in a period of a week. A fifth airline, Oasis Hong Kong Airlines ceased operations on 9 April 2008. A sixth airline, Frontier Airlines filed for bankruptcy on 11 April 2008 to protect itself from its credit card processing company which was withholding airline ticket revenues. Frontier continues to operate under Chapter 11 and is working to get a new agreement with said company. Eos Airlines, a small specialty carrier with high costs, ceased operations on 27 April 2008. An eighth airline Nationwide Airlines ceased operations on 29 April 2008, due to the "impossibility" of profitably operating the Boeing 737-200 with oil prices of over $133 a barrel. The 737-200 is a 30 year old aircraft that is 30% less fuel efficient than new production 737's. On 9 May 2008, a ninth airline, EuroManx announced that it was ceasing all operations, citing rising fuel prices and reduced passenger numbers as the reasons. Airlines are downsizing their aircraft fleet - the Boeing 747 in use with the world's major airlines are gradually replaced with the newer variants of the 777 (which includes the proposed 777x series) or Airbus A350 since analysts are predicting that twinjets with 747 or Airbus A380 passenger/cargo capacity provide the same reliability as a four-engine jet. Analysts are stating that the sales of jumbo jets have resulted in fewer deliveries (both the 747-8 and A380 have generated fewer orders for passenger usage - the 747 has been a best seller for cargo/freight airlines). Another fact has suggested that twinjets with seating of 400 passengers (with a safety record of no engine failures while flying over the world's oceans e.g. Trans-Pacific or crossing the Atlantic) may result in the demise of 4-engined jets - Airbus has phased out production of its A340 and the days of the Boeing 747 are numbered despite rumors of the 'Queen of the Skies' being planned for a total phaseout. 
A 5% U.S. domestic capacity cut (since raised to around 15%) may be expanded to all airlines to save on fuel by eliminating older aircraft from their fleets similar to the exchange that took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although a slightly larger cut happened in the aftermath of 9/11 (20%), this is the first time since the 1970s that airline service has been cut to save on fuel for the United States. Other airlines such as Ryanair and Scandinavian Airlines System have also cut capacity.
Increasing fuel prices also caused "deep downturns" in air travel within China and India, in favor of a return to ground travel.
Shipping.
Recent changes in transportation have led to increased sensitivity to higher energy prices. Most notable of these changes is the massive trend towards containerization that effectively makes shipping costs more vulnerable to swings in fuel costs. Container ships can be unloaded much faster than break cargos so they spend much more time at sea than in ports.
Another factor is speed. The shift to container ships has increased the importance of ship speed. Over the past two decades, container ships were built to go faster than bulk ships and since container ships were steadily gaining share, the world’s fleet speed picked up. But greater speed requires greater energy, as it does in all other modes of transport. In global shipping, the increase in ship speed over the last fifteen years has doubled fuel consumption
per unit of freight. Accordingly, in 2008 some shipping companies responded to higher fuel costs by slowing down their ships, while companies such as SkySails began prototyping large towing kites to harness wind power, partly offsetting some engine power for propulsion.
The cost of shipping a standard container from East Asia to the U.S. Eastern Seaboard has already tripled since 2000 and will double again as oil prices head towards $200 per barrel. At 2008 oil prices, every 10% increase in trip distance translates into a 4.5% increase in transport costs.
Including inland costs, shipping a standard container from Shanghai to the U.S. Eastern Seaboard now costs $8,000. In 2000, when oil prices were $20 per barrel, it cost only $3,000 to ship the same container. Trans-oceanic transport costs also exploded during the two historic OPEC oil price shock. The cost
of shipping a standard cargo load overseas almost tripled, just as it did over the past few years.
Food security.
Since the 1940s, agriculture has dramatically increased its productivity, due largely to the use of petrochemical derived pesticides, fertilizers, and increased mechanization (the so-called Green Revolution). During this time, the world population has more than doubled. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%.
By late 2007, increased farming for use in biofuels, world oil prices at nearly $100 a barrel and growing consumer demand in China and India pushed up the price of grain. Food riots occurred in many countries across the world in 2007 and 2008. In December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Geologist Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that the coming decades could see spiraling food prices and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before.

Audio Messaging Interchange Specification

Abbreviated and regularly referred to as AMIS, the Audio Messaging Interchange Specification is a standard that allows the transmittal of intact voice mail messages between voice mail systems of different vendors - allowing a user to "forward" a voice mail message to a user on a different voice mail system (in a different geographic area, or conceivably, at a different company).
Developed in 1992, AMIS saw its heaviest use prior to the wide scale adoption of e-mail, as it was the fastest way to get urgent or time sensitive messages to large numbers of people (e.g. A sales team with a "broadcast" message).
Technical background.
AMIS is completely "in-band" and analog, meaning that the control commands to indicate who the message is from, the time received and "from" mailbox or caller ID information is all sent as a series of DTMF (Touch tone) digits - along with the message itself, which is transmitted (played and re-recorded by the target system) in real time.
Routing of messages is typically achieved through dedicated AMIS trunks which are just unpublished phone numbers or back doors into a voice mail system, set up to receive AMIS messages.
A voice mail system, on receiving a message addressed to mailbox it did not handle, would initiate an AMIS call to the target voice mail system and relay the message information along with the message itself. The target user could also reply to the message and the process would repeat in reverse.
Current Use.
AMIS is still used in larger corporate environments to transfer voice mail messages between geographically separate offices, however, e-mail and unified messaging (which allows forwarding of voice mail messages via email) is rapidly supplanting this purpose.
It is supported by most major voice mail systems manufacturers (IBM, Nortel, Lucent, Toshiba, Siemens, and Cisco among many others).
The AMIS standard was first published in 1992 by the Industry Information Association.

Issaquah Middle School

Issaquah Middle School is a middle school serving students in grades 6-8, in Issaquah, Washington and Bellevue, Washington as part of the Issaquah School District. Located in the vicinity of Issaquah Middle School is the Issaquah Community Center and Issaquah Creek, as well as the older portion of downtown Issaquah along Front Street. Students at Issaquah Middle School feed in from Cougar Ridge Elementary, Clark Elementary, Issaquah Valley Elementary.It is also part of the KING-5 TV weather network giving weather data of the city of Issaquah.
History.
Issaquah Middle School was constructed as the first middle school of the Issaquah School District and opened with the name Issaquah Junior High School in 1955 following a magnitude 6.5 earthquake that struck the greater Puget Sound region on April 29, 1965. About three decades later, the school was remodeled for two years of "live-in, learn-in" conditions with the remodel being completed in 1999.
Academics.
Roughly a third of the teachers at Issaquah Middle have 1 to 5 years of teaching experience with 71 percent of the teachers holding Master's and Ph.D degrees. The school offers a "highly capable" program called Humanities Plus which is a block class containing history and English curriculum for which 174 students are enrolled (as of 2008); an ESL Program for which 23 students are enrolled (as of 2008); and a special education program for which 80 students are enrolled (as of 2008). Issaquah Middle also offers high school credit foreign language classes and high school credit] mathematics classes. Issaquah has also introduced Smartboards to a majority of the classrooms as well as LCD projectors and document cameras.
Student life.
As of 2008, Issaquah Middle School has a WEB "Where Everybody Belongs" program which assists incoming sixth graders to adjust to the new environment of middle school. Since 2005, the school is involved in the Green Schools Program of King County, Washington which was adopted by the Issaquah School District to reduce outgoing waste from the school by increasing recycling and decreasing the usage of the garbage dumpster. Specifically, Issaquah Middle decreased its collection frequency/size of garbage dumpster saving nearly $17,000 when combined with the totals of four other Issaquah district schools.
Sports, Arts and Extracurricular Activities.
Issaquah Middle School has two sports teams which include boys and girls basketball, cross country, softball, wrestling for boys (and girls with special permission), gymnastics, track, volleyball for girls. Track is the main sporting event and the school has won a number of trophies over the years. The school also offers fine arts programs which include band, choir, orchestra, drama, photography, drawing-painting, ceramics. Mixed Media Art, and Graphic design. Members of the IMS band, chorus, and orchestra travel biennially to Silverwood for a recording session, as well as public performance. The intermediate and advanced Band, Orchestra, and Choir members Have 3 or more Concerts, as well as traveling to an annual festival in Spokane,WA, to compete with other schools. Extracurricular activities offered include Jazz Band, Chess club,
National Junior Honor Society(abv. NJHS), Math Olympiad, Robotics, Homework Club, Scrapbook/Sticker Club, Jazz Band, And Crystal Voices.
PTSA.
Issaquah Middle School's PTSA has provided the school with more than $15,000 in teacher grants, scholarships, ACTIVboards in classrooms and the annual eighth grade trip to the Junior Achievement Financial Park where the students learn real-world skills. The PTSA also provides the school with numerous hours of volunteering at school activities and services. Such an example of the volunteer work is the Walk About program. It is the first kind of program in the district containing nearly 120 parent volunteers who provide adult supervision on campus grounds before school, during lunches, and at the end of the school day.

More Information Than You Require

More Information Than You Require is a 2008 satirical almanac by John Hodgman. It is the follow-up to Hodgman's 2005 book "The Areas of My Expertise". It was released October 21, 2008. The full title reads:
"More Information Than You Require" is the second part of a trilogy, concluding with a final book titled "That Is All." This series of books is intended to be a collective whole, featuring continuous page numbering - that is, the last page of "The Areas of My Expertise" is page 236, and the first page of "More Information Than You Require" is page 237. The cover features John Hodgman holding a ferret, a reference to one of the "long cons" from "The Areas of My Expertise".
The 700 Mole-men Project.
Analogously to the 700 Hoboes Project, Hodgman began a second illustration project for the 700 "Mole-manic Names" contained in "More Information Than You Require". The website and Flickr group began accepting submissions on October 21, 2008.

Andrea Carlo Lucchesi

Andrea Carlo Lucchesi (November 1860 — 1924) was an Anglo-Italian sculptor, born and trained in London, who had a career in the United Kingdom as an exponent of the naturalistic and symbolist "New Sculpture". His portrait of Queen Victoria is on the facade of the Art Gallery, at Bath.
Lucchesi received his early training from his father, also a sculptor, and at the West London School of Art; he first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1881. In 1882 his "Waif" won him acceptance at the Royal Academy schools, where he remained five years (1881–86). He was a member of the Art Workers Guild, established in 1884 to promote the "unity of the arts" 
Lucchesi specialised in the female nude, naturalistically represented under allegorical titles, such as "Destiny" and the undisguisedly erotic "Myrtle's Altar" (1899), manifesting clear influences of Art Nouveau and, in the finely modelled symbolic representations of crown, sword, spilled bag of coins, of Symbolism. In addition to his own work, he assisted Henry Hugh Armstead and Edward Onslow Ford, and provided models for electroplate silverware by Elkington & Company and the Crown Jewelers, Garrard's. He also produced portrait busts: his bronze bust of Sir John Franklin (1898) is conserved at the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Clone Wars Adventures

Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures is an online virtual world based on the animated television series Star Wars: . Players create and customize in-world avatars and can participate in a variety of Clone Wars themed mini-games and activities, earning Republic credits to purchase new weapons, outfits, ships, and furniture.
"Clone Wars Adventures" is free to download and play, but only those that have a paid membership get access to a majority of the game's features. Additionally, many outfits and premium items can only be purchased with Station Cash, a form of in game currency that players need to purchase with real money instead of in game credits.
This MMO game follows a similar business model to the popular SOE MMO, "Free Realms". However, unlike "Free Realms," the game was released at retail, though the game is free-to-play.
"Clone Wars Adventures" reached one of its milestones after 10 million players registered for the game. The first ten million players who joined were given a free Golden Death Watch set and a huge presentation of game statistics from SOE since the game's launch. 
On January 24, 2014 Sony Online Entertainment announced that the game will be shut down on March 31, 2014.
Business Model.
Currency.
Clone Wars Adventures uses two forms of currency: 
Republic Credits are the standard currency for purchasing items throughout the game. Credits be obtained through various activities and mini-games. Players can use Credits to buy gear, furniture, companions, etc.
Membership.
"Clone Wars Adventures" is free to download and play, but free players will have restricted access to mini-games, equipment, furniture, and game areas. 
For a monthly subscription fee, members have full access to game content, excluding any premium items that must be purchased separately with station cash such as original costumes or exclusive actions and housing items.
Members are given access to VIP areas, more Mini-Games, the ability to wield dual-lightsabers, member-only items, the exclusive Jedi battle class, and a special deluxe house. Members are also allowed much more access to more mini-games, furniture, and extra game content.
Jedi Memberships:
Gameplay.
Setting.
The in-game world of "Clone Wars Adventures" is set in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant set between Episodes II and III of Star Wars. Here players can interact with popular Clone Wars characters like Anakin Skywalker, Commander Cody, Captain Rex, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and play more than 30 different mini-games including Lightsaber Duel, Republic Defender, a tower defense game, and Speeder Bike Racing. Other mini-games are campaign based on Seasons 3, 4, and 5 from Star Wars the Clone Wars. Players can challenge each other in multi-player games to win Credits. Even though the game is based on the Jedi temple, players can travel to different planets like Ryloth, Umbara, and Carlac when going to the hangar bay.
Players can also interact with other players using the world chat, which allows communication and chatting to a certain distance, or private chat, allowing players to run a conversation with only one other person. Players are also given a buddy list, to add and chat with friends, and an ignore list, to block all communications and requests from that particular player. Additionally, Members can even create player guilds (squads) to allow maximum interaction with friends and access to a private chat room.
All players are given options to play games, build on their own lots, participate in events, and much more. The environment of the game is constantly changing, with weekly updates adding content to the game for players to experience for themselves.
Mini-Games.
"Clone Wars Adventures offers" a huge selection of mini-games including strategy, action, puzzle, racing, and combat games.
Mini-games were initially any player's main source of income - Republic Credits. However mini-games also offer challenges and goals for players. There are 30+ mini-games for players to play. Non-members are given partial access to a minority of the games, while paying Members are rewarded with total access and the full experience to each mission.
Most mini-games have their own trophies that come along with completing a challenging feat in that certain mini-game. Select mini-games have their own title that are assisted with it like Jedi General for Republic Defender or Jedi Ace for Starfighter. Another game is lightsaber duel.titles include: Blademaster Duelist and Sentinal
Combat Zones.
Players can engage in battles with droids, umbarans, Death Watch troopers, and infamous characters like Darth Maul on combat zones. The game offers four combat zones, Umbara, Ryloth, Felucia, and Carlac which contain active quests, mini-games, missions, and sometimes and exclusive title or reward. Players can explore these worlds by foot or vehicle, and face dangerous enemies. Typically, all AI enemies drop 2 Republic Credits that players can use to purchase a wide variety of items, and leftover scrap items.
Using the player combat system, a diverse system of fighting both AIs and live players alike, both members and non-members can unleash powerful attacks upon their opponents who usually drop a special piece of material used to craft various items or complete collections.
Players are given access to abilities that depend on the current weapon the player is using, power-ups with companions, and field equipment to aid them in combat.
Player Housing.
All players are given their own personal house in game. Free players are provided a Felucian Starter Lot, while members are given the larger and more customizable Jedi Living Quarters in addition to the lot. Originally, players were given a free Padawan Dormitory. Add on rooms like the Droid Destruction Chamber or the Hidden Armory can be purchased with Station Cash. 
Additional player houses can be purchased with Station Cash as well, like the Attack Cruiser house that gives the player access to their own Republic battleship, and a Mustafar Lot which allows players to customize their house on a volcano surrounded by rivers of lava. Each of these houses has its own set of furniture appropriate for its environment such as Cruiser sets and Mustafar furniture. A huge selection of lots are available at the In-Game Store for Station Cash, while others are only obtainable through specific activities or mini-games, like the Tatooine lot.
Players can customize their houses with furniture and other decorations. Non-Members are allowed one set of housing items based on lower city furniture, while Jedi members are given access to purchase over 30 different sets of furniture including regular furniture, turrets, and building materials using game Credits or Station Cash. Players are still allowed access to these even when their membership ends, but only if they still have them in their furniture storage. Station Cash furniture sets include Gungan furniture, Mon Calamari aquatic furniture, and alien guests. Some items can even perform actions when clicked upon like disco balls and turrets.
Sony allows players to buy promotional items like tree lights, face masks, and sparklers on special Holidays such as Valentine's Day, and Christmas (known in Star Wars as "Life Day").
Players can invite their friends over to their houses for parties, gatherings, etc. A house rating system allows players to give the player's house a rating from 1-5 stars. Players can submit their houses for rating and even name their own lots, but are not permitted to edit the house until it is removed from the housing directory.
Companions.
Players can purchase droid companions like R2-D2 or TO-DO to follow them around in game. There are also special attachments that allow pets to do new things, like a boombox to make other players dance, or mounted guns to fire lasers when clicked on. Players can also unlock more droids like C-3PO by entering special game codes on the Clone Wars Adventures website home page. Other companions include adopted creatures such as a Jawa.
There are several Creature Pets available such as the Convor, a bird-like creature, with helmet attachments available for purchase. Other creatures include an Anooba, Kowakian Monkey-Lizard, a brown rancor, and a red rancor, which can only be obtained when receiving the pet in a special crate by purchasing a SC Code to open it.
Upon with the entertainment of owning a companion, players are also given special abilities associated with their current pet. These power-ups provide boosts like speed and extra-damage while on the battlefield or not.
Interaction.
Tournaments and Events.
All events current to date will be displayed in the Event Calendar. The Event Calendar can be accessed via the "Play Games" button. 
Official SOE employees can be observed many times hosting events in Clone Wars Adventures in which all players are welcome to attend. Such events are referred to as "Emissary Events" in reference to its host, Emissary Event, the lead emissary represented as a player but with a pink colored player name. Events include Speeder Bike Racing, Lightsaber Dueling, House Inspections, Trivia Events, and many more. Players have the chance to even obtain prizes from participating in these events including DO-T, a blue protocol droid.
Players are always welcome to attend Emissary Events, as present in the Event Calendar.
Apart from Emissary Events, Daily Tournaments challenge players to a specific mission is mini-games, Attack Cruiser, Republic Defender, and Starfighter. Upon reaching a high score, players are measured in the top 100 list according to the time they played and the score they received. All players within the top 100 leaderboards will receive a special bundle of prizes and Credits.
Squads.
Clone Wars offers Jedi Members to create player guilds (squads) as a way to chat with a large group of people, set up an organization, or just to get to know other players. Special squads including ones that are created by Emissaries or CWA Counselors are strictly off-limits to any player. Players can also create squads that focus only of specific people groups like Clone Troopers, Jedi, Sith, Bounty Hunters, etc.
When creating a squad, the player will be required to name the squad and submit it for approval by a Moderator. A notice will be sent to the squad create when their squad has been created so they may begin to recruit players. All squads have a limit of 100 members and are each given their own private chat that is only visible to squad members. 
Upon recruiting players to the squad, the leader or leaders have the option to promote members. Only Jedi Members can be promoted; Padawans cannot. The player is given the choice on how high to promote the member. They are also given the ability to demote any member.
Promotions:
Players can only be in one squad at a time, but may decide to leave if they want to further explore different squads.
If a player creates a hate group or slave-trading squad, their account could be suspended or even banned from CWA, since it violates the rules of conduct for squads on Clone Wars Adventures. Any issue concerning a hate group will be immediately dealt by an Enforcer.
Staff.
Clone Wars Adventures consists of numerous employees responsible for the development of the game, fixing of bugs, and the utmost safety of the players. 
Emissaries primarily focus on interactions with online players, the hosting of events, and monitoring of the forums. Emissaries always appear with a neon-pink name and the word "Emissary" before their name, assuring players that they are talking with an official staff member. 
Counselors are the only other staff employee visible by players within the game. They are tasked mainly with the responsibility of ensuring a player's safety in the virtual environment. Counselors respond to player submitted complaints and questions in the Help section of the Clone Wars Adventures website. 
Player Classes.
Battle Classes.
Battle Classes were introduced to players on the update of September 28, 2012. The system allows a more achievable set of goals and rewards upon defeating enemies in combat zones.
Players are given four primary battle classes, Jedi, Trooper, Sith, and Mercenary to rank up in and obtain exclusive rewards. The Trooper class is set as a default for all players and is free, while sinister classes, Sith and Mercenary require a Station Cash purchase of 750 SC to experience. Unlike the other battle classes, Jedi is only accessible through a paid membership without any additional purchase. Additionally, paying members are given a 50% discount on both the Sith and Mercenary classes alike.
All battle classes require experience points to allow players to rank up in. Experience points are dropped by defeated enemies in combat zones and mini-games. Ranks gradually become more difficult as the player progresses through that particular class. Along with ranking up, players are given a while new set of titles corresponding to rank, and several pieces of wearable gear.
Specialty Classes.
Specialty Classes, alongside battle classes, differ in several ways including the fact that they do not require combat zones to progress in. Specialty classes are passive player classes used within certain mini-games and are ranked up via certain activities.
For example, the Scoundrel class incorporates Card Assault, a card based mini-game, with this specialty class. Upon the completion of campaign missions, the player rises through the ranks and is rewarded a special deck of cards.
Development.
"Clone Wars Adventures" was developed and published by Sony Online Entertainment, the developers of well received massively multiplayer online role playing video game, Free Realms. It was announced at E3 2010, and is based on the animated television series Star Wars: .
Safety and Privacy.
"Clone Wars Adventures" is given an ESRB rating of Everyone 10+ for crude humor and fantasy violence. The game has also been given an ESRB Kid's Privacy Certification to further ensure the safety for children playing "Clone Wars Adventures". The game was designed with young fans of the television show in mind. In an effort to support online safety for children, strict filters only allow pre-approved words to be shown in chat, restricting the ability of a player to communicate personal information to others in game or to use bad language. The chat filter also blocks out numbers or numerals to prevent the use of further personal information or private codes.
Reception.
"Clone Wars Adventures" received several mixed reviews from critics.

<doc id="19367047" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19367047" title="Haumea family">
Haumea family

The Haumea or Haumean family is the only identified trans-Neptunian collisional family; that is, the only group of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with similar orbital parameters and spectra (nearly pure water-ice) that suggest they originated in the disruptive impact of a progenitor body. Calculations indicate that it is probably the only trans-Neptunian collisional family.
Characteristics.
The dwarf planet is the largest member of the family, and the core of the differentiated progenitor; other identified members are the moons of Haumea and the Kuiper belt objects , , , , , , , , and , all with an ejection velocity from Haumea of less than 150 m/s. The brightest Haumeids have absolute magnitudes (H) bright enough to suggest a size between 400 and 700 km in diameter, and so possible dwarf planets, if they had the albedos of typical TNOs; however, they are likely to be much smaller as it is thought they are water-icy bodies with high albedos. The dispersion of the proper orbital elements of the members is a few percent or less (5% for semi-major axis, 1.4° for the inclination and 0.08 for the eccentricity). The diagram illustrates the orbital elements of the members of the family in relation to other TNOs.
The objects' common physical characteristics include neutral colours and deep infrared absorption features (at 1.5 and 2.0 μm) typical of water ice.
Formation and evolution.
Collisional formation of the family requires a progenitor some 1660 km in diameter, with a density of ~2.0 g/cm3, similar to Pluto and Eris. During the formational collision, Haumea lost roughly 20% of its mass, mostly ice, and became denser.
The current orbits of the members of the family cannot be accounted for by the formational collision alone. To explain the spread of the orbital elements, an initial velocity dispersion of ~400 m/s is required, but such a velocity spread should have dispersed the fragments much further. This problem applies only to Haumea itself; the orbital elements of all the other objects in the family require an initial velocity dispersion of ~140 m/s. To explain this mis-match in the required velocity dispersion, Brown "et al." suggest that Haumea initially had orbital elements closer to those of the other members of the family and its orbit (especially the orbital eccentricity), changed "after" the collision. Unlike the other members of the family, Haumea is in a chaotic orbit, near the 7:12 resonance with Neptune, which would increase Haumea's eccentricity to its current value.
A second proposal suggests a more complicated origin for the family: that the material ejected in the initial collision instead coalesced into a large moon of Haumea, which gradually increased its distance from Haumea through tidal evolution, and was then later shattered in a second collision, dispersing its shards outwards. This second scenario produces a velocity dispersion of ~190 m/s, considerably closer to the measured ~140 m/s velocity dispersion of the family members; it also avoids the difficulty of the observed ~140 m/s dispersion being much less than the ~900 m/s escape velocity of Haumea.
Haumea may not be the only elongated, rapidly rotating, large object in the Kuiper belt. In 2002, Jewitt and Sheppard suggested that should be elongate, based on its rapid rotation. In the early history of the Solar System, the trans-Neptunian region would have contained many more objects than it does at present, increasing the likelihood of collisions between objects. Gravitational interaction with Neptune has since shifted many objects from the Kuiper belt to the more distant scattered disc.
The presence of the collisional family hints that Haumea and its "offspring" might have originated in the scattered disc. In today's sparsely populated Kuiper belt, the chance of such a collision occurring over the age of the Solar System is less than 0.1 percent. The family could not have formed in the denser primordial Kuiper belt because such a close-knit group would have been disrupted by Neptune's subsequent migration into the belt, which is believed to have been the cause of its current low density. Therefore it appears likely that the dynamic scattered disc region, in which the possibility of such a collision is far higher, is the place of origin for the object which would become Haumea and its kin. Simulations suggest the probability of one such family in the Solar System is approximately 50%, so it is possible that the Haumea family is unique.
Because it would have taken at least a billion years for the group to have diffused as far as it has, the collision which created the Haumea family is believed to have occurred very early in the Solar System's history. This conflicts with the findings of Rabinowitz et al. who found in their studies of the group that their surfaces were remarkably bright; their colour suggests that they have recently (i.e. within the last 100 million years) been resurfaced by fresh ice. Over a timescale as long as a billion years, energy from the Sun would have reddened and darkened their surfaces, and no plausible explanation has been found to account for their apparent youth.
However, more detailed studies of the visible and near infrared spectrum of Haumea show it is a homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1:1 mixture of amorphous and crystalline ice, together with no more than 8% organics. This high amount of amorphous ice on the surface confirms that the collisional event must have happened more than 100 million years ago. This result agrees with the dynamical studies and discards the assumption that the surfaces of these objects are young.

The son of François Paradis and Marcelline Coupal, Paradis represented the provincial electoral district of Napierville in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1881 to 1886 as a member of the Quebec Conservative Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1878 and again in 1886 and 1890.
In the 1887 federal election, he stood as the Conservative Party candidate in the federal district of Napierville, but was defeated by Louis Ste-Marie. Following Ste-Marie's resignation in 1890, Paradis was acclaimed to the seat in the resulting by-election, but he was defeated again by Liberal Dominique Monet in the 1891 election.
Paradis was educated at Saint-Michel and Hemmingford. He was mayor of Saint-Michel from 1880 to 1881. Paradis was married twice: to Basilide Robert in 1863 and to Marie Renaud in 1880. After his defeat for a seat in the House of Commons in 1891, he moved to Montreal, where he became involved in real estate. Paradis died there at the age of 66.

John L. Nelson

John Lewis Nelson (June 29, 1916 – August 25, 2001), also known as Prince Rogers, was an American jazz musician. He is known for having been the father of the musician Prince and a credited co-writer of some of his songs.
Life.
Nelson was born in Louisiana. He traveled to Minneapolis to become a musician in 1948. Playing the piano, he used Prince Rogers as a stage name and started The Prince Rogers Trio with local musicians.
Nelson maintained on-off relationship with Vivian Nelson. With her, he had four children: Sharon L. (born 1942), Lorna L. (1943–2006), Norrine (born 1947), and John R. (born 1948). Nelson had another son, Duane, with Vivian in 1958.
In 1956, he met Mattie Shaw (1933–2002), at a show on the north side of Minneapolis. Shaw was an aspiring jazz musician who became the musical group's singer. Nelson married Shaw and had two more children, musician Prince on June 7, 1958 (who was named after his father's stage name) and daughter Tika Evene (usually known as Tyka) in 1960. When Nelson's career failed in late 1960, the couple became estranged and formally separated in 1966.
Nelson died on August 25, 2001, aged 85, in his home in Chanhassen, Minnesota.
Work with Prince.
Nelson was a major influence on Prince's music, writing (or co-writing) some music which was released by his son in the 1980s. With some of these songs, Prince gave Nelson a co-writing credit for using chord sequences Nelson often used, rather than Nelson actually co-writing the songs with Prince.

Cwmystwyth

Cwmystwyth (also Cwm Ystwyth; ) is a village in Ceredigion, Wales near Devil's Bridge, and Pont-rhyd-y-groes. 
The Ordnance Survey calculates Cwmystwyth to be the Centre point of Wales, (; ) 
History.
"See" Cwmystwyth Mines
Discovery of small, oval-shaped stone tools in the area points to the fact that it has been mined for lead since the time of ancient Britons and during Roman occupation. Documentation of mining activities occurred during the reign of Elizabeth I. She engaged the services of two German miners, then went on to sub-let to Hugh Myddleton.
Community Archive Wales Project.
Cofnodion Cwmystwyth is a recently established local history group based in Cwmystwyth. The group has 14 regular members of various ages drawn from the Communities First area of Tregaron Uplands, all with a passion for the history of the area. As well as including images, the archive includes transcriptions of census data, baptismal registers and log books as a means of interpreting the history of the village. In the long-term, it is hoped that the project will act as a springboard for establishment of a Cwmystwyth History Society which would produce materials relating to the area and eventually to the creation of a heritage centre to showcase the history of the village. Cofnodion Cwmystwyth joined the Community Archives Wales project in 2007.
Climate.
Cwmystwyth experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification "Cfb") similar to almost all of Wales and the United Kingdom. This translates to a narrow range of temperatures, rainfall in all seasons and low sunshine levels, particularly at upland locations such as inland Wales.
The MetOffice maintains a weather station in the village, with online climate records dating back to 1959. Temperatures range from an absolute high of recorded during July 2006, down to an absolute low of , recorded during January 1963. During an 'average' year, the warmest day will likely reach and the coldest night fall to . In total just over 3 days should record a temperature of or above, and 59.3 nights should report an air frost.
Rainfall, as one might expect for an elevated place in Wales, is high, at nearly 2000mm a year. At least 1mm will be observed on over 189 days of the year, on average. All averages refer to the period 1971-2000.

Veridian Credit Union

Veridian Credit Union is a credit union in Iowa, with assets over US$1.4 billion and a member base of over 145,000 Veridian is the largest credit union in the state of Iowa and among the largest credit unions in the nation. Veridian offers a range of products, including credit cards, checking accounts, savings accounts, and loans. 
History.
Veridian began in 1934 as John Deere Employees Credit Union with their office located in Waterloo, Iowa. It began with just a few John Deere employees who were looking for alternative financial options to what commercial banks had to offer.
By 1984, credit union membership was available to all those in the outlying community and the name was changed to John Deere Community Credit Union of Waterloo. Their field of membership continued to grow. By 1986 membership opened up to the neighboring community of Cedar Falls, which again called for a change in the name and lead them to drop the "Of Waterloo" and leave it as John Deere Community Credit Union.
In 2004 Deere & Company asked the credit union not to use "John Deere" in their name to avoid trademark and company confusion. This led to yet another name change in 2006 to the current name Veridian Credit Union. The name "Veridian" is derived from the words "verdant" meaning green and growing, and ""veritas"" which is Latin for truth. 
The credit union funds some financial literacy programs.

New Zealand Conceptual Framework

The New Zealand Framework (NZ Framework) is an accounting conceptual framework based on the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) Framework. It was issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Board (FRSB) of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and approved by the Accounting Standards Review Board in 2004 under the Financial Reporting Act 1993. At the time the framework was issued, New Zealand financial reporting standards were sector-neutral. Accordingly, relative to the IASB Framework, the NZ Framework incorporates additional material applicable to public benefit entities. 
The NZ Framework outlines the concepts which underpin information presented in general purpose financial statements, and in non-financial information which is included in or accompanies the financial statements. It is used by the FRSB in working with the IASB to develop International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or in developing local Financial Reporting Standards (FRS). It may also be used by various parties to the financial reporting process (e.g., preparers, auditors, etc.) as a basis for the application of judgment in resolving accounting issues.

Personal life.
He was born to Don Jose Cojuangco, Sr. and Demetria Sumulong. He is the seventh of eight children (Ceferino (stillborn), Pedro, Josephine Cojuangco-Reyes, Teresita C. Lopa, Carmen (died during infancy), Corazon C. Aquino and Maria Paz C. Teopaco). He is married to Margarita "TingTing" de los Reyes,

Bautista); Josephine Victoria, (married to Francisco Javier T. Guingona); Mikaela Ma. Antonia C. Jaworski, married to Robert Vincent Jude B. Jaworski, Jr.; Margarita Demetria, (married to Andrea Zini) and Regina Patricia Jose.
Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.
He is the brother-in-law of Benigno Aquino, Jr, the staunch rival of former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. During the height of his family's political empire, Cojuangco and his family acquired many of the biggest companies in the Philippines, including Hacienda Luisita, a major agricultural farm, and San Miguel Corporation, the largest beer brewer in the country.
In the 80s, it was believed that he wanted his brother-in-law, Aquino, out of political office because his plans of acquiring and privatizing many other companies would not be approved by his brother-in-law. Because he was officially affiliated with Aquino through blood ties, he did not support dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the political sphere. However, because Aquino stood in the way of Cojuangco's plan to acquire more companies, it is suspected that Cojuangco was the mastermind who plotted the assassination of Benigno Aquino, not Fabian Ver.
After the assassination, Cojuangco continued privatizing and acquiring companies, acquiring Meralco during the Philippine martial law period.

Unexpected Song

"Unexpected Song" is a 1984 song from the musical "Song & Dance" originally sung (on Broadway) by Bernadette Peters. The music was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, with lyrics by Don Black. A single was released by Sarah Brightman. Originally released by Marti Webb and Justin Hayward as a duet in 1981 the song had new lyrics penned for the original 1982 production of the show and was re-titled "When You Want to Fall in Love". The original lyrics were re-instated when the show was re-written for Brightman's run. It was later used in Lloyd Webber's and Black's reworking of the show, returning to the original album title of "Tell Me on a Sunday". The single peaked at #76 on the UK Singles Chart.
The song's melody was originally heard as Variation 5 on Lloyd Webber's 1978 instrumental album "Variations". The remainder of the album became the dance music for the second act of "Song & Dance".

Bronze (turkey)

The Bronze is a breed of domestic turkey. The name refers to its plumage, which bears an iridescent bronze-like sheen. The Bronze had been the most popular turkey throughout most of American history, but waned in popularity beginning in the mid-20th century. Later in its history, the breed was divided into two distinct types: the Broad Breasted Bronze and the Standard Bronze. A great deal of confusion exists about the difference between Standard and Broad Breasted Bronzes, or that there is any difference at all. Collectively, the Standard and Broad Breasted varieties are simply called the Bronze turkey.
History.
Bronze turkeys are the product of crossing domestic turkeys brought from Europe by colonists (which had been exported to Europe years before) with the Wild Turkey. These matings produced a bird that was larger and more robust than the European turkeys, and tamer than wild turkeys. Though the Bronze turkey type was created in the 18th century, the actual name was not used until the 1830s, when a strain developed in the U.S. state of Rhode Island was named the "Point Judith Bronze". The name later spread to be used in reference to the breed as a whole, and was in the process simplified to just "Bronze". In the British Isles, the Bronze was associated with Cambridge, and was called the "Cambridge Bronze", but again this name has been simplified to just "Bronze".
The Bronze was first admitted into the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1874. Later, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Bronze turkeys were selected for larger size. These much bigger birds became known as the "Broad Breasted Bronze", to differentiate them from the original type of bird which was bred to the breeds' Standard of Perfection, and so was called the "Standard" (or "Unimproved") "Bronze".
Apart from the difference in size, the plumage of the Standard Bronze is usually lighter and more lustrous than that of the Broad Breasted. Both have a brown color which is highlighted by shades of copper and blue-green, and the plumage overall is very similar to that of the Wild Turkey.
The Broad Breasted Bronze went on to dominate the commercial turkey industry for twenty years after its development, until the Broad Breasted White became the breed of choice. Due to their size, they have lost the ability to mate naturally, and Broad Breasted Bronzes in existence today are maintained entirely by artificial insemination. Having retained the ability to reproduce naturally (among other traits), the Standard Bronze is considered to be a variety of heritage turkey.
Today, both the Standard and Broad Breasted Bronze turkeys are listed on the ALBC's conservation priority list. The Standard is listed as "Critical", but the exact numbers of Broad Breasted are currently unclear. Standard Bronzes have additionally been included in Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.

Buchla 200 series Electric Music Box

The Buchla 200 series Electric Music Box is an electronic musical instrument manufactured by Buchla & Associates in Berkeley, California from 1970 to 1982. It is a modular analog system consisting of a collection of individual modules. Systems are assembled in cabinets designed to accept modules occupying between one and six modules spaces in width, each space being 7 inches tall and 4.25 inches wide. 
Power for the modules is provided by a power supply contained within the cabinet. Voltage rails of +15, −15 and +5 volts are included on all supplies in the series. Some of the power supplies also provide +24, −24, and +12 volts. Noisy and quiet ground lines, generally those for digital and analog circuits respectively, are provided on all supplies as well. Generally, only older modules in the series require the 24-volt lines and only later ones require the unregulated +12-volt line (using it only to power LEDs). The connectors used to route the power changed over the production years, but finally settled on a 10-pin edgecard connector with pin 7 blocked to provide a directional key.
What separates the 200 series from its predecessor, the 100 series, is that almost every parameter is under voltage control. Functional density is higher, packing several functions into each module. The electronics employ op-amps, CMOS and TTL logic chips and quite often Vactrols, photoresistor opto-isolators devices used as voltage-controlled potentiometers in variable-gain amplifier (VCA) and voltage-controlled filter (VCF) sections. The approximately 10 ms rounded attack and 50 ms release of the Vactrols contributes substantially to the "natural" sound that Buchla 200s are credited with. The 200 series also often shows the state of its outputs with LED indicators.
The modules that were manufactured for the Buchla 200 series are as follows:
In 2001, Buchla returned to the 200 series and released the Barber Pole modules, models 260 and 297. The 260 is a Duophonic Pitch Class Generator, an oscillator capable of creating a sound that seems the same in every octave. The 297 is an Infinite Phase Shifter. More often referred to as a barber pole phaser, the module creates a filter effect that seems to rise or fall, but never actually changes frequency range being effected. 
In 2003, Buchla released the 255 Control Voltage Processor. Although released shortly before the 200e system, it is not considered part of the 200e system, likely because of its lack of patch storage capability, and received a non-"e" model number. It was the first Buchla module to be released with the 200e's characteristic Selco knobs, which are white capped to indicate that the values will not be stored by a 225e module.

Cardinology

Cardinology is the tenth studio album by Ryan Adams, and fourth album with his backing band The Cardinals, released on October 28, 2008. The album completed Adams' contract with Lost Highway Records, and marks his final recording session with The Cardinals. Following the album's release and subsequent tour, Adams disbanded the band and entered a self-imposed hiatus until the release of "Ashes & Fire", in 2011.
According to Adams, the album " about the moment when you recognise the difference between ego and pride and your sense of service to your friends, family or yourself. Once you've had that epiphany, you can't really turn around and pretend that you haven't. It's about accountability."
The album was placed at #14 on "Rolling Stone"'s 50 Best Albums of 2008 list. The magazine also placed "Magick" at #13 on the 100 Best Singles of 2008 list. The album has sold over 250,000 copies worldwide. In April 2011, Adams released an EP, "Class Mythology", featuring four unreleased tracks recorded for "Cardinology".
Writing and composition.
"Cardinology" was written and recorded in the aftermath of Adams' break-up with girlfriend Jessica Joffe, with Adams stating, "There's a lot of disappointment on this record. There's the pain of lost love and the brutality of unrequited love. It was a dark place to go, but this time I managed to go there with a bit of balance. I tried to make sure there were at least one or two lines in every song that, should someone be listening who is having a bad time, there's something there telling them to keep the faith. I wanted to find that hope. I didn't fully find it, but I was trying."
Release.
A vinyl version included a bonus 7", a comic book, and a digital download code. The album's first single, "Fix It", was released on vinyl and online on September 23, 2008.
Reception.
The album so far has a score of 72 out of 100 from Metacritic based on "generally favorable reviews". Silent Sound Waves gave it a score of five sound waves out of six and said it was " brave and successful in its flow and creativity. A must have for Ryan Adams fans and something worthwhile for curious listeners." "Hot Press" gave it a favorable review and called it "an album worthy of high praises." "Billboard" also gave it a favorable review and said, "Musically, the band works up a handsome country rock sound with shades of the Rolling Stones and Wilco throughout, making room for swagger ('Fix It,' 'Magick') and sentimentality ('Natural Ghost,' 'Evergreen') in equal measure." Similarly, "The Boston Globe" gave it a favorable review and said, "If only a few of the tracks rise to the greatest heights of which Adams is capable--like the poignant closing salute to sobriety, 'Stop'--the rest remain impressive pictures of craftsmanship." "Prefix Magazine" also gave it a favorable review and said it " jettisons the schizoid, freewheeling genre-hopping of previous records, giving the album--and, most important, the songs--an intensity of focus where there was once just intensity."
"The A.V. Club" gave it a B and stated: "Even at his slightest--and Cardinology is pretty slight--Adams always turns out likeable ear candy." Tiny Mix Tapes gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said: "The new attention to cleanly produced and perfectly played and arranged backdrops function as both a blessing and a curse."
Other reviews are average or mixed: "Uncut" gave it a score of three stars out of five and said it ultimately "serves as another minor indictment of Adams’ famously lackadaisical internal editor. Neveretheless, it is still, almost infuriatingly, a stretch better than most people at their best." Yahoo! Music UK gave the album only five stars out of ten and said, "The first half of the album as a whole is easy to forget...Cardinology takes a turn for the best around the midway point." "Under the Radar" also gave it five stars out of ten and said that "if you’ve always wanted to hear U2’s frontman lead a hook-filled classic country/rock band, "Cardinology" is for you. If, however, you’re waiting for Adams to deliver the classic album his prodigious talents seem capable of, you’re stuck waiting until his multiple personality disorder wears off and he remembers who he is." "Slant Magazine" gave the album two-and-a-half stars and stated that "too often "Cardinology" seems content to float along on an oily sea of good feelings and bad attitude."

Binter Mediterraneo was a Spanish airline with its head office in the Domestic Departures area of Málaga Airport in Málaga, Spain., the airline was created in 1988 in the likeness of Binter Canarias, another a subsidiary of Iberia LAE. Binter Mediterraneo was based in Madrid and operated a fleet consisted of five CASA CN-235 aircraft.
Binter Mediterraneo linked the city of Melilla to Málaga, Almeria, Valencia and in its last year, with Madrid. Binter ceased operations after one of its planes crashed on 29 August 2001 in the vicinity of Málaga airport while performing the Melilla-Malaga route. Iberia was sold in June 2001 to its franchise Air Nostrum, owned by Nefinsa .
Air Nostrum, another Iberia subsidiary, acquired Binter Mediterraneo in 1998 and absorbed its operations. It replaced the remaining CN-235's with ATR-72s.
Incidents.
On 29 August 2001 Binter Mediterráneo Flight 8261 (Registration EC-FBC) crash-landed next to N-340, some 200 meters short of the runway 32 at Málaga Airport at Málaga, Spain. The pilot reported to Málaga Air Traffic Control, while on final approach, the aircraft's left engine had failed, and that he would have to perform an emergency landing. The plane descended, hitting the first edge lights and stopping right next to the N-340. Subsequent investigation into the accident revealed that, shortly after the initial engine failure, the First Officer inadvertently shut down both of the aircraft's engines, leading to a total loss of power. Four out of the 44 people on board were killed, including the pilot Capt. Fdez. Ruano. The aircraft was scrapped.

Marjorie Keller

Marjorie Keller (1950–1994) was an experimental filmmaker, author, activist, film scholar, and wife of P. Adams Sitney, the American avant-garde cinema historian. J. Hoberman called her "an unselfish champion of the avant-garde."
Early life and education.
Keller was born in 1950 in Yorktown, New York. The youngest of seven children, Keller grew up in a large, upper-middle-class, Protestant family. As a girl, Keller's mother schooled her in the feminine arts of cooking, gardening and entertaining. 
Keller never gave up these skills (she even used them as inspiration for her films), even though other feminists of her time frowned upon such domestic jobs. B. Ruby Rich (a friend of Keller's and another important member of the feminist film movement), fondly remembers a Passover dinner that Keller made in this passage from her memoir: 
"And the food was great, because Margie was already a fabulous cook: for a rebel girl of that era, she was remarkably versed in the female arts."
Keller first attended Tufts University, but finished her coursework at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago after getting expelled from Tufts for participating in a protest in 1972. She then went on to pursue her master's degree and then her doctorate in Cinema Studies at New York University in 1975. During her years at Tufts and the Art Institute of Chicago, Keller was instructed by American avant-garde filmmakers Saul Levine and Stan Brakhage.
Politics.
Marjorie Keller was deeply entrenched in the politics of her generation. She was arrested for participating in a protest at the White House against Nixon's price control policies, and she actively demonstrated at the Republican National Convention in 1972. Keller openly supported the issues of welfare reform, labor union rights, and AIDS awareness throughout her life. Although politically active, she only made one expressly political film, "Hell No: No Cuts!", which dealt with racism and the welfare system.
Feminism in relation to Keller and her films.
At the time Keller was making her films, the feminist movement of the 1960s and 70's was in full swing. As a result of this movement, feminist film theory was applied to a majority of films made by women in that era. Keller openly rejected the structural rules and regulations based on feminist film theory. In a review of E. Ann Kaplan's 1983 book "Women and Film" Keller stated that theory "obfuscates women's film making in the name of feminism." Keller refused to work within the confines set up by film theorists, many of whom have never made a film themselves. Because of this ideology, Marjorie Keller's work was shunned by the critical feminist world.

Marjorie Keller's work exists in the experimental realm of the lyrical and the "diary" film styles pioneered by Stan Brakhage, Gregory Markopoulos, and Marie Menken (all of whom are cited as being big influences. In her films, Keller used themes and images from her own life and experiences. She explored what it was like to be a feminist in the latter half of the twentieth century, in her own way. Children were also an inspiration to her. This can be seen in both her films and her writings.
Marjorie Keller made over twenty-five films in her brief lifetime.

She also published a children's pop-up book that she wrote and illustrated herself titled "The Moon on the Porch". At the time of her death, she was working on a book about women experimental filmmakers, which was never completed.
Other work.
In addition to being a filmmaker, author, activist, and scholar, Keller also served on the board of directors of the Collective for Living Cinema and was the founding editor of their journal, "Motion Picture" from 1984 to 1987. She was also the head of The Film-Makers' Cooperative in New York for a period of time in the late 1980s, and was a professor of film making and film history at the University of Rhode Island.

2001 Independence Bowl

The 2001 MainStay Independence Bowl, part of the 2001–02 bowl game season, took place on December 27, 2001, at Independence Stadium in Shreveport, Louisiana. The competing teams were the Alabama Crimson Tide, representing the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and the Iowa State Cyclones of the Big 12 Conference (Big 12). Alabama won the game, 14–13 in what was the first all-time game between the programs. It was also the first bowl game for Dennis Franchione at Alabama and the second bowl game for Dan McCarney at Iowa State.
Teams.
Alabama.
The 2001 Alabama squad finished the regular season with a 6–5 record in head coach Dennis Franchione's first season leading the Crimson Tide. Through eight games, the Crimson Tide were 3–5 with losses to UCLA, South Carolina, Ole Miss, Tennessee and LSU. However, Alabama was able to win their final three games against Mississippi State, Auburn and Southern Miss to finish the regular season bowl eligible with a 6–5 record.
On December 9, Alabama accepted a bid to play in the Independence Bowl for the first time in school history. There was some controversy with the selection of Alabama instead over Ole Miss, as the Rebels (which did not go to a bowl in 2001) had beaten Alabama that year and had a better record of 7–4. Presumably, Alabama was selected because it had a larger fan base and Ole Miss had just played in the Independence Bowl in 1998 and 1999. The appearance marked the 51st all-time bowl appearance for Alabama. 
Iowa State.
Iowa State finished the regular season with a 7–4 record with losses against Nebraska, Texas A&M, Kansas State and Colorado. On December 9, Iowa State accepted a bid to play in the Independence Bowl for the first time in school history. The appearance marked the sixth all-time bowl appearance for the Cyclones. 
Game summary.
Iowa State would put the first points on the board off of a 36-yard Tony Yelk field goal to lead 3–0 in the first quarter. After reaching the 1-yard line on a 33-yard by Lane Danielsen to close the quarter, the Cyclones would score the game's first touchdown on a 1-yard run by Joe Woodley to give State a 10–0 lead. Alabama would respond later in the quarter with an 8-yard touchdown run by Andrew Zow to close the gap to 10–7. Yelk would then miss a 25-yard field goal with 0:26 remaining in the quarter to keep the score 10–7 at the half.
Third quarter scoring would be limited to a single, 41-yard Yelk field goal to bring the Cyclones lead to 13–7 going into the fourth. With 5:31 remaining in the contest, Waine Bacon blocked a Yelk punt with the recovery occurring on the Iowa State 29-yard line. Two plays later, Zow hit Terry Jones for a 27-yard touchdown reception, and the extra point gave the Crimson Tide a 14–13 lead. The Cyclones just missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 0:46 remaining in the fourth, which would have given State the lead and potential victory. Subsequent to the game there was some question about whether or not the field goal was actually good, as it sailed directly over one of the uprights. The victory sent Alabama to a 7–5 overall record for the season.

Cut to shape

Cut to shape is a philatelic term referring to a postage stamp or postal stationery indicium (printed stamp image) that has been cut to the shape of the design, such as an octagon, circle or oval, instead of simply cut into a square or rectangular shape. 
Stamps cut to shape almost always command a lower price than those cut square, and sometimes have little or no value, especially envelope indicia cut to shape. Although many stamps unfortunately have been cut to shape by stamp collectors, some early stamps were produced without perforations and were often cut to shape by people before they affixed the stamps to their envelopes. This is true, for example, for the octagon-shaped 4 Annas stamp of India issued in 1854, which is most commonly found cut to shape on envelopes or pieces. 
All of the surviving examples of the India 1854 (inverted head) are postally used. Only two (or three) are known cut square; another 24 or so are cut to shape (that is, in an octagonal shape). One from the collection of the Earl of Crawford was exhibited in the World Philatelic Exhibition in Washington in 2006.
The "world's most famous stamp" — the unique 1856 British Guiana 1c magenta — is cut into an octagonal shape. Consequently, it has been referred to as being cut to shape, although technically that term is incorrect as the stamp design is rectangular in shape.

Tom Dreesen

Tom Dreesen (born September 11, 1942) is an American stand-up comedian.
Life and career.
Dreesen grew up in Harvey, Illinois, south of Chicago. He attended Thornton Township High School there. While working as an insurance salesman in 1968, he met Tim Reid through a local Jaycee chapter, and the two teamed up as Tim and Tom, the first biracial stand-up comedy duo in the United States. Shortly thereafter they sought the assistance of radio personality Vince Sanders, who would coach the act and handle some of its business affairs for the next four years.
Though their material is now considered cutting-edge for its time, the pair struggled to make a living together and split up in the mid-1970s. However, each found individual success: while Reid landed a major role on "WKRP in Cincinnati", Dreesen became a regular on "The Tonight Show" and toured with Frank Sinatra as the crooner's opening act. In 1989, Dreesen released a comedy album through Flying Fish Records called "That White Boy's Crazy". The album was recorded in front of an all-black audience in Harvey, Illinois.
Dreesen continues to perform today. He is also involved in philanthropic endeavors and hosts an annual golf tournament called the Tom Dreesen Celebrity Classic. In 2008, Dreesen, Reid, and former "Chicago Sun-Times" sportswriter Ron Rapoport collaborated on the book "Tim and Tom: An American Comedy in Black and White". Vince Sanders also wrote a book about Dreesen and Reid, titled "That's Not Funny!"
Dreesen has appeared in acting roles in the television series "Columbo", "WKRP in Cincinnati" and "Murder, She Wrote", and in such films as "Spaceballs", "The Rat Pack" and "Trouble with the Curve".
In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

2008 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000

The 2008 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 was the twelfth running of the Australian 1000 race, first held after the organisational split over the Bathurst 1000 that occurred in 1997. It was the 52nd race tracing its lineage back to the 1960 Armstrong 500 held at Phillip Island.
The race, which was the tenth round of the 2008 V8 Supercar Championship Series, was held on the weekend of 9-12 October at the Mount Panorama Circuit just outside Bathurst, in New South Wales, Australia.
Craig Lowndes, Jamie Whincup, driving a Ford BF Falcon for TeamVodafone, won the race for the third year in succession, the first 'three-peat' of Bathurst 1000 wins since 1984 when it was achieved by Lowndes' mentor, Peter Brock and present day Jack Daniel's Racing team principal, Larry Perkins for the Holden Dealer Team.
Driver changes.
The following driver changes were made following the 2008 L&H 500:
Alex Davison joined the Glenfords Racing team alongside regular driver Fabian Coulthard, replacing John McIntyre who substituted for Davison at the L&H 500.
Karl Reindler replaced Grant Denyer at Ford Rising Stars Racing. Denyer suffered a spinal injury on 17 September while driving at the NSW Monster Truck Championships at the Dapto Showgrounds and will be sidelined for some months.
Practice.
Free practice began on Thursday 9 October when three sessions were held. The first session, (in which the top 15 placegetters from the 2007 V8Supercar Championship Series are not allowed to take part), was topped by Warren Luff in the second Jim Beam Racing Falcon with a 2:10.7158 ahead of Tony D'Alberto in the Rod Nash Racing Commodore and Alex Davison in the Glenfords Racing Falcon.
Garth Tander topped the second session, recording a 2:09.3700 in the Holden Racing Team Commodore ahead of Craig Lowndes in the Team Vodafone Falcon and Greg Murphy in the Sprint Gas Racing Commodore. Jason Bargwanna continued D'Alberto's form from the first session to be fourth fastest in a session marred by a crash for Jack Perkins who backed the Jack Daniel's Racing Commodore into the wall across the top of the Mountain, putting the car out of action for the day.
A second red flag emerged in the longest third session, for the Sprint Gas Racing Commodore shared by Mark Noske and Dale Wood. After the resumption Jamie Whincup recorded the fastest time of the day, a 2:07.5975 in the Team Vodafone Falcon, to be two hundredths quicker than Greg Murphy (Sprint Gas Racing Commodore). Mark Winterbottom was third fastest for Ford Performance Racing ahead of Rick Kelly (HSV Dealer Team Commodore), Russell Ingall (Supercheap Auto Racing), Steve Owen (Jim Beam Racing), Paul Dumbrell (HSV Dealer Team), Lee Holdsworth (Garry Rogers Motorsport), Shane Van Gisbergen (Stone Brothers Racing) with Garth Tander completing the top ten fastest cars.
In the first practice session on Friday morning a major accident occurred at Sulman Park when Chris Pither struck a stationary Paul Weel. Weel had to be cut from the wreckage, but neither driver was seriously hurt. Both cars were withdrawn suffering from extensive damage. With both cars belonging to single car teams, Paul Weel Racing and Team Kiwi Racing appeared to be eliminated from the meeting. However the Team Kiwi Falcon was repaired and did in fact start in Sunday's race.
Garth Tander topped the morning's practice sessions with a 2:06.9922, with Jamie Whincup recording a 2:07.1371 in the second Friday session. Combined times saw Craig Lowndes third fastest ahead of James Courtney, Jason Richards, Steve Owen, Greg Murphy, Will Davison, Steven Richards all under 2:08 with Mark Winterbottom completing the fastest ten drivers.
In Saturday morning practice Jason Richards recorded the fastest lap of the weekend, a 2:06.9076. Paul Radisich had a major accident at McPhillamy Park Corner when a stuck throttle pushed the HSV Dealer Team Commodore into the wall. Radisich broke his right ankle in the accident. The car sustained heavy damage and was subsequently withdrawn. Later in the day it was announced that David Reynolds would step out of his drive in the second HSV Dealer Team Commodore in order to allow Rick Kelly to start the race.
Qualifying.
Mark Winterbottom took provisional pole position during qualifying on 10 October, snatching it in the final lap of leg two to secure the tenth and final Top 10 Shootout position with a 2:07.1920 lap. Jason Richards had held top spot for the final ten minutes of the session, finishing second fastest. Jamie Whincup was third fastest ahead of James Courtney. Garth Tander was fifth fastest in the Holden Racing Team Commodore ahead of arms-length teammate Rick Kelly. Will Davison and Paul Dumbrell were next with Fabian Coulthard climbing into the top ten towards the end of the session in the Paul Cruickshank Racing Falcon. Tenth fastest and first Shootout position was claimed by Russell Ingall, with Max Wilson spinning at Murray's Corner on the last lap chasing a top ten position.
A power steering leak took Lee Holdsworth out of qualifying by pitching him into the wall at the Dipper, leaving him in 14th, while Fabrizio Giovanardi damaged the second Triple Eight Race Engineering Falcon, bringing out red flags during leg one of qualifying.
After the withdrawal of the damaged Kelly/Radisich car, the Wilson/Jones entry was promoted into the Top 10 Shootout.
Top 10 Shootout.
The Top 10 Shootout was held on Saturday 11 October 2008. Max Wilson and Fabian Coulthard were rapidly consigned to the bottom spots, handicapped by a lack of fresh tyres for the Shootout. Paul Dumbrell was quick jumping into a high 2:07 lap. Will Davison was untidy on his lap. Garth Tander was very quick, recording what become pole position, a 2:07.2963. James Courtney was quick, but half a second behind Tander. Jamie Whincup's car appeared unsettled and Jason Richards had a big moment at Reid Park, losing him two tenths of a second that he never recovered. Mark Winterbottom was ahead of Tander at the second sector split but was slower down the hill, finishing second fastest, 0.12s behind Tander. 
Race.
From pole position Garth Tander stalled allowing Steven Richards to lead early. Later Tander was also assigned a ten second penalty for jumping the start as well. The Penalty was served at the car's first pitstop. Into Griffins Bend on the opening lap Craig Lowndes and Greg Murphy touched, giving the Holden slight damage which caused Murphy to pit on lap four. James Courtney raced through to dominate the opening stint. Craig Lowndes gave chase with Will Davison settling in to chase with Max Wilson and Russell Ingall leading the Holden charge while Steven Richards and Rick Kelly (starting Paul Dumbrell's Commodore) slid backwards.
Starting with Jack Perkins on lap 15 cars started to appear in the pits with a failed left rear tyre. Delaminations were to strike the entire field throughout the day, with the cars of Will Davison, Todd Kelly and Lee Holdsworth worst affected of the front runners. Kayne Scott was the first retirement on lap eight, the hastily repaired Team Kiwi Racing Falcon was four-five seconds behind the pace and effectively unraceable. The second retirement was on 40 when Andrew Jones spun the Brad Jones Racing Commodore into the wall at Griffin's Bend. Jones limped the car back to the pits without bothering the safety car. By this stage Rick Kelly was out of contention, with the same sticking throttle that caused the #15 car to crash on Saturday starting to blight the #16 car.
A slowly deflating tyre (originally diagnosed as a damaged anti-roll bar) slowed David Besnard's stint in James Courtney's car allowing Jamie Whincup to assert dominance over the field in the second stint.
The first safety car occurred on lap 73, after Todd Kelly spun his Jack Daniel's Racing Commodore across the Chase dumped sandtrap debris across the most delicate corner of the circuit. Marshals worked to clean the corner and get the race quickly back under way. The third safety car was called about 15 laps later when Michael Patrizi spun the Ford Rising Stars Falcon at Murray's Corner. Just after the restart Jonathan Webb put the second Stone Brothers Racing Falcon into the sandtrap at McPhillamy Park after striking the wall exiting the previous corner, becoming the race's third retirement. Lowndes pitted for Whincup's second stint at this point. With a safety car having s recently occurred Whincup was buried, emerging back into the field in 17th position. Will Davison moved into the lead at this point that he would hold until lap 98 when he pitted. Greg Murphy led for a single lap before pitting for Jason Richards, handing the lead to Max Wilson. Wilson lead until the next safety car on lap 106 when he pitted for Brad Jones and Jamie Whincup resumed the lead.
By this stage Mark Skaife had removed the lead Holden Racing Team Commodore from contention, wiping the car's nose across the Forrests Elbow wall. A safety car on lap 128 caused the majority of the field to pit, putting David Besnard back into the lead until his final stop for James Courtney on lap 137. Two rapid safety cars occurred shortly afterwards, first after Lee Holdsworth's Commodore stopped in the Cutting, then at the restart a touch between Craig Baird, who had just been unsettled by another car passing him at Griffin's Bend, and Warren Luff in the second Jim Beam Racing Falcon, put Baird into the wall. Luff was given a drive-through penalty for his part in the incident. Russell Ingall also dropped out at roughly this point with power steering failure.
At the lap 147 restart Lowndes led from Steven Richards and Greg Murphy. Tucked in behind were Max Wilson and James Courtney ahead of Tony D'Alberto, Fabian Coulthard, Warren Luff (about to pit for his penalty), Jason Bright and Luke Youlden. Courtney, on fresh tyres and cut through the pack and on lap 153 ducked under Max Wilson at Forrests Elbow for fourth place. Murphy, while faster than Richards was unable to get by, allowing Lowndes to build a comfortable buffer. On lap 158 Murphy finally moved into second position at Hell Corner and set off after Lowndes. Two laps later, Richards, fading badly on rear tyres was unable to stop Courtney move into third place. The gaps stabilised over the final laps and Lowndes took a two second victory, earning himself and Jamie Whincup their third consecutive victory, a feat not managed since Peter Brock and Larry Perkins took their third consecutive win in the 1984 James Hardie 1000.
Behind Murphy and Courtney, Steven Richards hung onto fourth position ahead of Max Wilson. Tony D'Alberto spun into the Griffins Bend wall on the second last lap, becoming the races final retirement. Will Davison climbed back into sixth position after a late race tyre delamination had removed him lead battle. Luke Youlden completed a good team result for Ford Performance Racing in seventh ahead of Jack Perkins and Jason Bright. Fabian Coulthard dropped to tenth after having to make a pitstop for fuel with two laps to go. Warren Luff was the final car to complete full race distance in eleventh.
Garth Tander limped home in twelfth place ahead of Mark Noske, Marcus Marshall and Fabrizio Giovanardi. Two of the hardest hit by tyre delaminations, Steve Ellery and Todd Kelly finished 16th and 17th and were the last fit cars home. Ingall limped his car home for some championship points ahead of Patrizi, while Rick Kelly and Dumbrell were classified in 20th position after the team rebuilt the throttle linkages, having lost 34 laps.
The race victory vaulted Whincup back into the championship lead he lost after crashing out of the Hamilton 400 in April. Tander's twelfth place finish helped to minimise the points loss but dropped to third place behind Mark Winterbottom.

Heinrich Cotta

Johann Heinrich Cotta, also Heinrich von Cotta, (October 30, 1763 – October 25, 1844) was a German silviculturist who was a native of Kleine Zillbach, near Wasungen, Thuringia. He was founder of the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry, in Tharandt, and is known as a pioneer of scientific forestry. He was the father of geologist Bernhard von Cotta (1808–1879).
Education and early career.
Cotta reportly said of himself: 
Initially learning forestry from his father, in 1784-85 Cotta enrolled at the University of Jena, where he studied mathematics, natural sciences and cameralism (public administration). In 1785, he returned to Zillbach to teach forestry at one of the earliest master schools of forestry, with his father. In 1801 he became a member of the forestry college in Eisenach, while continuing his work at Zillbach. During this time his reputation grew, and in 1810 Cotta was appointed director of "Forstvermessung und Taxation" (Forest Measurement and Rating) by Frederick Augustus I of Saxony.
Founder of the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry.
In 1811 he established a forestry school at Tharandt, near Dresden, together with its arboretum, the Forstbotanischer Garten Tharandt, still in existence. The school later would be known as the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry; and lives on today as site of the Department of Forestry of Dresden University of Technology. The new forestry school attracted students throughout Europe, and in 1813 was visited by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In 1841 Cotta was given an award by Tsar Nicholas I in recognition of his efforts at Tharandt.
Pioneer of modern forestry.
Cotta was a pioneer of modern forestry, and was a catalyst concerning the transition from "timber production" to forestry as a scientific discipline. He was interested in all aspects of forestry, including studies involving long-term seeding, establishment of forested areas, and tree-cutting based on mathematic practices. Cotta's methodology was based on a geometric survey of the forest, where calculations of the wood mass of individual trees as well as the yield of the entire forested region were made. By way of these calculations an estimate for the monetary worth of a forest could be assessed. In 1804 Cotta was the first to suggest the concept of a "volume table", which was a chart that was introduced decades later to aid in the estimation of standing timber volume. In 1816 Cotta wrote: 
Paleontogical interests.
Cotta also had a keen interest in geology and fossils, and during his career amassed an impressive collection of zoological and botanical fossils. Today, pieces of this collection are kept at Humboldt University of Berlin (Institute for Paleontology), in the museum for natural history in Chemnitz, at the Academy of Mining in Freiberg, in the State Natural History Collections in Dresden and in the British Museum of Natural History in London.

1996 Arizona Cardinals season

The 1996 Arizona Cardinals season was the 77th season the team was in the league and 9th in Arizona. The team improved upon their previous output of 4–12, winning seven games. Despite the improvement, the Cardinals failed to qualify to the playoffs for the fourteenth consecutive season.
The low point of the season was providing a notorious New York Jets team with its only win in front of less than thirty thousand people. This was, amazingly, the first time the Cardinals had opposed the Jets since "1978". The reason for this is that before the admission of the Texans in 2002, NFL scheduling formulas for games outside a team’s division were much more influenced by table position during the previous season.

The two water approaches to Indian Cove County Park on Shaw Island pass to either side of Canoe Island, which protects Indian Cove from high waves and surf. At low tide, mudflats in the shallow cove may be exposed. The island has a maximum elevation of 60 feet and has a span. The island supports a moderately heavy growth of madrone, cedar, fir and hemlock trees growing on a small amount of soil. The shore of Canoe Island is fringed by kelp and seagrass. The narrowest part of Upright Channel lies between Canoe Island and Flat Point on Lopez Island, where the channel is scarcely 400 yards wide.
The Washington State Ferry route from Anacortes to Friday Harbor passes between the southern corner of the island and Lopez Island.
Canoe Island is home to Canoe Island Camps, and is privately owned by the camp, a non-profit organization.

Northern Transportation Company

Northern Transportation Company Limited (NTCL) is a marine transportation company in the Canadian and American Arctic owned by Norterra, a holding company jointly owned by the Inuvialuit of the Northwest Territories and the Inuit of Nunavut. While primarily a marine freight hauler on Canadian rivers, like the Mackenzie and the Hay and along the Arctic coast of Canada, they are also a petroleum wholesaler. Its head office is now in the town of Hay River, Northwest Territories. Today, it uses primarily tugs and barges.
History.
The company was an outgrowth of the competition in the Yukon between the new Northern Trading Company and the entrenched Hudson's Bay Company. Colonel J.K. Cornwell, one of the principals of the Northern Trading Company, ran his first steamer, "The Midnight Sun", on the Lesser Slave Lake River in 1904. The company acted as a kind of subsidiary of the Northern Trading Company until its formal creation in 1930 as Northern Waterways Limited, but its name was changed in 1934 to the Northern Transportation Company Limited. It was one of the first haulers on the Mackenzie River after the Hudson's Bay Company, starting up just after the Yukon gold rush. In 1936, it was taken over by the Eldorado Gold Mines Limited and Arthur Berry was appointed manager in Edmonton. In 1944, it became a Crown corporation when its parent, then known as Eldorado Mining and Refining, was nationalized by the government of Canada.
The company has been involved in North Slope operations since 1963. In 1975, then under the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard Northern Division of Transport Canada, it became the sole marine shipper in the Canadian Arctic operating of out of Churchill, Manitoba. In 1959, it moved its operational headquarters to the town of Hay River. In 1985 it was purchased by the Inuvialuit Development Corporation and Nunasi Corporation, two native-owned corporations.
The ""Radium Line"".
In 1937 the Northern Transportation Company started to introduce new diesel powered steel tugboats to tow barges on the Mackenzie River.
The first two vessels were the "Radium Queen" and "Radium King". Other vessels in this fleet included the "Radium Express", "Radium Yellowknife", "Radium Prince", "Radium Cruiser", "Radium Scout", "Radium Charles", "Radium Gilbert" and "Radium Lad", earning the fleet the name ""The Radium Line"". Port Radium on Great Bear Lake, a mine that supplied much of the uranium used by the Manhattan Project, and later the company's uranium mines on Lake Athabasca in northern Saskatchewan, were key destinations for the fleet.
The tugs were constructed in eastern shipyards, then disassembled, so the parts could be shipped by rail to Waterways, Alberta, a river port on the Clearwater River, which was then the northern terminus of the North American railway grid. The "Radium Queen" was reassembled there. From Waterways tugs could only navigate the Clearwater, Lake Athabasca, and some of its tributaries. The Slave River, that drained Lake Athabasca to Great Slave Lake, had a stretch of rapids that had to be portaged around, at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. The "Radium Queen" towed the parts of the "Radium King" to Fort Smith, where they were portaged, and reassembled on the lower river. Most of the fleet were reassembled on the lower Slave River.
Ice on the Mackenzie River, and her tributaries, impeded navigation until early June. Freeze-up occurs in mid October, providing only a few months of navigation.
All of the tugs had extremely shallow draft, and mounted their propellers in cavities under their hull.

<doc id="19367718" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19367718" title="Truculentus">
Truculentus

Truculentus is a comedic Latin play by the early Roman playwright Titus Maccius Plautus. Following the relationships between prostitutes and their customers, it contains perhaps Plautus’s most cynical depiction of human nature in comparison with his other surviving plays.
Plot.
There is very little to the plot of "Truculentus", the play mostly revolves around the interactions between the prostitutes and the men. Phronesium, the main prostitute, relentlessly persuades every male she encounters to give her all their money, by means of trickery or more often by simple flirtation. The men are more than happy to comply with her wishes, although they complain frequently of their regrettable situation. They are essentially under her spell, and are completely unable or unwilling to do anything to break free from it. Her alluring outward façade masks her cold and greedy true nature. 
Diniarchus, the man most often at her house, has almost entirely lost his wealth to her by the play’s beginning. By this point, he’s all too familiar with whom she really is and the games she plays. He even assists her with deceiving other men, but nonetheless continues to be her victim as well. 
The main deception is played on the soldier Stratophanes. He had lived with Phronesium prior to the plays beginning, and before leaving the city had made many promises to her about what she’d have if they were to start a family together. Phronesium decides to borrow someone’s baby and pretends she has just given birth to it, claiming that it is his when the soldier returns. He begins lavishing her with gifts, however these are not enough for her insatiable appetite. She attempts to gain more by making him jealous, feigning excitement over the gifts of Diniarchus, and later pretending to be in love with a third man, Strabax, her rather dimwitted neighbor. 
Throughout the play, Phronesium’s maid Astaphium (who is more of a protégé to Phronesium than a maid) attempts to seduce the men as well. Almost as skilled in the art of seduction as her mentor, she works her feminine charms on several of them, and is even successful in charming the only one of which who resisted, Truculentus.
The character for which the play gets its name, Truculentus, attempts to protect his dimwitted master Strabax from wasting the family’s fortune at the whorehouse. Although he puts up a good fight at first, some chinks in his armor are soon revealed as he can’t help but stare at Astaphium during their encounter. Later he drops all opposition and joins the rest of the men in becoming completely helpless to their control.
The play is brought to a close when it is revealed that the baby Phronesium had been using actually belonged to Diniarchus. He agrees to a shotgun wedding with the mother, and goes to get the baby back from Phronesium. However, Phronesium gets her way as always and keeps the baby until she decides she no longer needs it. Diniarchus, as well as the other men, have learned nothing by the play's end.

Ibak Khan

Ibak Khan (died 1495) was a Shaybanid khan of Sibir about whom the sources are contradictory. He is also called Abak, Ivak, Ibaq, Khan of Tyumen, and Said Ibrakhim Khan(?).
With the breakup of the Golden Horde the regional powers were the Nogais south of the Urals, the Shaybanids southeast of the Urals and the Taibugas in the forested lands to the east. The last two alternated control over the Khanate of Sibir. From about 1428, the Shaybanid Abu'l-Khayr Khan killed the Siberian Khan (which one?) and established a brief empire that streatched from Sibir to the Syr Darya. As people and power drifted southeast, the remaining Shaybanids coaleased around Ibak (Allworth,p47). In 1464 (many sources), or after Abu’l Khayr’s death in 1468 (Forsyth.p25) or about 1480 (Grosset) Ibak, with the help of the Nogais, killed Mar, the Taibugid Khan, and became the Khan of Sibir.
At some date, the Nogai brothers Musa and Yamgurchi were at war and Yamgurchi invited Ibak from Tyumen. He appeared along the Volga claiming to have a better right to rule the Great Horde than Ahmed Khan (Howarth,p980). At the time of the Ugra standoff Ibak may have has some arrangement with Moscow to threaten Ahmed in the rear. In 1491 Ibak and Yamgurchi (and Musa?) killed Ahmed Khan. (Khodarkovsky in a footnote implies that there is some doubt about the details). In 1495(most common), or 1494, or 1493 (Grosset, p 489) Ibak was killed by Mamut, a grandson of Mar (Howarth,p981), who then became Khan of Sibir.
His son Murtaza was a power on the Steppe after 1502. His grandson Kuchum was the last Khan of Sibir. His younger brother Mamuk was briefly (1495–96) Khan of Kazan.

The name was originally a commercial product name but is now used to describe all such ice cream treats, whoever makes them. While definitely a delight, the frozen treat does not qualify as ice cream under USDA guidelines. 
'Two Ball Screwball' is a brand name (in the United States, a registered trademark) for a screwball containing two gumballs. The original flavor was cherry but it has also been introduced a multiple flavored twist of lemon and blue raspberry. As with all screwballs, the shape is that of an upside down cone with the gumballs at the bottom.

Pix Capri Theatre

Pix/Capri Theatre is a historical movie theater in Jackson, Mississippi. It is currently undergoing renovation and is anticipated to reopen for business in 2013. 
Built in 1939 as the Pix Theatre, on the historic US Highway 51, known as North State Street in Jackson. While many Jackson movie theaters were going strong through the 1950s, the Pix had winded down and ceased operations by 1957. In 1965, the building was sold to Cinema Guild Inc and reopened as The Capri Theatre. The Capri was initially highly successful; however, with the development of multiplex theaters in the metro Jackson market, the Capri changed formats and began relying on second run/bargain films by the late 1970s. By the early 1980s, the Capri had become a porn theater showcasing X rated films in order to remain open. In 1985, the Capri closed, although daily ads continued to appear in the Clarion Ledger Newspaperup to two months after the theater's closing. 
By 2005, after twenty years of sitting vacant, the Capri reopened as a venue for live music, independent films and live theater performances. Various groups made efforts to raise money for its restoration without success. More recently, Jackson lawyer and developer Jason Watkins has announced plans to develop the historic building into a mixed use venue including a multiscreen dinner theater.

Cuibul cu barză Church

The Cuibul cu barză Church (meaning the "Stork-nest Church") dedicated to the Saint Stephen is a Romanian Orthodox church located on Știrbei Vodă Street in Bucharest's Sector 1. As mentioned on the inscription, placed after the 1898 rehabilitation, at the entrance of the church the name is due to the nests which storks had built on the building’s shingle roof.
According to documentary evidence from the beginning of the 18th century, a small church existed on the site. A new church was built by the clucer Dona and his wife Zamfira. who were buried in the church in 1830. Their tombstones are preserved in the naos. 
The church needed frequent repairs. After the first repairs, carried out in 1853, the main dome had to be rebuilt in 1877 and in 1898, the church was completely rehabilitated by architect Toma Dobrescu. The church was repainted in neobyzantine style by Vasile Damian, a priest and painter. The pillars separating the pronaos from the nave were eliminated. A new church porch with three arches was added to the building. The church was included in the list of historic monuments.
The 1977 earthquake severely damaged the “Cuibul cu Barză” church, Consolidation works, including concrete reinforcements around the foundation and the dome were started in 1984. A mosaic was fixed on the western facade and the painting was cleaned and restored. 
After the completion of the restoration, in 1987, the church was scheduled for demolition, due to the new town planning for the Știrbei Vodă area. A group of concerned technicians under the leadership of engineer Eugen Iordăchescu, technical director of the “Proiect București” design institute were able to come with a solution of saving the church, by moving it 12 meter (40 ft) southward. The translation of the building was completed on February 22, 1988. A new high-rise was built, to hide the view of the church from the main street, the access being possible only by a narrow road from Vasile Pârvan street. The new church was reconsecrated on November 21, 1990.
A grammar school, called "Cuibul cu barză school" was built next to the church. The school was attended by: George Călinescu, Eugen Filotti, Dumitru Cornilescu and other celebrities. The school’s old building was torn down in the late 1980s and a new school, called "Music and visual arts school No. 3 – Cuibul cu Barză" was built in the neighborhood.

Rory Hume

Wyatt R. "Rory" Hume DDS, PhD (born 4 January 1945) is an Australian-born academic.
Hume graduated from the University of Adelaide with Bachelor degrees in dentistry and dental surgery, and a Ph.D. in human physiology and pharmacology. Between 1980 and 2003, Hume's dental research demonstrated how to avoid adverse effects when applying restorative materials to dental tissue.
After service as dean of dentistry at the University of Sydney and then at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) he served as UCLA's Executive Vice-Chancellor between 1998 and 2002, and then as The University of New South Wales' sixth Vice-Chancellor and President from 2002 to 2004.
Hume's term as vice-chancellor at UNSW was marked by disagreements within the university council over allegations involving medical researcher Professor Bruce Hall, who was accused of serious scientific misconduct. Hume cited the reason for his departure as 'a breakdown of his relationship with the university Council'.
Hume's handling of the Hall matter was subsequently vindicated by the independent St James Ethics Centre in a report described as 'highly critical of the UNSW council'.
Hume returned to the University of California system of ten research-intensive campuses and three National Laboratories in 2005 as Vice President for Health Affairs. In 2006 he became Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic and Health Affairs for the UC system, and then in 2007 also its Chief Operating Officer during the transition between Presidents Dynes and Yudof. He stepped down as Provost and retired from the UC system in September 2008.
From 2008 to 2012 Hume served as Provost of the United Arab Emirates University. His time at UAE University did not yield the outcomes hoped for at the time of his appointment. While promising to transform the nation's first university into a dynamic research intensive one, Dr. Hume did not receive the financial backing from the UAE Government that would support such change. The UAE federal higher education system has been starved of funds in recent years [http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/universities-to-start-year-with-dh428m-funds-shortfall.

Soprano Sax (also released as Soprano Today) is the debut album by Steve Lacy which was released on the Prestige label in 1958. It features performances by Lacy, Wynton Kelly, Buell Neidlinger and Dennis Charles.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Bob Rusch awarded the album 4.5 stars stating "This was the first of three recordings soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy made for Prestige and this 11/1/57 session was his first as a leader...There was a controlled tension to this date, like everybody's trying to play, carefully, to a common goal. It's almost as if someone were present to make sure everybody stayed within obvious perimeters.".

Abdul Subhan Qureshi

Abdul Subhan Qureshi (also Abdus Subhan) (born 1972) is a suspected bomb-maker and one of the most wanted terrorists in India and has been called India's Bin Laden. He is suspected to be associated with the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), and is thought to have been responsible for participating in the Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi bombings. He is also a suspect in the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings.
He is more commonly known as Tauqeer and is believed to be the signer in the Indian Mujahideen terror email as "al-Arabi". He is listed on the NIA Most Wanted list.
Background.
His working-class parents, Father Haji Usmaan Qureshi & Mother Zubeida Begum Qureshi who hailed from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh migrated to Mumbai. He finished his SSC (class X) from an institution run by an Islamic trust in Byculla in Mumbai. He graduated from the Antonio DeSouza High School in 1988, obtaining a good Secondary School Certificate with 76.6% marks. His sisters, Shabana, Asma and Safia, have MA Degrees, his eldest sister Farha has been a columnist in an Urdu newspaper "Inquilab" & an independent novelist, his youngest sister Hafsa, studies at Sophia college, Mumbai and none of his three well-educated brothers Imran, Numaan & Salman appear to have never been associated with SIMI.
In 1992 he began studies at the Bharatiya Vidyapeeth in Navi Mumbai. In 1995, he obtained a Diploma in Industrial Electronics, and got a part-time job at String Computers in Mazgaon. In 1996, he earned a specialised software maintenance training from the CMS Institute in Marol.
He joined Radical Solutions, a computer firm in the Fort area in South Mumbai in November 1996. According to his co-workers, Qureshi was an exceptional worker. In just three years, his salary was quadrupled. He handled several major independent projects, including an intranet for Bharat Petro-Chemicals carried out by Wipro in 1999, and then joined Datamatics.
In a 26 March 2001 letter, he resigned with a letter stating "“I wish to inform you, that I have decided to devote one complete year to pursue religious and spiritual matters.”"
Tauqeer married Arifa from Bandra in 1999 (or 2000). They moved to a flat at Mira Road in south Mumbai’s Dongri area in 2000. On 21 August 2001, he participated in a SIMI press conference. He was video-recorded sitting beside Safdar Nagori.
In 2006, he is said to have severed contact with even his wife and three children, One son & two daughter named Hanzala, Zainab and Zaweria nicknamed "Juhi".
Arrested SIMI leader Safdar Nagori, has told police that he knew Qureshi and they had attended a religious function in Delhi in 2000. Nagori has also told them that Qureshi attended a two-day SIMI meeting in Karnataka's Hubli and another SIMI meet at a Kerala forest in October 2007.
Police claims.
According to the Mumbai police investigators, by 1998, he appears to have been a committed SIMI activist. He was charged that year with defacing public property by pasting SIMI posters. Later, he edited SIMI’s magazine, the Islamic Voice, from New Delhi.
Police sources told The Hindu that he participated in the October,1999 SIMI conference where Sheikh Yasin, the head of the Hamas and the Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad, were among those who delivered speeches through a telephone network.
In SIMI’s 1999 Aurangabad convention which Qureshi is believed to have helped organize, many of the speeches delivered by delegates are reported to have been inflammatory. "“Islam is our nation, not India,”" said Mohammad Amir Shakeel Ahmad, one of the SIMI-linked Lashkar operatives arrested in 2005 for smuggling in military-grade explosives and assault rifles for a supposed planned series of attacks in Gujarat.
Qureshi is thought to have been one of the principal organisers of SIMI’s last public conference in 2001 where SIMI leaders told the estimated 25,000 members that the time had come for Indian Muslims to launch an armed Jihad which would have the establishment of a Caliphate as its final aim.
It is believed that finding Qureshi - as well as individuals like Qayamuddin Kapadia, the missing Vadodara based computer-graphics artist - could be instrumental in preventing the next big terror attack.
Defense by Family.
On 17 September 2008, his family held a press-conference in Mumbai. His mother Zubeda Qureshi claimed that she had not seen her son in seven years and did not think he was involved. She said if he was guilty, he should be hanged.
The family lawyer Mubin Solkar however stated that the family does not wish to defend him and will cooperate with the administration.
The press conference included representatives of Ekta Welfare Association, Maharashtra Legal Aid Forum and Movement for Peace and Justice, and 17 Muslim organisations (including Editor-Publisher of The Hindustan Daily Urdu Sarfaraz Arzu). The Muslim organisations termed the charges against him as a conspiracy theory by the Sangh Parivar.

Latham 43

__NOTOC__
The Latham 43 was a flying boat bomber built in France in the 1920s for service with the French Navy. It was a conventional design for its day - a two-bay biplane with unstaggered wings, and engines mounted tractor-fashion on struts in the interplane gap. The pilot sat in an open cockpit, with a gunner in an open bow position, and another in an open position amidships.
Two examples, designated Latham 42 powered by liquid-cooled Vee engines were evaluated by the navy in 1924, leading to a contract for 18 aircraft powered by air-cooled radial engines instead. Designated Latham 43 by the manufacturer and HB.3 in naval service (for "Hydravion de bombardement" - "Seaplane-bomber", 3 seats), they remained in service between 1926 and 1929.
Eight other machines with the original liquid-cooled engine were sold to Poland.

Castle of Gallifa

The Castle of Gallifa is found on the plain that accommodates Gallifa, a small village of Catalonia. It is a small fortification that was the historical and jurisdictional center of the village in the Middle Ages. 
Description.
The castle is on a high hill and comprises defensive walls around a plateau with portals on the west and east side, both of them with look-out towers.
History.
In recent excavations Iberian walls were found from the 8th century BC that indicate a stable settlement in the territory. The first documentation of the castle is from 999 CE.
Originally, the castle belonged to the count of Barcelona and was controlled by the Gallifa family, a name they adopted from the castle. They are documented from 1060 with Ramon, son of Adaltrudis, married to Rodlendis. He was followed by his son, Bernat Ramon de Gallifa, who was also a Castilian of the castle of Clarà, in Moia. Bernat Ramon died about 1115 and the castle was jointly inherited by his son Ramon Bernat, who was also Castilian of Maçanet, and his daughter Rodlendis, who was married to Guillem Humbert de Rocafort. In 1348 the lord of the castle was Bernardo de Guasius de Petra. Between 1357 and 1564 it was occupied by the Centelles family. Around that time the people from Gallifa bought their freedom from taxation from King Philip II of Spain for 10,000 "sous". The castle was no longer used as a fortress by the 16th century, and became the center of the parish of "Santa Maria del Castell" ("Saint Mary of the Castle").
Santa Maria del Castell.
The Romanesque church of "Santa Maria del Castell" ("Saint Mary of the Castle") from the 11th century is built at high point inside the castle and is documented from 1060. It is a single nave plan with an apse and an upper fortified floor with an embrasure built by the 14th century as a last resort for the inhabitants of the castle. Until 1860 it was parish seat of part of the area, sharing this function with the church of Gallifa.
The original image of Santa Maria del Castell, dating from the 19th century, was ruined during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).
Ecological sanctuary.
In 1985, the priest of Gallifa, Josep Dalmau, started the reconstruction of the Romanesque hermitage. As the hermitage had no image, the collector Jesús Prujà offered an image of a Virgin from the 11th century, which he had found in the loft of a farmhouse near Olot, acting as a buttress on the framework of the roof. The name and origin of the saint are not known. The priest Dalmau accepted it, renaming it with the dedication "Mare de Déu de l´Ecologia" ("Mother of God of the Ecology").
Once the church was restored, the place was converted into a meeting space for the defense of ecological values from a Christian perspective. In the perimeter of the ancient castle there is a park with several icons to the value of ecology, climbing, and mountaineering.

List of fatal World Rally Championship accidents

The list of fatal World Rally Championship accidents consists of drivers and co-drivers who have died at FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) rallies. The list also includes fatal accidents in the International Championship for Manufacturers (IMC), the predecessor to the World Rally Championship, which was contested from 1970 to 1972. Well-known fatalities involving officials, spectators and team members are also mentioned.
The fatal accidents of the Group B era resulted in its demise. Only hours after Henri Toivonen's crash at the 1986 Tour de Corse, FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre announced that Group B cars were banned for the 1987 season. However, driver fatalities peaked in 1989, when five competitors died in the first three rallies of the season. Markko Märtin's co-driver Michael Park's death at the 2005 Wales Rally GB was the WRC's first fatality in over eleven years.
Other fatalities.
Team members.
At the 1975 Safari Rally, a service car with four mechanics crashed into a parked truck near Mombasa. Carlino Dacista, Bian Fernandez and Willie Uis died instantly. The driver David Joshi sustained serious injuries. At the 1978 Monte Carlo Rally, two mechanics, Bernard Balmer and Georges Reinier, died when their van collided with a truck near Gap, Hautes-Alpes. On the second day of the 1987 Rallye Côte d'Ivoire, Toyota Team Europe's Cessna 340 crashed and exploded, killing all four inside; manager and former co-driver Henry Liddon, his assistant Nigel Harris, the pilot and the navigator. Team manager Ove Andersson withdrew Toyota from the event. Prior to the accident, Björn Waldegård and Fred Gallagher had been running second in their Toyota Supra Turbo. At the 1996 Safari Rally, competed in bad weather and rain, three British mechanics drowned while attempting to cross a river with their Land Rover.
Officials.
At the end of the fourth stage of the 1981 1000 Lakes Rally, Audi Sport driver Franz Wittmann and his co-driver Kurt Nestinger did not notice the flying finish which marks the end of the stage. They continued at race speed with their Quattro and crashed into a group of people standing in front of a van. Raul Falin, chairman of AKK, Finland's sporting authority for motorsport and the country's representative in the FIA, was quickly taken to a hospital but died from his injuries soon after. Boris Rung, co-founder and chairman of the European Rallycross Association and member of FIA's Off-Road Commission, survived the accident along with Greek FIA observer Costas Glossotis.
Spectators.
At the 1978 Safari Rally, five by-passers and four spectators were killed in unrelated accidents, both involving non-competitive drivers crashing into competitors.
On the first stage of the 1986 Rally Portugal, Joaquim Santos lost control of his Ford RS200 while trying to avoid spectators on the road, crashing into a "human wall" of spectators, killing three and injuring over thirty. All the factory teams – Audi, Austin Rover, Ford, Lancia, Peugeot and Volkswagen – withdrew from the event.
At the 1995 Rally of the Thousand Lakes, at a special stage "Hassi" one spectator died when Belgian Bruno Thiry, driving 0-car, ran over her. According to some reports the spectator was unable to hear Thiry's car coming because of the crowd noise and relatively low sound of the car compared to full WRC vehicles.
At the 1996 Rally of the Thousand Lakes, at the famous special stage "Harju" that took place in the centrum of "Rally Capital" Jyväskylä, one spectator died and 36 injured when Danish Kristen Rikhard lost control of his Mitsubishi Lancer due to too high speed and wrong driving line. Rikhard, car number 65, reached the curve at 120 km/h (approximately 75 mph), finally hitting the crowd at 40 km/h although the audience had placed within safe distance to road.

Reflections (Steve Lacy album)

Reflections (subtitled "Steve Lacy Plays Thelonious Monk") is the second album by Steve Lacy which was released on the Prestige label in 1959. It features performances of Thelonious Monk's compositions by Lacy, Mal Waldron, Buell Neidlinger and Elvin Jones. (According to biographer Robin Kelley, this was the first album devoted entirely to Monk's music recorded by another artist.)
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars stating "All of soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy's early recordings are quite fascinating, for during 1957-1964, aspects of his style at times hinted at Dixieland, swing, Monk, and Cecil Taylor, sometimes at the same time. For this CD reissue (a straight reproduction of the original New Jazz LP), Lacy teams up with pianist Mal Waldron, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and drummer Elvin Jones for seven Thelonious Monk compositions. The typical standbys (such as "'Round Midnight," "Straight No Chaser," and "Blue Monk") are avoided in favor of more complex works such as "Four in One," "Bye-Ya," and "Skippy"; the sweet ballad "Ask Me Now" is a highpoint. Lacy always had an affinity for Monk's music and, even nearly 40 years later, this set is a delight.".

Collinsville Soccer Complex

Collinsville Soccer Complex, also known as The Fields was a planned soccer-centered development to be located in Collinsville, Illinois, United States. The centerpiece of the complex was a 18,500-seat soccer-specific stadium that would have been the home stadium for professional soccer clubs in MLS and WPS based in the St. Louis area. The plan also included eight FIFA-approved artificial turf fields, as well as mixed-use development, which included retail, office, entertainment, educational, and residential areas. The entire development was valued at almost $600 million.
The proposed stadium location was roughly ten minutes away from downtown St. Louis, by the I-255/I-70/I-55 interchange.
All plans to begin construction had been in place, and the city of Collinsville had approved the project. Construction never began because MLS never awarded a franchise to St. Louis Soccer United (AC St. Louis), the ownership group that had spearheaded the professional soccer effort in St. Louis; although the city of Collinsville had approved of the plans, construction was not approved until a MLS team was guaranteed. Also, there were several homeowners who had not yet sold their property. As such, Saint Louis Athletica, the area's WPS team, began the league's first season in 2009 at Ralph Korte Stadium in Edwardsville, Illinois, but moved across the Mississippi River during the season to the Anheuser-Busch Center in Fenton, Missouri.

The Straight Horn of Steve Lacy

The Straight Horn of Steve Lacy is the third album by Steve Lacy and the first to be released on the Candid label in 1961. It features performances of tunes written by Thelonious Monk, Cecil Taylor and Miles Davis by Lacy, Charles Davis, John Ore and Roy Haynes.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 5 stars stating "Some of soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy's most interesting recordings are his earliest ones. After spending periods of time playing with Dixieland groups and then with Cecil Taylor (which was quite a jump), Lacy made several recordings that displayed his love of Thelonious Monk's music plus his varied experiences. On this particular set, Lacy's soprano contrasts well with Charles Davis' baritone (they are backed by bassist John Ore and drummer Roy Haynes) on three of the most difficult Monk tunes ("Introspection," "Played Twice," and "Criss Cross") plus two Cecil Taylor compositions and Charlie Parker's "Donna Lee."".

Lederlin 380L

__NOTOC__
The Lederlin 380L (marketed in North America as the Ladybug) is an unconventional light aircraft developed in France in the 1960s, and marketed for homebuilding.
Development.
François Lederlin developed the 380L from the Mignet HM.380 "Flying Flea", and eventually created a new aircraft sharing only its choice of wing profile and general configuration.
Like the Pou-du-Ciel, the 380L is a tandem wing design, with the forward wing mounted on a set of cabane struts forward of the cockpit, and designed to pivot in flight, to vary its angle of incidence. Otherwise, it is unlike the original Mignet HM.14, having side-by-side seating for two in a fully enclosed cockpit, and a neatly cowled engine. The fuselage is of steel tube construction, metal-skinned at the front and fabric-covered to the rear, and the wings have fabric-covered wooden structure. The tailwheel undercarriage is fixed.

Boyd Theatre

The Boyd Theatre is a 1920s era movie palace in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It operated as a movie theater for 74 years, operating under the name Sameric as part of the United Artists theater chain, before closing in 2002. The theater is the last of its kind in downtown Philadelphia, a remnant of an era of theaters and movie palaces that stretched along Market and Chestnut Streets. The theater is currently owned by Live Nation.
History.
The Boyd was designed by Philadelphia architecture firm Hoffman-Henon and built for Alexander R. Boyd. It opened on Christmas Day 1928. Boasting an opulent Art Deco lobby, extravagant marquee and ticket booth and a 2,450 seat auditorium that featured a screen advertised as 'the largest in Philadelphia', the theater became well known among several others along Chestnut Street. It was home to several notable first run films such as "The Wizard of Oz" in 1939 and "Gone with the Wind" in 1940. Grace Kelly was present for the premiere of "High Noon" in 1952, in which she appeared. The theater is located at 1908 Chestnut Street.
The theater, which had been owned by Warner Bros. since shortly after its opening, was sold to The SamEric Corporation in 1971 and renamed The Sameric. The following decade, three smaller screens were added to the theater on a parcel immediately west and was renamed Sameric 4. Shortly thereafter, in 1988, the theater was sold to the United Artists Circuit.
In 1993, the theater hosted its final gala event - the world premiere of Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia", which he and film co-stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington attended. Tom Hanks was reportedly amazed by the theater, exclaiming "Wow, a real movie palace!"
In the subsequent years the theater became a shadow of its former self, falling into great disrepair both inside and out. By the mid 1990s, the theater became the only first-run multiplex and last non-art house movie theater in Center City. The property was purchased from United Artists in 1998 by the Philadelphia development firm The Goldenberg Group and the theater continued showing films until its last day of operation on May 2, 2002.
The Clear Channel period.
The fate of The Boyd remained uncertain for the years following its closing. Its owners, The Goldenberg Group, obtained a permit to demolish it shortly after its final show. In June 2002, a group of local preservationists and private citizens organized The Committee to Save the Sameric in order to persuade the owner not to demolish the structure and local government to intercede to preserve Philadelphia's sole surviving movie palace. Their cause was bolstered the following month when Preservation Pennsylvania, a statewide preservationist group, declared The Boyd as one of Pennsylvania's ten most endangered historic properties. Later in September 2002, The Committee to Save the Sameric incorporated as a non-profit organization, Friends of The Boyd.
The property was not demolished and was purchased by Clear Channel in 2005 with the intention of expanding the theater for live productions and shoring up the building's deteriorating facade and period features. Although the restorative work was begun and the rights to an adjacent parking lot had been obtained, high costs had become a factor for the new owner, Live Nation, an independent company that was spun off of Clear Channel's theater operations and work ceased in 2006. Today, the theater remains shuttered; however the addition to the building which contained the three small theaters has since been turned into retail.
2008 & Beyond.
The cause for restoring and renovating the theater was bolstered by three announcements in 2008.
In March, The Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia listed The Boyd in its Annual Endangered Properties List and two months later The National Trust for Historic Preservation named The Boyd on its 2008 List of America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places and in August it was listed on The Philadelphia Register of Historic Places after some contention based on the building's interior not being eligible for historic protection under the rules for the Register as the exterior is.
In September, Philadelphia development firm ARCWheeler entered into an agreement with Live Nation to purchase the theater and announced plans to restore it into a live performance venue with two restaurants and plans for a 30-story Kimpton Hotel on the adjacent parking lot.
Unfortunately, not having completed the purchase of the Boyd Theatre, in January 2010, Hal Wheeler died.

Tuman bay II

Al-Ashraf Tuman bay better known as Tuman bay II succeeded as Sultan of Egypt during the final period of Mamluk rule in Egypt prior to its conquest by the Ottoman Empire. He ascended the sultanic throne after the defeat of his predecessor Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri by Ottoman Sultan Selim I at the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 CE.
As a Circassian, like his predecessors having been in early youth a domestic slave of the palace, he gradually rose to be emir of a hundred, and then prime minister, an office he held until the departure of Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri, who left him in charge of Cairo. The Caliph Muhammad Al-Mutawakkil III having remained behind with Selim I after defeat of Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri, Tuman bay II was now inaugurated as sultan, but without pomp or ceremony, the royal insignia having been lost in battle. It was a dark and thankless dignity to which, now at the age of 40, he was called; Syria gone, the troops in disorder, the emirs distracted, the Mamluks a mercenary horde. Yet he ruled well for the time he held the throne, and was popular throughout the land. In course of time, the fugitive chiefs, with Emir Janberdi Al-Ghazali, arrived from Damascus; but another month elapsed before an army could be organized.
Gaza Campaign 1516 CE.
Meanwhile, Tripoli, Safed and other Syrian strongholds, besides Damascus, had fallen into Ottoman hands. It was thus the beginning of December before the force now raised at Cairo, delayed and diminished by the insatiable demands and waywardness of the Mamluks, set out under Emir Janberdi Al-Ghazali in the forlorn hope of saving Gaza; but before it reached its destination, Gaza had already fallen, and the army was beaten back. During Emir Janberdi Al-Ghazali’s absence an Embassy arrived with a dispatch from Selim I who, boasting of his victories, and the adhesion of the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil III, Judges and other leaders who had joined him, demanded of the Sultan that his supremacy should be acknowledged both in the Coinage and the public Prayers He said;
Though the Envoy and his followers were hooted and mishandled in the City, Sultan Tuman bay II was inclined to fall in with the Selim I's demand; but his infatuated Emirs overcame his better judgment, and the Ottoman messengers were put to death. Tidings of disaster now followed rapidly on one another. Terror and dismay pervaded the Cairo. The treachery of Khayr Baig and many other Emirs made the prospect all the darker. The inhabitants of Gaza having, on a false report of Egyptian victory, attacked the Turkish garrison, where by Selim's order in great numbers massacred.The news of Emir Janberdi Al-Ghazali’s discomfiture increased the gloom ; the more so as he himself, shortly after appearing, attributed the defeat not only to the numbers of the enemy, but to the cowardice of his mercenary followers, while even his own loyalty began to be suspected.
Battle of Ridanieh.
Sultan Tuman bay II now resolved himself to march out as far as "Salahia", and there meet the Turks wearied by the desert march; but at the last yielded to his Emirs who entrenched themselves at Ridanieh a little way out of the city. By this time, the Ottomans having reached Arish, were marching unopposed by Salahia and Bilbeis to Khanqah; and on January 20 reached Birkat al Hajj, a few hours from the Capital. Two days later the main body confronted the Egyptian entrenchment; while a party crossing the Mocattam hill took them in the flank. Battle of Ridanieh was fought January 22, 1517. Sultan Tuman bay II fought bravely. With a band of devoted followers, he threw himself into the midst of the Turkish ranks, and reached even to Selim's tent. But in the end the Egyptians were routed, and fled two miles up the Nile. The Ottomans then entered the City of Cairo unopposed. They took the Citadel and slew the entire Circassian garrison, while all around the streets became the scene of terrible outrage.Selim I himself occupied an island close to Bulac. The following day his Vizier, entering the city, endeavored to stop the wild rapine of the troops ; and the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil III, who had followed in Selim's train, led the Public service invoking blessing on his name. The Caliph's prayer is thus given by Ibn Ayas;
The following night,Sultan Tuman bay II reappeared and with his Bedouin allies took possession of the weakly garrisoned city, and at daylight drove back the Ottomans with great loss. The approaches were entrenched, and the Friday service once more solemnized in name of the Egyptian Sultan. But at midnight the enemy again returned in overpowering force, scattered the Mamluks into their hiding-places, while the Sultan fled across the Nile to Giza, and eventually found refuge in Upper Egypt.
Satisfied with this victory, Selim I returning again to his island had a red and white flag in token of amnesty hoisted over his tent. The Mamluks, however, were excluded from it. They were ruthlessly pursued, proclamation made that any sheltering them would be put to death, and 800 thus discovered were beheaded. Many citizens were spared at the entreaty of the Caliph, who now occupied a more prominent place than ever under the Egyptian Sultanate. The son of Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri was received with distinction and granted the College founded by the Sultan his father as a dwelling-place.
Soon after, the amnesty was extended to all the hidden Emirs, who as they appeared were upbraided by Selim I, and then distributed in cells throughout the Citadel. Emir Janberdi Al-Ghazali who fought bravely at the Battle of Ridanieh, but now cast himself at Selim's feet, was alone received with honor and even given a command to fight against the Bedouins. There is a great diversity of opinion as to when Janberdi either openly or by collusion took the Turkish side. The presumption is that he was faithful up to the Battle of Ridanieh, and then seeing the cause hopeless retired and went over to the Ottomans about the end of January. Having strongly garrisoned the Citadel, Selim I now took up his residence there, and for security had a detachment quartered at foot of the great entrance gate.
Guerrilla Campaign from Giza.
SultanTuman bay II had again assumed the offensive. Well supported by Mamluks and Bedouins, he had taken up a threatening attitude there, and stopped the supplies from Upper Egypt. At the last, however, wearied with the continued struggle, he made advances, and offered to recognize Selim I’s supremacy if the invaders would retire. Selim thereupon commissioned the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil III with the four Qadis to accompany a Turkish deputation for the purpose of arranging terms; but the Caliph disliking the duty sent his Deputy instead. When Tuman bay II heard the conditions offered, he would gladly have accepted them; but was overruled by his Emirs, who distrusting Selim I, slew the Turkish members of the Embassy with one of the Qadis, and thus stopped negotiations.Selim I upon this revenged himself by the equally savage act of putting to death the Emirs imprisoned in the Citadel to the number of 57.
Sultan Tuman bay II who had still a considerable following now returned to Giza ; and Selim I, finding difficulty in the passage of his troops, was obliged to build a bridge of boats across the Nile. Tuman bay II gathered his forces under the Pyramids of Giza, and there, towards the end of March, the two armies met. Though well supported by his General Shadi Baig he was, after two days' fighting, beaten, and sought refuge with a Bedouin Chief whose life he once had saved, but who now ungratefully betrayed him into Turkish hands. He was carried in fetters into Selim I's presence, who upbraided him for his obstinate hostility and the murder of his messengers.
Capture and Death.
The captive Sultan held a noble front; he denied complicity in the murder, and spoke out so fearlessly on the justice of his cause and duty to fight for the honor and independence of his people, that Selim I was inclined to spare him, and carry him in his train to Constantinople. But the traitor Khayr Baig, and even Janberdi Al-Ghazali, urged that so long as he survived, the Ottoman rule would be in jeopardy. The argument was specious ; and so the unfortunate Tuman bay II was cast into prison, and shortly after, hung up as a malefactor at the City gate on April 15, 1517. The body remained suspended thus three days, and then was buried.
General Shadi Baig, similarly betrayed, was at the same time put to death. The sad death of Sultan Tuman bay II created such a sensation that an attempt was made by an Emir and a body of devoted followers to assassinate Selim I by night. But the Palace guard was on the alert, or the desperate design might have succeeded. Tuman bay II, forty years of age, had reigned but three months and a half. He left no family; his widow, a daughter of Akbercly, was tortured for her treasure.
Both as Governor during Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri’s absence, and during his own short Sultanate, he proved himself brave, generous and just, and his death was mourned throughout the land. Last of the race he was one of the best. And so with the death of Tuman bay II, the Mamluk dynasty came to its tragic end.
As late as 1968, some Copts still observed the anniversary of Tuman's death as "Holy Friday."2

The Forbidden Tower

The Forbidden Tower is a fantasy novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley in her Darkover series. It was originally published by DAW Books (No. 256) in 1977. It is the sequel to "The Spell Sword" and is followed by "The Bloody Sun". The major characters also appear in "Thendara House" and "City of Sorcery".
This book is set approximately forty years after the events in the book "Rediscovery". The Hilary Castamir stories in Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover precede The Forbidden Tower by about ten years. 
Plot Summary.
On the road to Armida, Damon Ridenow encounters Leonie Hastur, Keeper of Arilinn. Leonie tells him that she wishes to persuade Callista Lanart to return to Arilinn Tower and replace her as Keeper. She is aware that Callista wishes to marry the Terran, Andrew Carr, who rescued her from the Caves of Corresanti (see "The Spell Sword"). After they arrive, Leonie meets with Callista and unable to persuade her to return, releases her from her Keeper’s vow. Dom Esteban, Callista’s father, consents to her marriage. The next day, a joint wedding is held – Ellemir is joined to Damon and Callista to Andrew in freemate marriage. 
Andrew recalls that Leonie has warned him that Callista was trained in the old ways of Keepers, and may not be able to consummate their relationship for a long time. Ellemir has a premonition of her father’s death. Desiderio Leynier, a nedestro relation, creates trouble at the wedding feast. 
Guardsmen who have been caught in a blizzard are brought to Armida. When it becomes clear that some of the men will lose their feet to frostbite, Damon, working with Andrew and Dezi, uses his laran powers to restore their circulation. The experience causes Damon to feel that laran-based healing should be available to all Darkovans, not restricted to the cloistered residents of the Towers. He reflects that it’s commonly believed that this would bring back the Ages of Chaos.
Callista agrees to share Andrew’s bed. They become telepathically aware of the lovemaking of Damon and Ellemir. When Andrew accidentally breaks the link, Callista’s Keeper training cuts in and Andrew takes the full blast of her laran. Damon comes to realize that Leonie has tampered with Callista’s channels before she reached puberty – the “old ways” that Leonie had warned him about.
Andrew is overwhelmed the experiences of the past day and walks out into the courtyard to think. He is overcome by a compulsion to leave Armida, and wanders out into the snow. Damon realizes that Dezi has overpowered Andrew telepathically and driven him away. After Andrew is rescued, Dom Esteban tells Damon that “there is bad blood” in Dezi. Damon strips Dezi of his matrix.
Damon decides to attempt timesearch – to contact Keepers in other times via the Overworld. He meets the legendary Varzil the Good of Neskaya. Varzil recommends the sacrament of Year’s End as a way of freeing Callista from her Keeper’s restrictions, but the meaning of the ritual has been lost.
Dom Esteban has premonitions of evil menacing his son, Domenic. That night, Callista wakes from a dream in which Domenic has come to harm. A guardsman arrives at Armina to inform Dom Esteban that Domenic has died during sword practice. Callista believes that he has been murdered.
Dom Esteban designates his youngest son, Valdir-Lewis Lanart-Alton to be his heir. He designates Damon Ridenow as Regent of Alton. Damon discovers that Dezi has taken Domenic’s matrix while he lay injured, thus killing Domenic, and rekeyed it to himself. Callista uses her ability to take Domenic’s matrix away from Dezi. He dies as a result.
Damon realizes that their actions constitute an unofficial matrix circle – a forbidden tower. Leonie Hastur informs him that she will bring charges in council regarding his illegal matrix work. The two couples confront the council. Leonie challenges Damon to a duel between Arilinn Tower and the Forbidden Tower.
Damon breaks down the remaining emotional walls separating the two couples, realizing that essence of the sacrament of Year’s End is a shared sexual experience under the influence of kireseth flowers. Callista and Andrew finally consummate their marriage.
At dawn, they enter into the Overworld and build their tower. After a prolonged battle with Arilinn, Damon asks for a truce. He tells Leonie that they have rediscovered the old way of working, where a Keeper need not be a cloistered virgin. He realizes that Leonie herself was trained in the old ways, and mourns for her loss. Leonie acknowledges Damon’s right to keep his tower.
The two couples return to Armida.
Significance.
Like the Darkover-Renunciate books, what underlies "The Forbidden Tower" is a discussion of the value of monogamy, women's roles in society, the place of one's family in decision making, and whether a woman may act as an agent independent of these forces. In the books that follow, particularly The Bloody Sun, Bradley acknowledges that the reaction of a traditional society to unwanted progress is often a retreat to more traditionalism and violence.

Lars-Erik Torph

Lars-Erik Torph (January 11, 1961 – January 23, 1989) was a Swedish rally driver. He debuted in the World Rally Championship in 1980 and took his first points at his home event, the Swedish Rally, in 1984. Driving a Toyota Celica TCT, a Toyota Supra 3.0i and an Audi Coupé Quattro, he went on to finish on the podium four times. After just turning 28, Torph and his co-driver Bertil-Rune Rehnfeldt died while spectating the 1989 Monte Carlo Rally, after Lancia driver Alex Fiorio lost control of his Delta Integrale and crashed into them.
Career.
Torph debuted in the World Rally Championship during the 1980 season, competing with a Volvo 142 at the Swedish Rally and at the 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland, retiring in both events. At his seventh WRC event, the 1984 Swedish Rally, he took his first WRC points by finishing fifth in an Opel Ascona for the Opel Team Sweden. In 1985, Torph drove to 11th place at his home event and then placed in the points at the 1000 Lakes Rally, taking ninth place in a Volkswagen Golf GTI for the Swedish Junior Team.
In the 1986 season, Torph competed in three rallies for Toyota Team Europe, Toyota's factory WRC team. He took his Toyota Celica TCT to second place at the endurance events Safari Rally and Rallye Côte d'Ivoire, losing the wins to compatriot and teammate Björn Waldegård. At the Olympus Rally, Torph finished fourth, but this time ahead of Waldegård who took fifth place. Points from these events placed Torph sixth in drivers' world championship.
In 1987, Torph again had a three-event contract with Toyota. He started his season at the Swedish Rally and finished 11th in his privateer Audi 80 Quattro. With a factory Toyota Supra 3.0i, he finished third at the Safari Rally behind Audi Sport's Hannu Mikkola and Walter Röhrl, despite a fever that lasted almost the duration of the event. At the Olympus Rally, he retired due to an engine problem. On the second day of the Rallye Côte d'Ivoire, Toyota's Cessna 340 aircraft crashed down and exploded, killing manager Henry Liddon, his assistant Nigel Harris, the pilot and the navigator. Toyota boss Ove Andersson withdrew all the factory Supra Turbos from the event.
During the 1988 season, Torph participated in only two WRC events. In Sweden, driving a privateer Audi Coupé Quattro, he took his fourth podium place finishing behind Markku Alén and Stig Blomqvist. For the Safari Rally, Torph had a factory team contract with Volkswagen but retired after his Golf GTI 16V developed an engine problem. Torph continued with the Coupé Quattro for the Team VAG Sweden in the 1989 season opener in Sweden, but retired after an ignition problem.
Death.
At the 1989 Monte Carlo Rally, Torph was not competing but only doing the reconnaissance ("recce") to help fellow Swedish rally driver Fredrik Skoghag regarding pacenotes on icy surface. While taking a break from recce duties, Torph and his co-driver Bertil-Rune Rehnfeldt went to spectate the fifth stage of the rally. Italian driver Alex Fiorio lost control of his Lancia Delta Integrale, and then regained it only to go off the road and down an embankment on the other side. At about 145 km/h (90 mph), the car crashed into Torph and Rehnfeldt, killing both. Fiorio and his co-driver Luigi Pirollo were unhurt. Witnesses said that hitting a bump had caused Fiorio to lose control of his car. Skoghag withdrew from the event, and Lancia's factory team Martini Lancia took a triple win with drivers Miki Biasion, Didier Auriol and Bruno Saby.

<doc id="19368449" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19368449" title="Oklahoma Water Resources Board">
Oklahoma Water Resources Board

The Oklahoma Water Resources Board (OWRB) is an agency in the government of Oklahoma under the Governor of Oklahoma. OWRB is responsible for managing and protection the water resources of Oklahoma as well as for planning for the state's long-range water needs. The Board is composed of nine members appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Oklahoma Senate. The Board, in turn, appoints an Executive Director to administer the agency.
Leadership.
The Water Resources Board is overseen by the Secretary of Energy and Environment. Under Governor Mary Fallin, Michael Teague is serving as the Secretary.
Oklahoma Water Rights.
Oklahoma has a unique set of water rights statues based on groundwater and streamwater. The owner of land owns the groundwater underlying such land and surface water standing on the land, however the Oklahoma Water Resources Board regulates non-domestic use. Stream water is considered to be publicly owned and subject to appropriation by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board.
Streamwater.
In Oklahoma, streamwater is defined to include “water in ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and playa lakes” (or dry lakes). Streamwater is considered to be publicly owned; the Oklahoma Water Resources board is responsible for appropriation for all areas of the State of Oklahoma except the Grand River basin, where the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) has responsibility for allocation on a use-it or lose-it basis.
Groundwater.
Groundwater is considered a property right in Oklahoma, and defined as “fresh water (less than 5,000 parts per million total dissolved solids) under the surface of the earth regardless of geologic structure in which it is standing or moving outside the cut bank of any definite stream” Oklahoma Water Resources Board permits the withdrawal of groundwater on a use-it or lose-it basis. 
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has jurisdiction over taking, using or disposal of salt water associated with the exploration, production or recovery of oil and gas or to the taking, using or disposal of water trapped in producing mines.
Domestic Use.
The Domestic Use of either Groundwater or Streamwater is exempt from permitting. Domestic use is defined as being use by individuals “for household purposes, lawns, orchards, and cattle watering up to the normal grazing capacity, plus use of up to 5 acre-feed per year for agricultural my natural individuals, firefighting, and use by non-individuals for drinking water, restrooms, and lawn watering.
Federal Authority.
The U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause gives the Federal Government the authority to regulate commerce among the States. This power impacts water used in Oklahoma for both navigation and for generating Hydropower. 
However, a federal appeals court ruled on whether the Oklahoma laws violate the Commerce Clause. The finding was that the laws do not violate the clause.
Texas—Oklahoma laws favoring in-state applicants for water permits were authorized by Congress when it approved an interstate water compact, a federal appeals court has ruled (Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann, 10th Cir., No. 10-6184, 9/7/11). Because the Red River Compact, (which apportions rights to water from the Red River among Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana) was approved by Congress, the Oklahoma statutes did not violate the “dormant” commerce clause, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit concluded in its decision of Sept. 7 2011.
The dormant commerce clause refers to previous judicial interpretations that states cannot limit interstate commerce even in matters in which Congress has not acted. By approving the compact, which the court said “explicitly defers to and recognizes plenary state authority over water use,” Congress gave the states “broad regulatory authority” in “unqualified terms,” allowing Oklahoma to put restrictions on interstate water transactions.
The appeals court also rejected claims by the Tarrant Regional Water District, an agency that provides water in north central Texas, that specific language in the compact intended to ensure that downstream states receive their fair share of water in dry years did not preempt the Oklahoma laws. It affirmed a lower court ruling.
Navigation.
Because waterways are used to transport goods among the States, while States may claim ownership of the beds of rivers based on the Equal footing doctrine, the Commerce clause established a “Navigable servitude” on all lands and on all state-created water rights allowing Congress to enact laws that have the effect of overriding state laws on water use. This “navigation servitude” is described to exist on lands and water up to the “ordinary high water mark” of streams that are navigable.
Hydropower.
The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution has also been interpreted to allow Congress to regulate water used for Hydropower purposes and a state can not refuse to block a hydro-project by refusing to issue a water permit, with the exception being through the Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. -- a state may withhold a water quality certification for the federal hydropower license.
Interstate Stream Compacts.
The entire state of Oklahoma is covered by four separate interstate compacts concerning all surface water that flows into or out of the state. These interstate compacts are agreements written by impacted states and approved by the United States Congress. The compacts are the equivalent to treaties between the states in that the rules and regulations of a Compact Commission (the administrative agency set up to administer the agreements) have the full impact of federal law. 
Arkansas Riverbed Authority.
As the result of a Supreme Court Decision, it was decided that three of the tribes of Indian Territory were the owners of a portion of the Arkansas River bed. The Arkansas Riverbed Authority is an entity created jointly by the Chickasaw, Choctaw and Cherokee Nations to administer the tribally owned stretch of the Arkansas River between Muskogee Oklahoma, and Ft. Smith, Arkansas. To settle pending damage claims, the Congress passed the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations Claims Settlement Act,
While the original Supreme Court Decision dealt with mineral rights under the river bed, aspects of the case may impact water rights in the State of Oklahoma.
History.
Created in 1957, the nine-member Board is composed of one member from each of five congressional districts, with the remaining members-at-large. Members serve seven-year terms. Members represent recreational, industrial, irrigation, municipal, agricultural, soil conservation, and rural residential water uses. The Board administers financial assistance programs to fund eligible public water supply and wastewater treatment projects and improvements. The Board also administers water use permits, the water well drillers licensing program, dam safety, floodplain management programs, the Clean Lakes program, and promulgates state water quality standards.
Staffing.
The Water Resources Board, with an annual budget of about $20 million, is one of the smaller employers of the State. For fiscal year 2011, the Board was authorized 101 full-time employees.

Wartime Information Security Program

The Wartime Information Security Program (abbreviated WISP) was a Cold War-era group that would have been responsible for censorship in the aftermath of a nuclear war. In such a situation, emergency powers would grant this group of eight officials authority over all United States media and all other communications that entered or left the country.
The members of WISP and their support staff would take refuge and operate out of a specially-constructed bunker in the basement of an academic building at McDaniel College, Maryland. The several-thousand-square-foot bunker space was relinquished back to the college around 1990.
The group was originally created as the United State Office of Censorship under President Dwight David Eisenhower, but was later renamed to avoid negative connotations associated with the word "censorship".

Cui Ning

Cui Ning (崔寧) (723 – November 10, 783), né Cui Gan (崔旰), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. For over a decade, he ruled over Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) effectively independently from the imperial government, but was eventually kept at the capital Chang'an by the imperial government in 779. Subsequently, when the general Zhu Ci rebelled in 783 and established a new state of Qin, the chancellor Lu Qi, apprehensive that Cui would blame the rebellion on him, falsely accused Cui of being complicit in Zhu's rebellion. Emperor Dezong, believing Lu's accusations, had Cui strangled.
Background.
Cui Gan was born in 723, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Wei Prefecture (衛州, in modern Puyang, Henan), and had a long tradition of Confucian scholarship. Despite this, though, Cui Gang was interested in military strategies. At one point, Ru Zhang (茹璋) the prefect of Wei Prefecture recommended him to be the magistrate of Fuli County (符離, in modern Suzhou, Anhui). After his term of service was complete, however, he was not given another official position. He journeyed to Jiannan Circuit (劍南, headquartered in modern Chengdu) and became a soldier in the army there. He successively served under the military governor ("Jiedushi") Xianyu Zhongtong (鮮于仲通) and the general Li Mi (李宓) and participated in Li Mi's campaign against Nanzhao in 754. After Li Mi's defeat that year, Cui returned to the circuit headquarters at Chengdu. The military commander Cui Lun (崔論) was impressed by Cui Gan's appearance and was endeared to him because they shared the same surname, and therefore recommended him to be a commander of the guards for the military governor. Subsequently, Cui Gan served under Cui Yuan and Pei Mian. After Pei was falsely accused and exiled in 762, Emperor Daizong (Emperor Xuanzong's grandson) sent eunuchs to try to investigate Pei for possible misconduct while serving as governor. Cui Gan induced his subordinates to cut off their ears to proclaim Pei's innocence. When the eunuchs returned to capital Chang'an to report this to Emperor Daizong, Cui was recalled to Chang'an to serve as an officer in the imperial forces. Around this time, there was much disturbance in the Shu region (i.e., modern Sichuan and Chongqing), and bandits often blocked off road access. Emperor Daizong was concerned about this, and the official Yan Wu (嚴武) recommended Cui Gan to be the prefect of Li Prefecture (利州, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan) to combat the banditry. Once Cui arrived at Li Prefecture, the banditry ceased, and this led to fame for him.
Service under Yan Wu.
Subsequently, in 764, Yan Wu was made the military governor of Jiannan Circuit, and as he was heading to his post, he went through Li Prefecture. He wanted Cui Gan to serve under him, but as at that time Cui's superior was Zhang Xiancheng (張獻誠) the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), Yan did not feel comfortable requesting Zhang to allow him to have Cui as a subordinate. Cui pointed out that Zhang never fully trusted him and that Zhang favored treasure—suggesting that if Yan made the request and also gave Zhang a substantial gift, Zhang would agree. Once Yan arrived at Chengdu, he sent Zhang a gift of rare treasures, and then requested Zhang to allow him to have Cui. Zhang agreed, and Yan commissioned Cui as the prefect of Han Prefecture (漢州, in modern Deyang, Sichuan). At that time, a large part of former Jiannan territory had been captured by Tufan and its allied Qiang tribes. Yan had Cui command an army to attack Tufan, and it was said that because Cui was capable in comforting his soldiers, the soldiers fought hard for him. He was able to recapture four cities from Tufan, and when he returned to Chengdu, Yan showed his favor to Cui by making a wagon with seven kind of jewels to welcome him back into the city.
Seizure and control of Xichuan Circuit.
Yan Wu died in 765. His deputy Du Ji (杜濟) served as acting military governor after his death, but there were competing recommendations for his permanent replacement. One of the key officers, Guo Yinggan (郭英幹), and the discipline officer Guo Jialin (郭嘉琳), recommended Guo Yinggan's brother Guo Ying'ai (郭英乂), who was then an imperial official at Chang'an. Cui recommended another officer, Wang Chongjun (王崇俊). Emperor Daizong named Guo Ying'ai as the military governor, and it was said that because of Cui's contrary recommendation, Guo Ying'ai bore a grudge against Cui and Wang. Immediately after he arrived at Chengdu, he made false charges against Wang and executed him. He then summoned Cui, who was then back on the Tufan front, back to Chengdu. Cui, believing it to be a trap, refused. Guo Ying'ai then cut off Cui's army's food supplies and further took an army, ready to attack Cui. His advances were stymied by a sudden snowstorm that killed many of his soldiers and animals, however, and Cui then made a surprise attack, defeating him and forcing him to flee back to Chengdu. At that time, the army at Chengdu was resentful toward Guo Ying'ai because he was arrogant, wasteful, and harsh. Cui seized the moment to publicly accuse Guo Ying'ai of treason—pointing out that Guo Ying'ai had taken an effigy of Emperor Xuanzong out of a Taoist temple dedicated to Emperor Xuanzong and converted the temple to his own mansion. Cui then attacked Chengdu and defeated Guo Ying'ai, forcing him to flee. Once Cui entered into Chengdu, he slaughtered Guo Ying'ai's household, and Guo Ying'ai himself was killed in flight by Han Cheng (韓澄) the prefect of Pu Prefecture (普州, in modern Ziyang, Sichuan), who delivered Guo Ying'ai's head to Cui. Several other Jiannan officers rose against Cui—Bo Maolin (柏茂琳) at Qiong Prefecture (邛州, in modern Chengdu), Yang Zilin (楊子琳) at Lu Prefecture (瀘州, in modern Luzhou, Sichuan), and Li Changkui (李昌夔) at Jian Prefecture (劍州, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan) -- throwing the circuit into a confused state.
Emperor Daizong tried to settle the situation by dividing the circuit—making the eastern half of the circuit into Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) and giving the command to Zhang Xiancheng, making the rest into Xichuan Circuit, while giving Bo and Cui the lesser titles of defender (防禦使, "Fangyushi") under the command of the new military governor Du Hongjian, who had been chancellor. Cui did not submit to this arrangement, and when Zhang attacked him in spring 766, Cui defeated Zhang easily. Meanwhile, Du and Cui were exchanging messengers, and Cui acted as respectfully as possible and offered bribes to Du. When Du arrived at Chengdu, Cui treated him with the utmost formal respect but did not permit him any actual control over the governance. In response, Du repeatedly recommended to Emperor Daizong to let Cui become military governor while placating Bo, Yang, and Li Changkui by making them prefects of their prefectures. Emperor Daizong reluctantly agreed, although he initially made Cui only the mayor of Chengdu Municipality and the military commander, under Du. In 767, Du requested to return to Chang'an. Emperor Daizong agreed, and he made Cui the military governor and let Du resume his service as chancellor. Meanwhile, Cui also assured of his position by giving large bribes to Du's powerful chancellor colleague Yuan Zai.
In 768, Cui went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Daizong, leaving his brother Cui Kuan (崔寬) as acting military governor in his stead. Yang took this opportunity to make a surprise attack from Lu Prefecture and briefly entered Chengdu. When the news arrived at Chang'an, Emperor Daizong immediately sent Cui Gan back to Xichuan to put down Yang's uprising—and also bestowed on Cui a new name of Ning (寧, meaning "comfort"). Meanwhile, Cui Kuan initially could not fight Yang off, but Cui Ning's concubine Lady Ren was herself capable in military matters, and she used her wealth to engage a group of soldiers; Cui Kuan was able to use the soldiers she gathered to fight Yang off, and Yang left Chengdu, eventually leaving the circuit by heading east on Yangtze River. Cui Ning subsequently sent Cui Kuan to Chang'an, and because of the large amount of bribes that Cui Ning gave Yuan Zai, Yuan had Cui Kuan and another brother, Cui Shen (崔審), repeatedly promoted.
In 775, Cui Ning reported that he had a great victory over Tufan forces, killing over 10,000 Tufan soldiers. In 776, he again reported a victory over Tufan and its allied Tujue, Tuyuhun, Di, and Qiang tribes, killing over 10,000 soldiers. He repelled a Tufan attack in 777 as well. Meanwhile, it was said that because Xichuan Circuit had natural defenses and was rich, Cui grew arrogant of his position and gathered great wealth. It was also said that he committed adultery with many wives and concubines of his subordinates. The imperial government feared him but could not control him, and had to repeatedly bestow additional honors on him to keep him in check.
Retention by the imperial government.
In 779, Emperor Daizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. After Emperor Dezong's ascension, Cui Ning went to Chang'an to pay homage to the new emperor, and was given several high honorific titles -- "Sikong" (司空, one of the Three Excellencies), chancellor (同中書門下平章事, "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi"), director for construction of Emperor Daizong's tomb (山陵使, "Shanlingshi"), and chief imperial censor (御史大夫, "Yushi Daifu"). Treating his chief imperial censor title as not just honorary, however, Cui proposed that the subordinate imperial censors be recommended by the chief imperial censor (i.e., himself) rather than by chancellors—and this drew resentment from Yang Yan, who by that point had become the most powerful chancellor at court, despite the fact that they had a previous cordial relationship as fellow associates of Yuan Zai's. The relationship between Cui and Yang was further strained as Yang was repeatedly making accusations against another imperial official, Liu Yan, and Cui was defending Liu.
While Cui was at Chang'an, Tufan and Nanzhao forces launched a major joint attack against Xichuan Circuit, and Cui's subordinates were unable to fight them off. When the news arrived at Chang'an, Emperor Daizong was inclined to order Cui to return to Xichuan Circuit at once. Cui was set to depart, but Yang opposed—pointing out that during Cui's tenure, he had effectively turned Xichuan into an independent realm, not submitting taxes or other resources to the imperial government. Yang argued that even if Cui were able to successfully defeat Tufan and Nanzhao forces, it would be even more difficult to move him later on; instead, he suggested that imperial guard soldiers and elite soldiers from Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) -- who had followed their military governor Zhu Ci to Chang'an when Zhu was made chancellor—be sent to fight the Tufan and Nanzhao forces, and once the campaign was over, Xichuan would be back in imperial control. Emperor Dezong agreed with Yang's proposal and kept Cui at Chang'an. Subsequently, Yang claimed that the northern border needed a senior general—someone like Cui—to defend it, and had Cui made the military governor of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, then headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). Shuofang was normally a very important and powerful command. However, Yang weakened Cui's authority substantially by naming three deputies for Cui with independent authorities to act—Du Xiquan (杜希全), stationed at Ling Prefecture (靈州, in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia); Zhang Guangsheng (張光晟), stationed at Sui Prefecture (綏州, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi); and Li Jianhui (李建徽), stationed at Fang Prefecture (坊州, i.e., at Cui's headquarters). Yang secretly ordered the three of them to watch over Cui carefully. Nevertheless, Cui and his subordinate Lü Xiqian (呂希倩) -- whom Yang had commissioned as well—were successful in persuading many Dangxiang tribesmen to submit to Tang, and this drew further displeasure from Yang. He had Lü recalled to Chang'an under guise of a promotion and replaced Lü with Shi Changchun (時常春). Eventually, in 781, he also had Cui recalled to the capital, and Cui retained only his honorary title of "Sikong" but also had him serve as "You Pushe" (右僕射), one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (尚書省, "Shangshu Sheng"), but not chancellor.
Death.
By 783, Emperor Dezong was waging a number of campaigns against several military governors to the east who were not following imperial orders—Zhu Ci's brother Zhu Tao, Wang Wujun, Tian Yue, and Li Na. He summoned soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) to Chang'an, ready to send them to join the campaigns in the east. When the Jingyuan soldiers arrived at Chang'an, however, they were displeased at the lack of imperial awards, and they mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The Jingyuan soldiers then supported Zhu Ci as their leader, and while Zhu was initially pretending to be preparing to put down the mutiny and welcome Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an, it soon became clear that he was planning to take over as emperor. Meanwhile, when Emperor Dezong fled out of the city, few imperial officials knew the direction of his flight and therefore few followed him. Several days later, Cui Ning arrived at Fengtian, and initially, Emperor Dezong was pleased. However, Emperor Dezong's trusted chancellor Lu Qi soon received word that Cui had commented:
Lu feared that Cui would accuse him of causing the calamity, and therefore secretly plotted with an official who had arrived at Fengitan with Cui, Wang Hong (王翃). He had Wang make a secret report to Emperor Dezong that on the way to Fengtian, Cui had frequently stopped to defecate or urinate and appeared to be waiting for Zhu Ci's soldiers. Meanwhile, Zhu, who had declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin, in order to try to create suspicion in Emperor Dezong's minds, also publicly announced that he was making Cui and Liu Hun chancellors. Lu and Wang also forced Cui's secretary Kang Dan (康湛) into forging a letter from Cui to Zhu, offering to betray Fengtian to him. Lu, presenting the forgery to Emperor Dezong, thus falsely accused Cui of treason. Emperor Dezong believed Lu's accusations. He summoned Cui to his presence under the guise of giving him the mission of comforting the Yangtze-Huai River region, and once Cui arrived, had imperial soldiers strangle Cui to death. When Emperor Dezong commissioned the imperial scholar Lu Zhi to issue an edict declaring Cui's guilt, Lu Zhi requested that Lu Qi give him the letter from Cui to Zhu—and Lu Qi then claimed that the letter had been lost. Further, many people were then proclaiming Cui's innocence. As a result, Emperor Dezong, who was initially set to make Cui's family members slaves and confiscate his assets, did neither. In 796, Cui's former subordinate Han Tan (韓潭), then a military governor himself, offered to give up an honorary title he had in exchange to be posthumously declared innocent. Emperor Dezong agreed, and also returned Cui's body to his family for proper reburial.

Lefebvre Busard

__NOTOC__
The Lefebvre MP.205 "Busard" (French: "Harrier") was a single-seat racing aircraft built in France in 1975 and marketed for homebuilding. Its design was adapted from that of the Lefebvre MP-204 'Busard' racer (itself derived from the Max Plan PF.204 Busard), that had been conceived to attempt a world airspeed record in the under 500 kg class in 1949. Compared to its predecessor, the Busard was lightened and intended to be powered by a lower-power engine, and simplified for construction by amateurs. Indeed,the prototype was built by the designer with assistance from students at the Albert Camus technical school of Rouen. Like the MP.204 that it was based on, the Busard was a streamlined, low-wing, cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed, tricycle undercarriage. Provision was made for the use of either an aero engine, or a Volkswagen automotive engine.

Nature Care College

Nature Care College is a private college in St Leonards, New South Wales specialising in natural therapies. Established in 1973 at O'Brian Street Bondi by founders, Catherine McEwan and Allan Hudson as a college to teach Remedial Massage. Its first class consisted of 8 students and was held in one room where theory and practical classes took place. The name Nature Care was considered due to the name Medicare used for our orthodox medical system. Nature Care seemed like the right name so Nature Care College was born.
Remedial Massage was the College's foundation course. Naturopathy, homoeopathy, herbal medicine and other body work therapies were added as the college became more established. While these disciplines are still the mainstay of natural therapies, the syllabus has diversified over the years and the College now offers over 80 lifestyle and accredited courses from astrology, energetic healing and rebirthing to yoga teacher training.
Educational and student facilities have also expanded to include four campus buildings, a training clinic, library, cafe and a yoga and movement studio.

This junction in Malayalam is called "Padinjare Mukh".
Politics.
Kaippattoor is part of Konni Assembly constituency and Pathanamthitta Lok Sabha constituency.
Name and Myth.
The place as Kaipattoor which means "place of relatives"കൈപെട്ടവരിൻ ദേശം or കൈപെട്ടവരിൻ ഊര് .
According to Sangha thamil sahithyam, Kannaki Silapathikaram, the national epic, 
is hailed as the masterpiece of Indian literature - a showcase of the virtues of a Tamil 
society during the Sangam period. The woeful tale of Kannaki, the eternally suffering 
chaste wife who bore her husband’s unchasteful behavior, has emerged as the golden example 
of the powers that accrue to chaste Tamil women. Urged on by a patriarchal, hegemonic 
principle, the concept of chastity (Karpu) for Tamil women evolved as a form of learned
self-denial of sexuality, tolerance, submissiveness and bashfulness that combined to form 
a benevolent power (sakthi). 
Kovalan, the son of a wealthy Vaishya merchant in Kaveripattinam, married Kannagi 
daughter of Manayikkan and she is also from the same community Vaishya, a young woman of 
legendary beauty. They lived together happily in the city of Kaveripattinam, until Kovalan 
met the dancer Madhavi and fell in love with her. In his infatuation he forgot Kannagi and 
gradually spent all his wealth on the dancer. At last, penniless, Kovalan realised his mistake,
and returned to Kannagi. Their only asset was a precious pair of anklets (chilambu-ചിലമ്പ് - കാൽതള
hence the name of the epic), filled with gems, which she gave to him willingly.
With these as their capital they went to the great city of Madurai, where Kovalan hoped to 
recoup his fortunes by trade.
The city of Madurai was ruled by the Pandya king Nedum Cheliyan I. Kovalan's objective 
was to sell the anklets in this kingdom so that he and his wife would be able to start their 
lives over. Unfortunately, around the time he set out to sell the anklets, one anklet 
(out of a pair) was stolen from the queen, by a greedy court member. This anklet looked very 
similar to Kannagi's. The only difference was that Kannagi's were filled with rubies and 
the queen's filled with pearls, but this was not a visible fact. When Kovalan went to the 
market, he was accused of having stolen the anklet. He was immediately beheaded by the
king's guards, without trial. When Kannagi was informed of this, she became furious, 
and set out to prove her husband's innocence to the king.
Kannagi came to the king's court, broke open the anklet seized from Kovalan and showed 
that it contained rubies, as opposed to the queen's anklets which contained pearls. Realizing 
their fault, the King and the Queen died of shame. Unsatisfied, Kannagi tore out a breast and 
flung it on the city, uttering a curse that the entire city be burnt. Due to her utmost chastity, 
her curse became a reality.
The city was set ablaze resulting in huge human and economic losses. However, after the 
request from the goddess of the city, she withdrew her curse and later, attained salvation. 
The story was narrated by the poet Ilango Adigal. A fascinating, but ironic, fact about this 
epic is that it portrays Madhavi, Kovalan's amorous lover, as an equally chaste woman. 
Manimekalai, another ancient Tamil epic, is written in praise of her.
After setting fire to Madurai City,She walks for 14 days to enter the Chera country 
and reaches the spot near Kumuli in Kerala to reunite with her husband. Mariamman worship 
became popular in the State after Kannagi. From Kumuli she walks towards south direction 
through the border of Kerala.On the way she came through the shore of Achankovil river,and
take a rest here in a small village, on that time, some vaishya merchant peoples lived here,
she thoughts,they are my community people, so they are "KAIPETTAVAR"-"കൈപെട്ടവർ" 
(relatives- Kannagi also a vaishya )after she continue her journey towards south at Attukal 
in Thiruvananthapuram. Such a way kaipettavarin ooru "കൈപെട്ടവരിൻ ഊര്" KAIPATTOOR-കൈപട്ടൂർ.
It is also believed that Devi finally reached Kodungalloor and 
settled at Kodungalloor Devi Temple south of Guruvayoor.
The events related to Kannaki have high influence in the traditions and culture of Tamil Nadu 
and Kerala.According to Hindu believes Devi Kannagi is an incarnation of Devi Parvathi or Bhadra,
and Devi Lekshmi and Devi Saraswathi, here in Kaipattoor, mupudathi amman kovil deity have three 
faces(Bhadra,Lekshmi,and Saraswathi) such deity is very rare in Kerala. The Vaishyas are believed 
Devi Kannagi is there "KULA DEVATHA"-കുല ദേവത -community goddess.The Vaishya peoples are living
here Kaipattoor and near by places also, and they are Thamil cultured peoples.

Hypericum androsaemum

Hypericum androsaemum, commonly known as tutsan, is a plant in the genus "Hypericum" native to open woods and hillsides in Eurasia. It is a perennial shrub reaching up to 1.5 m in height.
Common name.
The common name tutsan appears to be a corruption of "toute saine" literally meaning all-healthy. This is probably in reference to its healing properties. The leaves were applied to wounds, and as a stomachic. Nicholas Culpeper, in his 1653 publication "Culpeper's Complete Herbal", says "Tutsan purgeth choleric humours ... both to cure sciatica and gout, and to heal burnings by fire." The berries which turn from white/green, to red, to black are poisonous.
Chemical composition.
Xanthonoids biosynthesis in cell cultures of "Hypericum androsaemum" involves the presence of a benzophenone synthase condensing a molecule of benzoyl-CoA with three malonyl-CoA yielding to 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone. This intermediate is subsequently converted by a benzophenone 3′-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, leading to the formation of 2,3′,4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone.
Invasive plant.
In New Zealand tutsan was recognised as a pasture weed as early as 1955. Biological control methods were investigated about 60 years ago. In 2008 Landcare Research will begin investigating the feasibility of a biological control.
It is also a declared species in Western Australia and Victoria, where it occurs in the wettest regions such as the Otway Ranges and the karri forests. It does not usually invade improved pastures, but is common in run-down pastures and in native forests. When established, tutsan can be dangerous because it is very difficult to remove and is very unpalatable to both native and introduced herbivores.

1984 Chatham Cup

The 1984 Chatham Cup was the 57th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the fourth round (last 32) of the competition. In all, 128 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.
The 1984 final.
The final was shifted by one month from its normal date in early September, being played in October for the first time. Gisborne were expected to win the trophy, being on paper the stronger side, with internationals Grant Turner, Kenny Cresswell and Colin Walker all in their line-up. 
In the final, however, it was Manurewa who proved the sturdier side. Largely through the efforts of keeper Rudi Feitsma the soaked up the Gisborne pressure, while swift breaks saw Manurewa score twice with a brace from Steve Sumner in the 11th and 28th minutes. A strike from Cresswell in the 80th minute gave the East Coast side some hope of a comeback, but it was too late to save the day.

Hōkyōintō

Structure and function.
Usually made in stone and occasionally metal or wood, "hōkyōintō" started to be made in their present form during the Kamakura period. Like a "gorintō", they are divided in five main sections called (from the bottom up) , or "inverted flower seat", , or base, , or body, , or umbrella, and , or pagoda finial. The "tōshin" is the most important part of the "hōkyōintō" and is carved with a Sanskrit letter. The 'sōrin" has the same shape as the tip of a five-storied pagoda. The "kasa" can also be called , or roof. It's decorated with four characteristic wings called or . Different structures exist, and the "hōkyōintō" property of the Yatsushiro Municipal Museum in Kyushu for example is divided in just four parts, with no "kaeribanaza".
The sūtra contain all the pious deeds of a Tathagata Buddha, and the faithful believe that praying in front of a "hōkyōintō" their sins will be canceled, during their lives they will be protected from disasters and after death they will go to heaven.
The "hōkyōintō" tradition in Japan is old and is believed to have begun during the Asuka period (550–710 CE). They used to be made of wood and started to be made in stone only during the Kamakura period. It is also during this period that they started to be used also as tombstones and cenotaphs.

The Waxwings

The Waxwings are a rock band from Detroit, Michigan, United States, formed in 1997. 
The band's lineup consists of Dean Fertita on vocals and guitar, James Edmunds on drums and percussion, and Kevin Peyok on bass guitar. Brendan Benson has filled in on guitar for touring, following the departure of guitarist/vocalist Dominic Romano.
They have released three full-length albums: "Low to the Ground" in 2000, "Shadows Of..." in 2002, and "Let's Make Our Descent" in 2004. The band's music draws its influences from 1960s psychedelic pop and folk rock, featuring rich, complex instrumentation and vocal harmonies which separate them from the raw garage rock revival scene in Detroit.
The Waxwings have toured with Guided By Voices, Travis, Matthew Sweet, The Strokes, and fellow Detroit band The White Stripes.
History.
Formation.
The band was formed by Dean Fertita, after a friend booked a show for him at Arlene's Grocery in New York five days later. At the time, Fertita was working at the independent Detroit record store Off the Record with bassist Kevin Peyok, and invited him to play the show. Peyok contacted drummer James Edmunds and guitarist Dominic Romano, and the lineup was complete. The band's name, as well as the name of their debut record, was derived from the first line of a poem in Vladimir Nabokov's novel "Pale Fire":
Previously, Fertita, Romano and Peyok had played together in the shoegaze band Glider along with The Sights' Mike Trombley.
"Low to the Ground".
While working at Off the Record, Fertita met Bob Salerno, the head of Chicago's Bobsled Records, while he was in Detroit searching for bands to sign. Fertita recommended music from Detroit bands The Go and The White Stripes, but did not mention that he was also a musician. A few months later, Salerno contacted Fertita, expressing interest in the Waxwings. The Waxwings signed with Bobsled Records and began work on their debut album, "Low to the Ground", recorded at Terrarium Studios in Minneapolis, Minnesota with Bryan Hanna.
The album was released on May 2, 2000, to positive reviews from critics:
Low to the Ground was featured in Magnet Magazine's Top 20 albums of 2000-2001. As well, the White Stripes have performed a live cover of "Fragile Girl" with Beck.
The Waxwings toured in support of "Low to the Ground" for 15 months, then returned to the studio to record their second album.
"Shadows Of...".
Once again recorded at Minnesota's Terrarium Studios, The Waxwings' second album, "Shadows Of...", was released on Bobsled Records on July 11, 2002.
Following the release of "Shadows of..." in 2002, Bob Salerno sent the band an expletive-filled letter ridiculing them for what he considered a poor performance at their CD release party. The letter gained notoriety after being posted on the internet entertainment forum "the Velvet Rope".
During this period, guitarist Dominic Romano got married and left the band.
The band separated from Bobsled, although the label still retained the rights to their third record. After hearing "Shadows Of..." through mutual friend Matt Smith (of Outrageous Cherry), Rainbow Quartz Records offered to free the Waxwings from their contract with Bobsled.
"Let's Make Our Descent".
Their third album, "Let's Make Our Descent" was recorded with Brendan Benson at Grand Studio in Detroit, and released on August 13, 2004. Benson and Fertita had attended Kimball High School in Royal Oak, Michigan together, and Fertita played guitar in Benson's band when scheduling allowed, as well as touring with him. For the Waxwings' 2005 tour, Benson assumed duties as the band's temporary guitarist.
Current projects.
The news page of the Waxwings official site states that the band has begun working on songs for the fourth album. This was last updated in 2005.
In Spring 2007, Dean Fertita joined Queens of the Stone Age as the keyboardist for their sixth record, "Era Vulgaris", taking over for Natasha Shneider. He toured with the band through Fall 2008, and in August 2008 was expected to go into the studio with the band to record their next album. As well, Fertita is the guitarist and one of the main songwriters of supergroup The Dead Weather, which includes the Kills' Alison Mosshart and fellow Detroit musicians Jack White and Jack Lawrence.
Kevin Peyok is now in London-based band The See See.
The See See have toured with the Raconteurs and plan to release their debut LP in 2009.

New South Wales Z19 class locomotive

The Z19 class (formally A.93 class) was a class of steam locomotive built for and operated by the New South Wales Government Railways of Australia.
History.
By 1877 the main lines in New South Wales were nearing Tamworth, Wagga Wagga and Orange. The additional distances required an increase in motive power, especially as at that time, locomotives were changed after quite short journeys. They were only in service when manned by their regular crew.
Between 1877 and 1881, the initial order of 50 of these 0-6-0 wheel arrangement locomotives were delivered from Beyer, Peacock and Company. Between 1880 and 1891, Beyer, Peacock delivered a further nine and local manufacturer, Henry Vale and Company eighteen.
The load which these locomotives could haul over the Blue Mountains line was 128 tonnes at 11–13 km/h. William Thow, the then Locomotive Engineer of the South Australian Railways, was commissioned by the New South Wales Government in 1888 to enquire into the New South Wales Government Railways locomotives and rolling stock. He recommended modifications to this class as he considered them to be the best designed and proportioned of the locomotives then in service. This included Belpaire boilers and new cabs.
Following the reclassification of locomotives in 1891, three additional similar locomotives were added to the class. With the arrival of the T class saw the class relegated to secondary roles and coal services in Newcastle. Between April 1902 and February 1910, fourteen were converted to 20 class 2-6-4 tank engines at Eveleigh Railway Workshops. By 1933 many had been withdrawn, with only 36 remaining in service.
Having a short wheelbase and no leading bogie, the locomotives had a tendency to derail and they were ultimately restricted to a maximum speed of 40 km/h and relegated to shunting and branch line traffic. Driven slowly, they could negotiate the most appalling curves and badly maintained or unballasted tracks. They were therefore ideal in goods yards, such as Darling Harbour and Port Waratah with the last two withdrawn from the latter in August 1972. Branch lines such as those to Dorrigo, Batlow and Oberon where grades of up to 1 in 25 and curves as sharp as 100m radius could be encountered were ideal for this class and these were the only locomotives permitted on these lines until dieselisation.
Preservation.
Four locomotives of the class have been preserved:

<doc id="19368896" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19368896" title="SOBI2">
SOBI2

Sigsiu Online Business Index 2 (also known as Sobi2) is an open source web directory component and content construction kit (CCK) for the Joomla! content management system (CMS). Sobi2 is written in PHP and requires the MySQL database environment for storage. It is best suited for low to medium-level traffic web-sites.
Sobi2 is an add-on to Joomla that makes it possible to run and manage a directory in a Joomla website. The core Joomla system offers a link component; it is limited. Sobi2 on the other hand has features that make it stand out from other directory components. It can be used as a web directory or as a directory to physical locations, like golf courses. It has built-in integration with Google Maps (API key from Google is required) and it has additional plug-ins available just for Sobi2.
Sobi2 works in Joomla! 1.5 native mode without the legacy plug-in enabled. The Joomla! 1.5 FTP-Layer will not be supported.
There is an option to make features of the listing paid for or free. Listings could be free but charge for links to the websites. This is decided when setting up and managing the component.
Sobi2 - The Directory Component for Joomla.
Sobi2 (Sigsiu Online Business Index 2) is an open source directory component for Joomla!, the open source content management system. Using Sobi2 a Joomla user can have a directory of contacts, members, distributors, manufacturers, locations, products, or whatever very quickly with little or no "coding" - most or all of the set-up may be done using only the configuration interface. Add data, to produce a working directory on the Joomla web site. 
History.
In 2006 Joomla! Sigsiu.NET developed a Content Construction Kit for Joomla. Designed as a business directory (online business index), Sobi2 could be used for every kind of directory.
Sobi2 has been designed as the follower of the SOBI (or SOBI1) component but it is not based on SOBI. It has been built up new from the bottom. This was necessary because the table structure of SOBI1 was not suited for the features "sub-categories", "one entry in multi-categories" and "user definable fields". Sobi2 uses a relational database structure. Sobi2 is built up almost object oriented, but still runs under PHP4 and MySQL4.
Features.
Sobi2 is an add-on to Joomla! that makes it possible to run and manage a directory in your Joomla! website.
Content Construction using Sobi2 Fields Manager.
All fields which are necessary for a directory can be created using the Fields Manager. There are several field types to choose from like text input fields, text areas (w/o WYSIWYG editor), check boxes, check box groups, select lists (drop down lists), simple text fields or a calendar field.
For text input fields there are additional settings available. A text input field can be defined to be used for an URL address, an email address, a link to an image or to a video/audio file. According to this setting the entered data will be shown in the views with the necessary syntactical format.
Sobi2 shows the data in two views. In an overview (Category View) all entries of the directory will be shown in such called V-Cards (similar to small business cards). Each entry has a link to its detailed description (Details View). It is definable which fields should be shown in which view with a simple click in the Fields Manager. Therefore it is also possible that a field is not shown in any of the views.
To earn money with the directory, it is definable in the Fields Manager for which information the author of an entry has to pay a fee. Also the amount of the fee is selectable.
During installation, Sobi2 creates by default several custom fields for a business directory. They can be deleted or extended by any number of own fields.]
Classification into categories.
For a better lucidity of the directory, the entries within Sobi2 are divided into categories. For that a Category Manager is available. With the Category Manager it is possible to create, edit and delete categories within the directory.
As many categories as the administrator of the website likes can be created with an unlimited nesting depth. That means, each category can contain sub categories which can contain sub categories as well, and so on.
An entry can be assigned to one or more categories. For a simple directory it is also possible to assign all entries automatically to a pre-defined category. Thus, the category selection by the user isn’t necessary.]
Presentation of images in the directory.
According to the configuration of Sobi2, the author of an entry can upload up to two images for each entry. At this, the images will be reduced to a pre-defined size. These image can be shown either in the V-Cards of the overview (Category View) and/or in the detailed view of the entry.
Additionally the Sobi2 Gallery plugin can be installed. This plugin allows the users to upload an additional unlimited number of images to their entries. These images will be shown in the detailed view as small thumbnails and on click they will be shown enlarged with lightbox effect.]
Adding and editing of entries.
Sobi2 provides an entry form, which will be called from front-end of the user's site. The form contains the self-defined fields. The layout of the form can be changed by the usage of the built-in template engine. Thereby it is possible to divide the input data into tabs which is useful especially for a lot of fields.
Sobi2 can be configured in this way, only registered users of a site can add entries to the directory. It is also configurable that adding entries is allowed for guests too.
For the administrator of the site there is an Entry Manager in the administration panel of Sobi2 available. With the Entry Manager it is possible to create, edit or delete an entry.]
Publishing an entry only for a certain period.
Especially for directories with paid entries, but also to keep the directory up to date, Sobi2 has the possibility to associate the entries with an expiration date. Either a fixed period for which the entries will be published (e.g. 90 days) can be set up, or the expiration date of an entry is defined individually.
Additionally the author of an entry can define the expiration date by himself using a calendar field. This is meaningful especially for directories with advertisements.
If an entry is expired, it can be renewed by the author himself. At a defined period prior to expiration, a message visible only to the author of the entry is shown. By the use of an additional link the author can renew his entry.]
Email generation.
Sobi2 sends out emails on occurrence of events like adding, editing or renewing entries by the author or also if an entry is approved by the administrator. It is adjustable if only the author of the entry and/or also the administrator will get an email. The Joomla! user group which will get the administrator emails is freely selectable. Also selection of several groups is possible.
Sending out an email can be set up separately for each event. The content of the emails can be defined separately for each event in the administration panel of Sobi2. For that different placeholders are available.
A previously defined signature will be added at the end of each email.]
Views for presentation of categories and entries.
As a complex Joomla! component, Sobi2 has different views for front-end.
The main view of Sobi2 typically consists of the presentation of the main categories. Additionally the entries within those main categories or all entries in the directory can be shown in V-Card view.
Additionally to the category views there are other views available which will show V-cards of entries. e.g. it is possible to show the newest/latest, the most popular or recently edited entries or only the entries of a specific user.
An alpha index is available to show entries and categories (or only entries) starting with a certain letter in V-Card view. The alpha index is configurable and the letters can be arranged.
The meta keywords entered for the entries, can be used as tags. All tags of an entry can be shown in the detailed view as links to lists with all entries with the same tagged word. Using tags is recommended for a good indexing in search engines.]
Adaption of Sobi2/templates.
Sobi2 can be used "out of the box" but can be adapted individually to the site. Thes adaptation take place at different levels.
Sobi2 has its own style sheet file (CSS). Nearly almost all elements of Sobi2 are addressable by classes (or IDs) and therefore configurable. Change specifically margins, colours or fonts only by changing the CSS file.
The CSS file can be edited in the Sobi2 administration panel, using an editor with syntax highlighting.
For advanced adaptations there are separate templates available for the V-Card view and for the detailed view. With some HTML skills and using the so-called template commands, own views can be created. It is possible to create an own template for the add entry form.
All templates are editable in the Sobi2 administration panel, using an editor with syntax highlighting.]
The description of possibilities of this template engine can be found on the official homepage in the article "Template Commands"
Since version RC 2.9, the Sobi2 template system was extended. It is possible now to select individual templates for each category. Therefore also a template installer has been implemented.
Extensive diagnosis systems integrated.
Sobi2 has a debug mode to log occurring problems in a file. The debug level is adjustable. The template parser is helpful in finding syntactical errors while developing an own template. To detect if a server meets the requirements for Sobi2, a built-in system check is available.
Multiple instances of Sobi2.
The Sobi2 Development Team provides a bash script called "Sobi2 Cloning Tool". It is a script to clone Sobi2 and all possible add-ons. It allows installation of multiple instances of Sobi2. The official Sobi2 demo site uses a clone called com_extensions (similar to Joomla Extensions Directory). This Sobi2 clone (and all add-ons for it) has been created with this script.
Plug-in interface.
Sobi2 plugins enhance the functionality of Sobi2. There are plugins available to add an image or media gallery or to use Sobi2as a download directory.]
Some of the plugins to Sobi2 include a Review & Rating Plugin and Gallery Plugin. They make it possible for creation and running of a complete rating and review directory where people can submit listings, submit reviews and upload photos. Even if the Community builder component is not run, Sobi2 can allow people to build entire web pages about their listing.]
Languages.
Language packages are available for Sobi2.

Arceuthobium douglasii

Arceuthobium douglasii is a species of dwarf mistletoe known as Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Texas to California, where it lives in forest and woodland as a parasite. It is found mostly on Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees but occasionally on fir (Abies spp.) as well.
This is a greenish shrub which is visible as a network of scaly stems extending above the bark of its host tree. Most of the mistletoe is located inside the host tree, attached to it via haustoria, which tap the tree for water and nutrients. The leaves of the mistletoe are reduced to scales on its surface. It is dioecious, with male and female mistletoe plants producing spikes of staminate and pistillate flowers, respectively. The fruit is a sticky berry a few millimeters long which explodes to disperse the seeds it contains several meters away from the parent plant and its host tree.

Leduc 0.21

__NOTOC__
The Leduc 0.21 was a research aircraft built in France in 1953 to refine the practicalities of ramjet propulsion. Initially proposed as the 0.20, it was essentially similar to its predecessor, the Leduc 0.10, but scaled up by around 30%, with tip tanks added to the wings. Again, it was not capable of take-off under its own power, and had to be carried aloft and released. 
Two examples were built and completed a very detailed flight test program from 1953 to 1956 to develop automated, operationally viable throttle controls for the ramjet. This included a total of 284 free flights. Designed for subsonic speeds only, the 0.21 reached a top speed of Mach 0.95.

Bold Venture (horse)

Bold Venture (1933–1958), was an American Thoroughbred racehorse that won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.
Background.
Bold Venture was sired by the multiple British stakes winner, St Germans, who, after his importation to stand at Greentree Stud in Lexington, Kentucky, became the leading sire of 1931 when his son Twenty Grand won the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. St. Germans own sire, Swynford, also a stakes winner, was a top British stallion whose other sons included English Derby winner Sansovino, English Derby second St. Germans, Challenger (also imported to the United States, where he sired American Horse of the Year Challedon), Lancegaye (imported to the U.S. and sire of Kentucky Derby winner Cavalcade), and Blandford, a leading sire in Europe and the sire of four English Derby winners. Bold Venture's dam, Possible, was by Ultimus, a son of Commando.
Racing career.
Bold Venture, trained by Hall of Fame conditioner Max Hirsch, was entered in the 1936 Kentucky Derby without achieving a single stakes win. His rider was apprentice jockey Ira "Babe" Hanford, who had been riding in races for less than a year. Hanford's contract was owned by Hirsch's daughter, Mary, also a trainer. Just as Hanford's mount had never won a stakes race, no apprentice had ever won the Derby. Bold Venture was held at 20-1 odds in the Derby.
That year, Brevity, owned by Joseph E. Widener of Elmendorf Farm, was the favorite. Brevity had won the Florida Derby and had equaled the world record for 1 1/8 miles. Indian Broom, owned by Austin C. Taylor, was second favorite after lowering Brevity's record in the Marchbank Handicap.
As soon as the gates opened, Brevity was knocked to his knees, and the horse who would go on to win that year's American Horse of the Year award, Granville, threw his rider, James Stout. Indian Broom was trapped in a scrum of racing horses. Bold Venture was in no better position. On the way out of the gate, another horse slammed into him, which was like, Hanford said: "...a bowling ball hitting the pins." This started a chain reaction that caused Granville to throw Stout. But Bold Venture then found running room and by the backstretch had taken the lead. Then Brevity broke free of the pack and came charging after Bold Venture. However, Bold Venture crossed the finish line first.
The win did little for Bold Venture's reputation. Aside from the mess at the start, Charles Kurtsinger, the rider of the Santa Anita Derby winner He Did, claimed someone leaned over the rail and snatched his whip, causing his horse to come in seventh. The general consensus was that Bold Venture's win was largely due to bad luck for better horses.
Two weeks later, Bold Venture was entered in the $50,000 Preakness Stakes. This time ridden by George Woolf, he had a second bad start but still won, beating Granville by a nose.
Undefeated in his three-year-old season, and with two legs of the Triple Crown won, Bold Venture bowed a tendon and was retired.
Stud record.
Owner Morton L. Schwartz sold Bold Venture to Robert J. Kleberg Jr. for a reported $40,000 as a breeding animal. Although Bold Venture did not have immediate success as a stallion in Kentucky, he then stood at Kleberg's King Ranch in Texas, and there sired a pair of top-class racehorses: Assault, the 1946 U.S. Triple Crown champion, and Middleground, winner of the 1950 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes.
Bold Venture died in 1958 at age twenty-five.

Baghar Cheena airstrike

The Baghar Cheena UAV strike (Baghar Cheena literally means "Without Sugar" in Urdu) happened in the evening on Tuesday 17 September 2008, when four missiles fired from an United States Air Force drone aircraft hit the village of Baghar Cheena in the mountains of South Waziristan, in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan, about 4 kilometres from the Afghan border and 55 kilometres west of Wana, the main town in the region and close to Angoor Ada, the village that was raided by US commandos on 3 September. The missiles hit a militant training camp, killing five and injuring at least six people. 
This was the sixth confirmed U.S. missile attack inside Pakistan since the end of August 2008, and comes two days after a Pakistan-U.S standoff on 15 September 2008, in which Pakistani forces fired shots into the air, in order to deter U.S. forces from entering Pakistani territory. The incident came as the top US military commander, Admiral Michael Mullen met Pakistan’s most senior army officer, General Ashfaq Kayani and prime-minister Yousuf Raza Gilani in Islamabad to discuss growing tension over US attacks along the border.

Leduc 0.22

__NOTOC__
The Leduc 0.22 was the prototype of a Mach 2 fighter built in France in 1956. 
Design.
It was the first attempt at a practical application of the ramjet technology that had been developed in the 0.10 and 0.21 research aircraft over the previous years. Unlike all previous Leduc aircraft, it featured swept wings and a coaxial turbojet-ramjet powerplant to enable unassisted operation. 
Test flights.
First flown on 26 December 1956 on turbojet power alone, the ramjet was finally fired on the 34th flight, on 18 May 1957. Another 80 flights took place before the cancellation of the project in favour of the more conventional Dassault Mirage III. A second prototype was under construction at the time. 
End of operations.
Although intended to be a supersonic fighter, the 0.22 proved unable to exceed the speed of sound (Mach 1) because of the prohibitive drag induced by its non-area-ruled fuselage at near-sonic speeds. The cancellation of the project marked the end of René Leduc's aircraft development activities.

John Meredith (folklorist)

John Stanley Raymond Meredith (17 January 1920 – 18 February 2001) was an Australian pioneer folklorist from Holbrook, New South Wales whose work influenced the Australian folk music revival of the 1950s. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1986 for service to Australian folklore and music, and became a Member of the Order of Australia in 1992 for service to the Arts, particularly in the collection and preservation of Australian folklore.
Career.
Early life.
A pioneer collector of Australian folk music and song, John Meredith was born in Holbrook, New South Wales, to Bert and Ellen Meredith. Bert played the button (bush) accordion, often playing dance tunes for his family after dinner. Bert Meredith worked as a drover along the Darling and Murrumbidgee rivers in NSW and was often away. His father played the button accordion, an old and much patched Mezon Grand Organ model he probably learned to play whilst away droving and when he was at home he played the popular songs and dances of the Bush. He also played the mouth organ, using a tin pannikin as a resonator or playing the bones as he played on mouth organ. He died when John was only nine years old, but many of his tunes stayed in John’s mind. 
Ellen looked after John and six more on a small block in Holbrook and he remembers that she sang a little as she worked and she entertained the kids with readings from Australian books and magazines such as The Bulletin. Meredith took up the button accordion and at the age of fourteen, when Ellen promised him a brand new "Melba" model if he learnt how to play on his father's old and patched Mezon. He learned to play from the locals as well as learning some tunes from the gramophone. At seventeen or eighteen he began to assist with the playing at local dances and later would play for the entire evening if no other musician was available.
Meredith was educated at Holbrook Public School until the age of fourteen but was unable to complete the Intermediate Certificate as the family did not have the means to purchase the required school books. He developed an interest in Australian bush songs when he bought a copy of Banjo Paterson's Old Bush Songs. At the same time, he discovered photography. These three discoveries, music, bush songs and photographs were to become Meredith's lifetime passions. 
He continued to develop his skills as a photographer and musician whilst working in Holbrook at a pharmacy. In 1944 Meredith moved to Melbourne and three years later decided to travel the east coast of Australia on his pushbike, picking up work where he could. During this time, Meredith travelled from Melbourne to Cairns and eventually settled in Sydney. In Sydney, Meredith joined the Eureka Youth League, the Communist Party, and the People's Choir. It was at this time that he began to seek out traditional Australian songs to include in the choir's repertoire. 
In 1952 he was introduced to Jack Lee, an old man known as "Hoop-iron". "Hoop-iron" knew many of the old bush songs Meredith had been trying to find and Meredith started to record them. He soon discovered that he had uncovered an entire network of old singers and musicians who knew material that was assumed to have been lost from Australian culture. Meredith's long career as a folklore collector began. In the early 1950s Meredith formed Australia's first bush band The Bushwhackers (unrelated to the contemporary band of similar name). The band received much attention after performing in the very successful Sydney New Theatre production of the musical Reedy River, by Dick Diamond. 
In 1954 Meredith became the secretary of the newly formed Australian Folklore Society and also assisted in the formation of the Bush Music Club in Sydney. During this time he spent every available weekend travelling throughout NSW collecting songs and dance tunes from some of Australia's finest traditional singers. In 1960 Meredith was the recipient of an Australian Literature Fund Grant for 500 pounds to publish a book based on his field work and recordings. He suffered a heart attack at this time and the book, Folk Songs of Australia, co-written by Hugh Anderson, did not appear until 1967. For the next ten years, Meredith continued to write about his work and published many more books about folk life in Australia. In 1981 Meredith re-discovered his love for collecting and photographing Australian bush singers and musicians, which he continued to do until his health failed him. The Meredith Collection is housed at the National Library of Australia and contains nearly 8,000 catalogued items including photos and material collected from over 700 performers.
The Bushwhackers and "Reedy River".
In 1952, Meredith formed the first Australian bush band with Jack Barrie and Brian Loughlan. Originally known as The Heathcote Bushwhackers, they were later simply known as The Bushwhackers. Meredith had begun to collect and record bush music and songs and the band aimed to perform this new repertoire to promote the folk music traditions of rural Australia. The band were unique in that they performed with traditional bush instruments. Meredith played the button (or bush) accordion or squeezebox, and the tin whistle. Barrie played the bush bass or tea chest bass and Loughlan played the lagerphone, also known as the Murrumbidgee River Rattler. Late in 1952 they gave their first performance at the Rivoli Hall in Hurstville. It was at this time that the name of the band was permanently changed to The Bushwhackers.
In December 1953 the band performed in the Sydney New Theatre amateur production of "Reedy River", an Australian musical play written by Dick Diamond featuring bush and Australian folk music, some of which had been collected by Meredith. The success of "Reedy River" primarily inspired the Australian folk music revival of the 1950s. In 1954 Meredith was one of the founding members of the first club set up to cater to this interest, the Bush Music Club of Sydney.
The Bushwhackers disbanded in 1957. Many of its members continued to perform in bush bands such as The Rambleers and The Galahs, and Meredith continued to collect field recordings of Australian traditional and folk music.
Original works.
Meredith also wrote unpublished ballad opera and rock opera. He wrote several plays, including "The Wild Colonial Boy" with Joan Clarke, first produced by Brisbane New Theatre in 1955, and "How Many Miles from Gundagai" performed by the Bushwhackers.
Song collecting.
Some of the songs and music featured in the production of "Reedy River" had been collected by Meredith himself. He collected a wide variety of folk music, including Sally Sloane, a traditional singer with a large repertoire of songs many of which had not been collected previously. Meredith also collected songs by Duke Tritton, a poet and songwriter whose work reflected his experiences as a shearer and as an unemployed itinerant worker during the Great Depression. Both song books and non-fiction works on the folklore of Australia were published by Meredith over the course of his career.
Meredith continued to collect field recordings of traditional songs and music throughout his life. His recordings are housed in the Meredith Collection at the National Library of Australia.

Evidence (Steve Lacy album)

Evidence is the fourth album by Steve Lacy and was released on the New Jazz label in 1962. It features performances of four tunes written by Thelonious Monk and two from Duke Ellington by Lacy, Don Cherry, Carl Brown and Billy Higgins.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Al Campbell awarded the album 4 stars stating "Soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy continued his early exploration of Thelonious Monk's compositions on this 1961 Prestige date, Evidence. Lacy worked extensively with Monk, absorbing the pianist's intricate music and adding his individualist soprano saxophone mark to it. On this date, he employs the equally impressive Don Cherry on trumpet, who was playing with the Ornette Coleman quartet at the time, drummer Billy Higgins, who played with both Coleman and Monk, and bassist Carl Brown. Cherry proved capable of playing outside the jagged lines he formulated with Coleman, being just as complimentary and exciting in Monk's arena with Lacy. Out of the six tracks, four are Monk's compositions while the remaining are lesser known Ellington numbers: "The Mystery Song" and "Something to Live For" (co-written with Billy Strayhorn).".

Plot.
A top notch seven-member team of doctors and nurses known as “Team Batista” are Tojo University Hospital’s pride and joy. The medical team performs a prominent heart surgery known as the Batista Operation which has a normal 60% success rate, but the team has consecutively pulled off twenty six successful surgeries. However, the streak is broken after a string of three procedures end in their patients' deaths. Consequently, an internal investigation is launched with hospital therapist Kohei Taguchi in charge of uncovering the truth behind the incidents. When Taguchi is unable to find any definitive information, the deaths are labeled as unexplainable accidents. The evaluation is subsequently dismissed by Keisuke Shiratori, an investigator with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, who re-launches the investigation on the basis that the deaths were actually murders.
Film.
The filmis based on an award-winning novel and its popularity resulted in roughly 25 movie studios and television networks fighting over adaptation rights, in the end TBS won out. The novel was adapted for the screen by Hiroshi Saitō and Mitsuharu Makita. The film began shooting October 7, 2008 and was primarily shot in Tokyo. "The Glorious Team Batista" was in theaters on February 9, 2008 and became a commercial success, grossing 264 million yen from 284 screens its opening weekend.
When "The Glorious Team Batista" was screened at the Udine Far East Film Festival, it received mediocre reviews. Todd Brown of "Twitch" wrote:
"The characters are stock at best, the story arc blandly predictable and the ending drawn out beyond reasonable bounds. The technical end is solid and the performances good enough but the script for this just feels far more like a lengthy episode of prime time network television from the pre-HBO era – much more Murder She Wrote or Matlock than Dexter – than it feels like the feature film – adapted from a popular mystery novel – that it is. Horrible? No, just horribly bland."
Similarly, Ross Chen of "Love HK Film" wrote:
"...The Glorious Team Batista is a ragingly obvious commercial film, with manufactured characters, drama, and situations that seem ripped from a pulpy bestseller you might find featured in an airport bookstore (Surprise! The film is based on a novel.). This is a big-screen medical thriller built for mainstream audiences, and it seldom delivers anything beyond the required or expected... Regardless, the whole is too glossy and commercial to be anymore more than an average medical thriller suited to undemanding audiences."
A sequel to the film titled "The Triumphant Return of General Rouge" was released March 7, 2009. The sequel will be adapted from "General Rouge no Gaisen," which is the third book in the same novel series as "Team Batista." Yuko Takeuchi and Hiroshi Abe will reprise their roles, with director Yoshihiro Nakamura also returning. Masato Sakai has been cast as the films antagonist.

Christian Pontus Andersson (born 1977) is a Swedish artist and sculptor, living in Södermalm, Stockholm.
Christian Pontus Andersson was born in the small town Brattfors, county of Värmland, in Sweden. First working as a television journalist, Andersson hesitated between studying plastic surgery or becoming an artist. He started studying ceramics at Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, in Stockholm in 2002. During his studies, he opened a ceramic workshop in the Chinese “porcelain capital” Jingdezhen where he produced his master’s degree project, the large scale baroque series "Cry Me the Sorrows" (2007). Combining both high artistic and craftsmanship level, his work gained a lot of attention at the annual Spring exhibition, and led to his first acclaimed solo exhibition at Christian Larsen Gallery (Aerea). Andersson has also exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Stockholm, and participated in group exhibitions in Tokyo, Munich, Frankfurt, and Milan.
The work of Christian Pontus Andersson balances between kitch and stringent form, creating a contrast between the extravagant homoerotic appearances of the figures and the fragile material of which they are made. As sources of inspiration, Andersson mentions Czech artist Alphonse Mucha, and his work also resembles of Michelangelo, Matthew Barney and Jeff Koons.

Kōzuke-Musashi Campaign

The Kōzuke-Musashi campaign was a rapid and direct assault during the Japanese Genkō War by Nitta Yoshisada that led up to the Siege of Kamakura in 1333. It consisted of a number of battles over a brief period. The ultimate result was the ending of the Kamakura Shogunate.
Background.
By the first part of the 14th century, the Kamakura Shogunate, which had never fully recovered from successfully fending off the Mongol Invasions, was already engaging a resurgent imperial house under Go-Daigo during the Genkō War. Go-Daigo's son Prince Morinaga energetically organized an uprising against the Hōjō recruiting a number of the key martial leaders that supported the Emperor including Kusunoki Masashige. Early in 1333 Morninaga and Kusunoki, the latter being entrenched at Chihaya, were the targets of a large army sent from Kamakura to destroy the uprising. This left Kamakura relatively undefended.
Nitta Yoshisada, who was originally supporting the Hojo Regents of Kamakura, was convinced to support the imperial cause. From his home base in Kōzuke Province, Nitta and a group of other nobles including his brother Yoshisuke took advantage of the lightly defended Kamakura and entered Musashi Province in force. Following the important Kamakura Kaidō highway, Nitta's army received fresh recruits along the way from local powerful clans and repeatedly engaged the Hojo forces until reaching the outskirts of Kamakura, thus beginning the Siege of Kamakura.
The Campaign.
Nitta's forces entered Musashi from Kōzuke and joined the Kamakura Kaidō at Sugaya. The principle battles were:

Ecuadorian football league system

The Ecuadorian football league system is a series of interconnected football leagues for clubs in Ecuador, and is governed by the Federación Ecuatoriana de Fútbol at the national level.
Structure.
The Ecuadorian league system consists of two categories, with the top category divided into two series. At the top of the pyramid is "Primera Categoría, Serie A" (shorten to "Primera A"), which consists of the top teams of the country. Below them is "Primera Categoría, Serie B" (shorten to "Primera B"). Teams in the Primera Categoria play independent of the 18 provincial organizations that make up the Segunda Categoria, and independently of each other. The "Segunda Categoria" is the next level below the Primera Categoria. This is by far the largest level in the league system in terms of number of teams. Teams in this category play within their provincial associations to qualify to a larger national tournament.

The Isle of Love

The Isle of Love is a 1922 recut of a 1918 silent drama film Over the Rhine starring female impersonator Julian Eltinge. The film also contained two actors unknown during filming: Virginia Rappe and Rudolph Valentino. The film went through various recuts and rereleases during the 1920s and is generally known for its cast.
Plot.
An Island (The Isle of Love) run by a crazed with power Duke is in turmoil. The peasants plan a revolt, with two buddies including Cliff (Julian Eltinge) planning to overthrow the corrupt Duke. Cliff invites his friend Jacques (Rudolph Valentino) to help, though Jacques spends most of his time with his love Vanette (Virginia Rappe). Meanwhile Cliff dresses up as a female as part of the plan and after much chaos all is well and he returns to America safe and sound.
Release and different versions.
The original film was titled "Over the Rhine" and was an anti German propaganda piece starring Julian Eltinge, a transvestite actor, who was extremely popular at the time. Filmed in 1918 "Over the Rhine" was shelved without release as World War I ended before it could go into distribution.
Two years later the film was recut and titled "An Adventuress". How it was recut is unknown, however the film was not well received. In 1922, after Valentino rose to fame with "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse", and Virginia Rappe had died in what became a scandal, the film was released once again under the title "The Isle of Love".
"The Isle of Love" featured a poorly spliced-together story, which mostly intended to cash in on Valentino's newfound fame despite his original role being quite small, and also on the fallout from Rappe's death. This led to shots of him being repeated several times nonsensically; and including his character for no apparent reason. "The Isle of Love" cut is the only version of the film still in existence, and bears little resemblance to the original "Over the Rhine" storyline. The final cut was a commercial failure much like "An Adventuress".
"The Isle of Love" has yet to be released on DVD or home video, but a complete print of that version survives at the UCLA Film Archive.

Prosansanosmilus

Prosansanosmilus is an extinct genus of mammalian carnivores of the suborder Feliformia, family Barbourofelidae, which lived in Europe during the Miocene epoch (16.9—16.0 mya), existing for approximately .
Taxonomy.
"Prosansanosmilus" was named by Heizmann et al. (1980). Its type is "Prosansanosmilus peregrinus". It was assigned to "Nimravinae" by Heizmann et al. (1980); to "Felidae" by Carroll (1988); to "Barbourofelinae" by Bryant (1991); and to Barbourofelidae by Morlo et al. (2004) and Morlo (2006).
A new species, "P. eggeri" from the Middle Eocene locality of Sandelzhausen, Germany, was described in 2004. It differed from other European barbourofelids in having a more plesiomorphic ("ancestral") morphology, with less developed sabretooth adaptations and being smaller. However, the species is stratigraphically younger than "P. peregrinus"; and probably part of the African faunal immigration into Europe during the Middle Eocene.
Morphology.
Like all barbourofelids, "Prosansanosmilus" was very muscular, short legged and probably walked plantigrade (flat-footed). There are only two species of "Prosansanosmilus", which lived in Spain, France and Germany during the Late Miocene epoch.

Zach Hunter

Zach Hunter (born 1991) is an anti-slavery activist. When he was 12 years old, he launched Loose Change to Loosen Chains, a student-led effort to raise awareness and funds to end slavery. Hunter is the author of four books, "Be the Change" (Zondervan), "Generation Change" (Zondervan), "Lose Your Cool" (Zondervan), and "Chivalry" (Zonedervan). Born in Washington State, Hunter resides in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Inspiration.
When asked why he got involved as an abolitionist at such a young age, Hunter said "There are actually 27 million slaves in the world. I was really surprised to find that out," he said. "And I had all these emotions about it and I wasn't sure what to think about the idea of having modern slavery, you know. But I didn't think it was enough to just have emotions." Hunter took his emotions of anger and outrage and launched Loose Change to Loosen Chains. Through the campaign, students tell the stories of modern day slaves and collect loose change in yellow cups. The collected change is then used to help fund the work of abolitionist organizations such as Free the Slaves and International Justice Mission; educate and inspire other abolitionists and further the student-led effort. His hard-work ethic has inspired many younger people nationally to devote themselves to causes that matter.
Hunter cites Dr. Martin Luther King's peaceful revolution, the work of Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass as some of his inspiration. But foremost among his inspiration was William Wilberforce, the slavery abolitionist in England who lived almost 200 years ago. WIlliam Wilberforce was a devout Christian and knew John Newton, the slave trader who wrote the hymn, 'Amazing Grace.' What Wilberforce advocated, and what Hunter recognizes, is the love that God has for all of humanity. In light of His precious love, we should strive to let the whole world see that love and grace and mercy that He freely gives. Slavery should be a chief concern among us because of its degradation of humans who were made in the image of God.
Ongoing work.
In addition to his work combatting modern day slavery, Hunter is also working to mobilize a new generation of activists. Hunter describes the most serious problems he sees in the world today in his book "Generation Change" and profiles the work of other young people dedicated to solving the problems. Hunter speaks around the world to students, youth workers and activists. In addition to his published books, he is a frequent contributor to print and online periodicals including The Huffington Post. His most recent book is Chivalry which will be released in July 2013.

Raven (book)

Raven: The Untold Story of the Rev. Jim Jones and His People details the life and ultimate demise of Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple. Written by journalist Tim Reiterman, the book reviews the history of the Peoples Temple. The book includes numerous interviews, audio tapes and documents among its hundreds of sources.
Background.
In addition to covering the Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple in articles in the "San Francisco Examiner", Reiterman also accompanied Congressman Leo Ryan on his November 1978 investigative trip to Jonestown. While Reiterman was shot, he survived the Peoples Temple's attack on Ryan's delegation at an airstrip in Guyana.
Research.
During the course of his research for the book, Reiterman traveled to Indiana and visited locations where Jim Jones grew up and conducted interviews with local residents who knew him.
Contents.
The book describes the events that occurred in Jonestown, Guyana, where over 900 people lost their lives, which constituted the largest loss of American civilian life (other than due to natural disasters) in United States history until the events of September 11, 2001. The book further describes the investigation and death of Congressman Ryan.
Reception.
In 1983, "Raven" was recognized with the Thomas Thompson PEN Award for nonfiction. Marshall Kilduff of the "San Francisco Chronicle" wrote highly of the book and recommended it in a 2007 summer reading list: "This stands as the definitive history of Jim Jones and his bizarre Peoples Temple." Rob Morse of the "San Francisco Examiner" wrote: "The book is so definitive, it's tough going. It has no cheap thrills, just depressing shivers." In a review for the Associated Press, Lisa Levitt Ryckman called the book "the most comprehensive of the dozen written since Jones directed his followers in an orgy of suicide and murder", and in a subsequent article about Jonestown reiterated her position, and referred to the book as the "definitive book on Jones and Peoples Temple".
The book received a positive review in "Library Journal", and reviewer Barbara Conaty wrote: "This compelling, brutally convincing account is unlikely to be surpassed." Barbara Bright of "The New York Times Book Review" described the book as a "powerfully written and well-researched book, documenting a peculiarly American tragedy". A review in "Choice" called the book "Good supplementary reading for a number of college courses, and valuable for general adult reading, it is strongly recommended for all libraries," and commented "Reiterman's methods and sources are sufficiently described to certify Raven as a serious work." Herbert A. Michelson of "The Sacramento Bee" described "Raven" as : "a critically acclaimed study of the Peoples Temple".
Bob MacDonald of "The Boston Globe" characterized the book as an "excellent inquiry" into the deaths at Jonestown. In a review in "National Review", David Evanier wrote: "Raven does not explain Jones ... But through its accumulation of excellent details, he is understood by the book's end, without apology, exaggeration, superfluous information, or psychoanalysis." Jordan Robertson of the Associated Press called "Raven" the "seminal book on the Peoples Temple". Writing for the "San Francisco Chronicle", Michael Taylor characterized the work as an "exhaustive study", and Stephen G. Bloom of the "Sacramento Bee" called it "an exhaustive biography of Jim Jones".
"Raven" has been used as a reference in other books discussing the events surrounding Jonestown and Peoples Temple. Henry Warner Bowden used the book as a reference in the entry on Jim Jones in "Dictionary of American Religious Biography". Harold Barrett utilized "Raven" as a reference in his book "Rhetoric and Civility", and described it as "a thorough, highly detailed and documented account". Eugene V. Gallagher and W. Michael Ashcraft referenced the book in their work "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America", where they referred to it as "an engaging journalistic account".

Ridin' (Mýa song)

"Ridin'" is a song by American recording artist Mýa Harrison. It was written and composed by Harrison, Ester Dean, Jevon Simms, Traci Hale and Tricky Stewart for her fourth studio album "Liberation" (2007), the latter also serving as its producer. Lyrically, the contemporary R&B ballad is based on a personal experience and relationship Harrison was in at one point in time when she suspected her ex-boyfriend of cheating. 
"Ridin’" was released in favor over album cuts "I Am" and "Walka Not a Talka" in a poll on Harrison's MySpace page voted by fans and after the commercial disappointment of previous single "Lock U Down". Upon release, it received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who complimented on Harrison’s toned of voice and the topic of the song. A minor success on "Billboard"’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart however, it peaked at number fifty-seven. The song’s accompanying music video was filmed by Erik White and made its world premiere on BET’s "106 & Park" in September 2007.
Reception.
Critical.
In reviewing Ridin',Mark Edward Nero of "About.com" said, Stylistically, it's very similar to some songs on Usher's "Confessions" album, with the major difference being Mýa playing the cheated-on role instead of the cheater.

<doc id="19369956" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19369956" title="Juanacatlán">
Juanacatlán

Juanacatlán () is a town and "municipio" (municipality) in the central region of the Mexican state of Jalisco.
Origin of name.
Juanacatlán gets its name from the Nahuatl word "Xonacatlan", which means "place abundant in onions" or "onion place" (from "Xonaca" for onions and "Tlan" for place).
The hieroglyph of Juanacatlán includes the symbol of the Tlaxcala, representing the battles and the places where the Tlaxcaltecans went with the Nuño de Guzmán expedition, after the conquest of Mexico.
Seal.
The seal of Juanacatlán is based on the region's economic activities and history, and is divided into four parts:
The leaves that surround the seal are identical to those in the seal of Jalisco, whose people Juanacatlán joins as a national entity. The seal was approved by H. Cabildo de Juanacatlán in 1993. Its creation was the responsibility of the teacher María de Lourdes Torres Alaniz, from the Municipality of Juanacatlán.
History.
Although "place of onions" has been claimed to be a necessarily inappropriate translation of the indigenous name (as the onions were brought by the conquistadors), the origin of the name was in fact a different, native, plant- a type of jicama or "cebollita" as is commonly known in the region. The Jalisco writer Juan José Arreola translates the name as "place of the good onions".
In prehispanic times, the Xonacatlan region was part of the Tololotlán kingdom, which was itself part of the feudal Tonalá kingdom, one of four kingdoms that composed the Chimalhuacana federation.
In 1529, Nuño de Guzmán arrived in the area, while conquering the kingdoms of Tonalá and Xalisco. Later, the people of Coyula, Juanacatlán, Tatepozco and Tololotlán (because their populations were so small) were defeated. On March 25, 1530, Nuño de Guzmán took formal possession of the territory in the name of the Spanish monarch.
Beginning in 1531, the natives of the Xonacatlán region were converted and evangelized in the Christian faith by the religious order of San Francisco: Friar Antonio de Segovia, Fray Juan de Padilla, Fray Andrés de Córdova and Juan de Badillo. That same year, Father Segovia founded the convent of Our Lady of the Assumption in Tetlán, near modern-day Guadalajara.
Geography.
The municipio of Juanacatlán in the east-central part of the state, between 20º24’00’’ and 20º32’15’’ northern latitude and between 103º03’10’’ and 103º15’00’’ west latitude, at an altitude of 1,530m. 
It is bordered to the north by Tonalá and Zapotlanejo, to the south by Chapala and Poncitlán; to the east by Zapotlán del Rey, and to the west by Ixtlahuacán de los Membrillos, El Salto, and Tlajomulco de Zuñiga.
Climate.
The climate of the municipio is semi-dry in winter, with dry summers, and somewhat hot without a defined winter pattern. The average annual temperature is 20.1°C, and the average annual precipitation is 819.1 mm, with a rainy season from June to August.
The dominant winds are from the east, west, and south. There's an average of 12 freezing days per year.
Hydrography.
The region's hydrography includes the Santiago River, which surrounds much of the town, and the streams that flow in the rainy season: the Colorado, Buenavista Los Corteses, La Cruz, la Tinaja, El Gallo, El Puerto, Hondo, Miseria, Chiquito, Lomelines, and Limoncillo. 
There is also the Santiago River Channel and the irrigation channel deriving from the Corona Dam.
The municipio's water resources belong to the town Lerma-Chapala-Santiago basin and the Verde-Atotonilco sub-basin.
Since companies appearing in the industrial corridor of El Salto have polluted the waters, the waterfall that once attracted hundreds of visitors is now a hotbed of infection, with a terrible odor, worse in times of heat. This has led to the appearance of respiratory diseases, various cancers, and heart disease. The Rio Lerma and Rio Santiago have become the most serious threats among the populations of El Salto and Juanacatlan.
Natural Resources.
The region benefits from a natural wealth including a 933 ha forest with species such as oak, oak, ash and Tabachines, mainly. 
Its main mineral resources are sandbars. Among the species of fauna are mountain lions, rabbits, squirrels, skunks, foxes, snakes, coyotes and armadillos. The soils belong to the dominant type "Vertisol pélico" and "Regosol eútrico" and the associated soil type "Feozem háplico". 
In the forested region are species such as oak, giant oak, Tabachines and ash. There are also minor species such as: guamúchil, bell, captain, tepamé, mesquite, nopal, huizache, and a variety of fruit trees.
Economy.
The region's key local crops are maize and sorghum. It breeds cattle, producing meat and milk, and breeds pigs, sheep, goats, horses, poultry meat and postura and colmenas. The main branch of industry is manufacturing. 
Fishing in the Rio Santiago produces species such as catfish, lobina, carp and frog on a small scale for local consumption. 
The Juanacatlán Lagoon offers a landscape worthy of admiration, for the transparency of its water and vegetation, with a surrounding forest of conifers.
The municipal seat provides financial, professional, technical, communal, social, personal and maintenance services.

Black Jack Christian

Black Jack Christian, aka 202, or Ed Williams, (1856? - 1897) was an outlaw of the Old West.
Early life and outlaw activity.
Christian was born William Christian, in Logan County, Oklahoma. Very little is known about his youth and early life. He first appears in reports of outlaw activity in the late 1880s, along with his brother Bob Christian. He first earned the nickname "202" due to his large frame of build. However, he quickly became better known as "Black Jack" due to his tendency to have a short temper, and during this time, during the late 1880s and early 1890s, he and his brother Bob Christian organized the "High Fives Gang", operating mostly around New Mexico Territory.
In 1895, while the two brothers were in Guthrie, Oklahoma, they shot and killed a lawman, and were arrested, but escaped with the assistance of their gang. They fled to Arizona Territory, and on August 6, 1895, the gang robbed the "International Bank" in Nogales, Arizona. During their escape from town, gang member Jess Williams was shot and wounded by newspaper man Frank King, causing him to drop the money taken during the robbery, he also managed to drop his one and only gun earring he wore in his left ear. Williams, both Christian brothers, and gang member Bob Hays were able, however, to escape town.
Sheriff Bob Leatherwood of Tucson, Arizona pursued them with a posse, and engaged the gang in a shootout in Skeleton Canyon, during which Special Deputy Frank Robson was shot and killed. The gang again escaped, riding into Mexico, where they intended to remain for a time, hoping that lawmen would eventually stop their pursuit. In 1897, the gang returned to Arizona, where they committed several stagecoach robberies. A posse located them in a small canyon, and ambushed them, killing all four members of the gang. Their bodies were placed on display, and the canyon is now known locally as "Black Jack Canyon".

He also launched the most extensive advertising campaign ever seen in Central Illinois of that time, to promote the development of his town. In his advertisements, he told prospective buyers "The lack of local timber would be offset by the cheap coal that would be shipped in on rail from Indiana and stressed that local farmers and merchants would be at a distinct trading advantage". He dug a cistern and offered to stake a quarter interest in a steam powered mill. He also donated land for a church and burial sites. He also built his personal house in 1855 known today as the Matthew T. Scott House.

Paul Kuhr

Paul August Kuhr, III, (born on December 4, 1971, in Berwyn, Illinois, USA), is an American musician, vocalist, lyricist, author, and graphic designer. He is the singer and founding member for the band, Novembers Doom.
Music.
Starting the band in 1989, his vocal style for Novembers Doom consists both of clean vocals and death growls.
Other projects Kuhr has been involved in vary from thrash metal in the 1980s in the form of Laceration (with fellow founding Novembers Doom member Steve Nicholson), to the late symphonic doom band Em Sinfonia. He is also in the band Subterranean Masquerade, where he uses his growl, as well as his singing voice. Kuhr has also recorded his narrative vocals on the Draconian CD, Turning Season Within, and provided backing vocals on the track "Praise the Lowered" on the CD Deconstruction by Devin Townsend Project. Most recently, he has provided guest vocals on Funeral Doom band Broken Anatomy's second album, The Lazarus Regret.
Kuhr has also been credited as recording with the Chicago-based band Earthen, and most recently starting a new band (with fellow founding Novembers Doom member Steve Nicholson), a death metal band called These Are They.
Graphic design.
Kuhr has worked as a freelance designer, creating CD covers, promotional posters, CD and DVD packaging, and website design. He currently maintains the website for his own band, Novembers Doom. He has worked on CD artwork for bands such as Novembers Doom, Macabre, Antimatter, Skepticism, Bethlehem, Katatonia, Enter Self, Em Sinfonia, Gorgasm, Council of the Fallen, Necrophagia, Broken Hope, Michael Angelo Batio, Jungle Rot, Disinter and Shroud of Bereavement.
Family.
Kuhr is married to wife Arline, and together they have a daughter, Rhiannon Autumn. Rhiannon has been the topic of three Novembers Doom songs, "Autumn Reflection" and "Swallowed by the Moon" on The Pale Haunt Departure, and "Twilight Innocence" on The Novella Reservoir.
On July 1, 2013, after almost 20 years of marriage, both Kuhr and Arline have called it quits and separated. Kuhr and Arline continued to remain friends and continue to raise their daughter, Rhiannon.
Lyrics and health.
In 2006, Kuhr released a lyrical explanation book titled The Wayfaring Chronicles. Within the pages of this book, Kuhr explains the root of his personal style of lyrical writing. A lot of it comes from multiple issues described as a disease in his spine. The first and most serious is an advanced form of Spinal stenosis. This is a condition due to narrowing of the spinal cord causing nerve pinching which leads to extreme pain, limping, lack of feeling in the lower extremities, with the likeliness of lower paralysis over time. The discs in the spine are degenerating causing the vertebrae to close in on the spinal cord itself. The second is a condition known as Ankylosing Spondylitis. This is a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, hips, and possibly other joints. It causes inflammation of the spinal joints (vertebrae) that cause severe, chronic pain. In some cases, this inflammation can lead to new bone formation on the spine, causing the spine to fuse in a fixed, immobile position. Spondylitis is the same disease Mick Mars is currently suffering from. Presently, there is no known cure for either disease.
