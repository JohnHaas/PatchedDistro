2008–10 Thai political crisis

Since 2008, there has been an ongoing political crisis in Thailand in form of a conflict between the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) and the People's Power Party (PPP) governments of Prime Ministers Samak Sundaravej and Somchai Wongsawat, respectively, and later between the Democrat Party government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and the National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD). It is a continuation of the 2005–2006 political crisis, wherein the PAD protested against the Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The PAD's followers usually dress in yellow, called 'the yellow shirts', the royal color of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The UDD's followers dress in red, widely called 'the red shirts', known as the supporters of the deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
History.
The PPP won the December 2007 general election. Though it became the largest party in the House, it did not gain an absolute majority. However, PPP became the leading party when five other smaller parties, who had previously been allies of Thaksin Shinawatra, agreed to join the coalition government under Samak Sundaravej.
The coalition government vowed to amend the 2007 constitution they called undemocratic, prompting the PAD to resume protests against the constitutional amendment plan after having suspended its movement after the 2006 coup. The PAD protested that the amendment was aimed at revoking Thaksin's legal charges and the election fraud charges on PPP executive members. The Samak government finally suspended its amendment plan, yet the PAD vowed to continue their protest, calling for Samak Sundaravej's resignation, noting that during his election campaign, he had declared himself a nominee of Thaksin. The tension escalated when the PAD seized Government House.
Samak was forced to resign in September after the Constitutional Court found him guilty of being hired and paid by a cooking TV program after he became the prime minister. PPP deputy leader Somchai Wongsawat, vice president of PPP and a brother-in-law of Thaksin, was elected by the members of parliament and became the new prime minister. This change prompted a continuation of PAD protests. The protests led to violent clashes between the police, the PAD, and anti-PAD protesters on 7 October as the government aimed to disperse them from blocking the entrances of the House. Consequently, a PAD protester was killed due to a grenade near the premier's office, while a member of the PAD security forces was killed when his car exploded prematurely. Many protesters were also injured.
As the PAD was attacked, the PAD then stepped up their protests by seizing the government's temporary offices at Don Muang Airport, and the seizure and closure of Suvarnabhumi Airport after the arrest of Chamlong Srimuang, one of its leaders. The sieges ended in December due to the verdict of the Constitutional Court, which dissolved the PPP and banned its executive board from political office after finding it guilty of election fraud. The Constitutional Court dissolved two coalition partners of the PPP on similar charges, which broke the coalition apart. Prime minister Somchai resigned.
It is alleged that the army then urged MPs of a former PPP faction, the Friends of Newin Group, and MPs of the former PPP coalition partners to cross the aisle and form a coalition with the Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva. After days of negotiations, Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the Democrat Party, was voted in eventually by a margin of 235 in favor and 198 against.
PPP members and its supporters, UDD, then protested Abhisit's rise to power and engaged in a mass protest in Bangkok in April 2009. The Government's House was under siege again and main roads, intersections and entrances to hospitals were blocked in downtown Bangkok.
The protest also took place in Pattaya, the site of the planned Fourth East Asia Summit. After clashes with security forces and government supporters called 'the blue-shirts', the Thaksin loyalists eventually stormed the hotel, disrupting the Fourth East Asia Summit in Pattaya. A state of emergency was then declared in Pattaya while protests in Bangkok became more violent. The next day the government arrested the leaders of the Pattaya protest, causing unrest at the Supreme Court and the Interior Ministry, where prime minister Abhisit was declaring the State of Emergency in Bangkok. The protesters finally stormed the ministry, 'hunting' the premier and ministers. The premier's secretary and several guards were injured. The situation became more intense in the evening after the government called in the military forces to secure the capital. The military forces began disbanding the protests on main roads. Violent clashes, burning buses, and wheels were seen in downtown. Clashes between the red-shirts and the 'Bangkokians' took place in many areas as the red-shirts tried to storm their homes, burning wheels and blocking the railway. The protesters claimed that at least two Bangkokians were shot dead in downtown, the charge was denied by the authority as there was no strong evidence supporting the charge. Eventually, on 14 April, the leaders of the red-shirts decided to end their protest at the Government House.
The People's Alliance for Democracy, comprising media activists, social activists, academics, and leaders of worker's unions, is opposed to what it calls the "Thaksin system", which is seen by some as the Thaksin' 'autocracy'; in what has been described as his domination of independent supervisory institutions and violations of human rights and the freedom of the press. It began the mass protest against Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 after the removal of the critical TV program of Sondhi Limthongkul. In 2008, the PAD accused Samak Sundaravej and Somchai Wongsawat of being proxies for Thaksin. Samak had announced that he was Thaksin's nominee during his election campaign, Somchai is Thaksin's brother-in-law, and several new Pheu Thai Party members are former TRT/PPP members. The PAD is opposed to all attempts to reform the constitution in ways that would allow politicians banned from political office to re-enter politics, and to revoking the charges against Thaksin. The PAD has also called for "New Politics", a 'new age of politics, free from the corrupted politicians'. In May 2009, the PAD founded its party, the New Politics Party. One of the PAD's major aims is to oppose what it considers as the anti-monarchy movement, supposedly among some Thaksin supporters. PAD has promoted the role of the king as the 'guard' of the all people's power against the 'corrupted politician'. That is why the PAD uses the colour of yellow, the Rama IX's symbolic colour of his birthday, Monday, as its brand. Yet its ideology was blasted by some critics as 'anti-democratic'.
The National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship is the group consisting of mainly social activists, scholars, and Thaksin supporters which opposes the 2006 coup deposing Thaksin Shinawatra. It believes that the coup was supported by powerful persons, the 'elites' or 'nobles', targeting Prem Tinsulanonda, the Chief of the royal Privy Council. The UDD aims to topple the "amatayathipatai" (government run by traditional elites, nobles, and the bureaucratic polity). In the April 2009 protest, its aims were the immediate resignation of the prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and members of the Privy Council Prem Tinsulanonda and Surayud Chulanont as well as fresh elections. It also demanded that charges be brought against the PAD for the 2008 airport seizures and unrest. Several members of Parliament in the Pheu Thai Party are public in their support of UDD, as well as of Thaksin Shinawatra himself.
In early 2010 a series of events occurred in which the situation escalated. On 26 February, assets worth 46 billion Thai baht were seized from former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. On the evening of 27 February, M67 grenades were thrown from a motorcycle outside three branches of Bangkok Bank. By mid-March "red shirt" protesters, composed mainly of Thaksin supporters, had moved into Bangkok. Although relatively peaceful in nature, human blood donated by some of the protesters was poured outside parliament. On 10 April, the protesters took control of a TV broadcasting station causing Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to vow to restore Thailand to normalcy. Clashes between protesters and military had resulted in 18 fatalities (both civilian and military) and over 800 injured by 11 April. On 22 April, a series of explosions in Bangkok killed at least three people and injured 75 more, including four foreigners. At least some of the explosions were caused by grenades, which the government claimed had been fired from the Red Shirt encampment.
Origins of the crisis.
The 2008 crisis had its roots in the 2005–2006 Thai political crisis, the 2005 elections and 2006 elections, the 2006 coup, and the 2007 general election.
Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai party (TRT) won a landslide victory in the 2001 election, the first elections held under the Thai Constitution of 1997. Thaksin's grassroots economic policies helped reduce poverty and provided universal health care, making him hugely popular in rural Thailand. His drug policies were effective at reducing drug use but were attacked for the large number of extrajudicial executions that resulted. He was accused of conflicts of interest due to his family's continued holdings in Shin Corporation, the telecoms business that he founded prior to becoming Premier. Despite this, he became the first politician in Thai history to finish his term. Thaksin's re-election in 2005 election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history.
Media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul had been a staunch supporter of Thaksin until major losses at state-owned Krung Thai Bank caused CEO Viroj Nualkhair to be fired. Viroj was Sondhi's former banker and had forgiven Sondhi for billions in bad personal debts. Sondhi's levied public criticisms of Thaksin on his TV show and his media outlets, the Manager Daily newspaper and ASTV.
Sondhi's People's Alliance for Democracy soon gathered supporters among Dhammayuttika Nikaya disciples of Luang Ta Maha Bua, prominent socialites and members of the Thai royal family who claimed that Thaksin frequently insulted King Bhumibol Adulyadej, several state-enterprise unions who were against Thaksin's state-enterprise privatization plans, and various factions in the Royal Thai Army who claimed that Thaksin promoted only those who were loyal to him. The movement gained in popularity after Thaksin's family sold their share in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings, while making use of a regulation that exempted individuals from paying capital gains tax. The PAD led protests demanding that Thaksin pay additional taxes, despite the SEC and the Revenue Department saying that no wrong was done.
The protests escalated. In February 2006, Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratglin started secretly planning for a military coup, despite regular denials. On 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must obey the orders of the King – not the Government.
The coup was executed on 19 September 2006 while Thaksin was attending a UN summit, just weeks before a planned Parliamentary election. The junta canceled the elections, abrogated the Constitution, dissolved Parliament, banned protests and all political activities, suppressed and censored the media, declared martial law, and arrested Cabinet members. The PAD voluntarily dissolved after announcing that its goals had been accomplished. Surayud Chulanont, Prem's former close aide, was appointed Prime Minister. A junta-appointed court banned the TRT and 111 of its executives from politics for five years. Privy Council President Prem harshly criticized Thaksin, who was in exile, comparing him to Adolf Hitler. A junta-appointed committee drafted a substantially revised constitution. Elections were scheduled for December 2007. Many TRT politicians moved to the People's Power Party. The PPP won the December elections and nominated Samak Sundaravej as Premier.
2008 resumption of PAD protests.
The Samak Sundaravej government, elected in the December 2007 general elections, came under pressure to resign since May 2008, when the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) reformed and staged regular street protests. They protested the government’s proposals to amend the 2007 constitution, claiming that Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and his government are acting as a proxy for former deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The PAD also criticized the Samak government's decision to support the Cambodian government's application for the listing of the disputed Preah Vihear Temple as a World Heritage site. Tensions rose between Thailand and Cambodia as the PAD called for Thai investors to withdraw from Cambodia, the closure of all 40 Thai-Cambodian border checkpoints, a ban on all flights from Thailand to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, the construction of a naval base at Koh Kut near the border, and the abolition of the committee which oversees demarcation of overlapping sea areas and the unilateral declaration of a Thai marine map.
In late June, the opposition filed a no-confidence motion in parliament, which the government survived. The PAD proposed that the constitution be amended to reduce the proportion of elected members of Parliament. This would disenfranchise the rural population, which the PAD viewed as being insufficiently educated to vote for anti-Thaksin Shinawatra parties.
Siege of Government House.
Tensions escalated to crisis when on Tuesday 26 August the protesters stormed and occupied the grounds of the Government House, displacing the prime minister from his offices. Another armed group attacked the headquarters of the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand, while the offices of three ministries were also partially invaded. Major roads into Bangkok were blocked by PAD supporters. Prime Minister Samak remained defiant, refusing to resign, while also vowing not to violently remove the protesters. Despite a court warrant for the arrest of the PAD’s nine leaders and a Civil Court order to evacuate, the PAD remained firmly lodged in the government compound. Friday 29th saw semi-violent clashes at various protest sites between protesters and riot police, who were still largely unable to control the group.
Transport infrastructure was disrupted beginning 29 August, with state railway workers union, the PAD's alliance, was on strike partially disabling train services. PAD demonstrators occupied the runways of and closed down airports in the southern cities of Hat Yai, Phuket and Krabi. (The airports later reopened on the 30th and 31st.) The State Enterprise Worker’s Union threatened to disrupt public infrastructure services including electricity, waterworks, airline, bus, port and communications services, beginning with police and government offices, on 3 September.
Prime Minister Samak called an emergency session of parliament on 31 August to resolve the issue, but refused to dissolve parliament as suggested by the opposition. Meanwhile, pro-Thaksin protesters calling themselves the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship of Thailand (UDDT) began to gather in Sanam Luang.
September 2008 state of emergency.
One week after the PAD began occupation of the Government House grounds, violence erupted as members of the UDDT clashed with the PAD in a melee involving firearms, resulting in 43 injuries and at least one death. Prime Minister Samak, by virtue of the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situation, BE 2548 (2005), declared a state of emergency in Bangkok at 07.00 hours of the following morning.
Sundaravej also put Gen Anupong Paochinda, Army Commander in Chief, in charge of the remedy of the said State of Emergency, and appointed Pol Gen Patcharavat Wongsuwan, National Police Commander in Chief, and Lt Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, 1st Army Area Commander as assistants to Gen Anupong. He also issued bans on the gathering or assemblage of more than five persons within the Bangkok Metropolis; on the nationwide press release, distribution or dissemination of letters, publications or any other information containing the matters which may instigate apprehension amongst the people or is intended to distort information in order to mislead an understanding of the State of Emergency to the extent of affecting the security of state or public peace and order or good moral of the people; and on other matters which were a kind of public rights and liberties restriction.
However, on the same day, Mr Nitithon Lamluea, a member of Thailand Lawyer Council’s Human Rights Committee, lodged with the Supreme Administrative Court a complaint against Prime Minister Samak accusing him of abuse of power as he imposed a state of emergency in Bangkok, but the circumstances on 2 September were not what was prescribed in said Emergency Decree as being a State of Emergency. The complaint also requested the Court to revoke the State of Emergency. Tej Bunnag, then the Minister of Foreign Affairs, resigned from office as he disagreed with the Government’s measures to remedy the crisis and felt uneasy in representing the Government to foreigners when explaining the prevailing circumstances to them.
On 14 September, the Government issued an Announcement revoking the State of Emergency throughout Bangkok together with all the pertinent announcements, orders, and articles.
Fall of Samak.
In 9 September 2008, the Constitutional Court of Thailand found that Samak had hosted and received payment for hosting two cooking TV shows, "Tasting and Grumbling" and "All Set at 6 am," for a few months after he had become Prime Minister. He had been hosting the shows for years prior to becoming Premier. Section 267 of the 2007 Constitution of Thailand forbids members of the Cabinet from being employees of any person; this was to prevent conflicts of interest. The court found that although Samak was a contractor to the show's producers, and did not fit the definition of the term "employee" as defined under the Civil and Commercial Code, the law on labour protection or the law on taxation, the spirit of the Constitution gave a broader definition to the term. It thus found Samak guilty of breaching the Constitution and terminated his Premiership.
A session of the House of Representatives was held on 12 September to vote for a new prime minister. The People Power Party decided to renominate Samak as Premier (he had stopped hosting the TV shows earlier that year and thus was no longer an employee). The session was cut short because the House lacked a quorum. The nomination of a new Prime Minister was postponed until 17 September, where the PPP successfully nominated Deputy Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat as Premier.
Reactions to court decision.
Karn Tienkaew, deputy leader of Samak’s People Power Party, said the party planned to propose a parliamentary vote Wednesday on returning Samak to power: "Samak still has legitimacy. The party still hopes to vote him back unless he says no. Otherwise we have many other capable candidates."
On 10 September 2008, however, the PPP shied away from their earlier statement they would renominate Sundaravej and was apparently looking for an alternative candidate instead; the new PM was to be nominated on 12 September 2008.
People Power Party’s deputy spokesman Kuthep Suthin Klangsang, on 12 September 2008, announced that: "Samak has accepted his nomination for prime minister. Samak said he is confident that parliament will find him fit for office, and that he is happy to accept the post. A majority of party members voted Thursday to reappoint Samak. Samak is the leader of our party so he is the best choice." Despite objections from its coalition partners, the PPP, in an urgent meeting, unanimously decided to renominate Samak Sundaravej. 5 coalition parties, namely Chart Thai, Neutral Democratic, Pracharaj, Puea Pandin and Ruam Jai Thai Chart Pattana, unanimously agreed to support the People Power party (PPP) to set up the new government and vote for the person who should be nominated as the new prime minister. Chart Thai deputy leader Somsak Prissananantakul and Ruam Jai Thai Chart Pattana leader Chettha Thanajaro said the next prime minister who will be nominated on Friday. Caretaker prime minister Somchai Wongsawat said PPP secretary-general Surapong Suebwonglee will notify the 5 parties who the PPP nominates to take office again. Some lawmakers, however, said they will propose an alternate candidate. Meanwhile, Thailand’s army chief Gen. Anupong Paochinda said he backed the creation of a unity government that would include all the country’s parties, and he also asked for the lifting of a state of emergency that Samak imposed on 2 September.
On 12 September 2008, the quorum for selecting the new PM was not reached and the decision was delayed to 17 September 2008 in an event seen as signaling the end of Samak’s career. After its four coalition partners stated they'd prefer someone else to become PM instead of Samak, the PPP agreed to drop his nomination. Embattled Samak Sundaravej abandoned his bid to regain his Thailand Prime Minister post, and Teerapon Noprampa said Samak would also give up the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP) leadership. Meanwhile, PPP’s chief party spokesman Kudeb Saikrachang and Kan Thiankaew announced on 13 September that caretaker prime minister Somchai Wongsawat, caretaker justice minister Sompong Amornwiwat, and PPP Secretary-General Surapong Suebwonglee were PPP’s candidates for the premiership. However, Suriyasai Katasila of People's Alliance for Democracy (a group of royalist businessmen, academics, and activists), vowed to continue its occupation of Government House if a PPP candidate would be nominated: "We would accept anyone as prime minister, as long as he is not from the PPP."
The ruling People Power Party, on 15 September 2008, named Somchai Wongsawat, as its candidate for prime minister to succeed Samak Sundaravej. Somchai Wongsawat was ratified by the National Assembly of Thailand as Prime Minister of Thailand on 17 September, winning 263 votes against 163 votes for Abhisit Vejjajiva.
October violence.
Chamlong's arrest.
On 4 and 5 October 2008, respectively, Chamlong Srimuang and rally organizer, Chaiwat Sinsuwongse, of People's Alliance for Democracy, were detained by the Thai police on charges of insurrection, conspiracy, illegal assembly, and refusing orders to disperse (treason) against each of them and eight other protest leaders. At the Government House, Sondhi Limthongkul, however, stated that demonstrations would continue.
Clashes and the siege of Parliament.
Armed with batons, PAD forces surrounded Parliament and used razor wire barricades to prevent the legislature from meeting to hear Samak's replacement, Somchai Wongsawat, formally announce his policies. The government decided to crack down on the protesters. Police used tear gas but many bullets were fired at the protesters. Many protesters got seriously wounded; some even lost legs, causing over a hundred injuries. One additional PAD leader was killed, claimed by the police, when the bomb in his car went off in front of the headquarters of the Chart Thai Party, a member of the government coalition. Several protesters lost their hands and legs, although it was not clear whether these injuries were caused by tear gas rounds or the ping-pong grenades. Pornthip Rojanasunand, Director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, claimed that the loss of one particular PAD member's leg could not have been the result of tear gas usage, but came from a more powerful explosion. After viewing photographs of Angkhana Radappanyawut's injuries, Pornthip Rojanasunand suggested unequivocally that the death was caused by the explosion of a tear gas canister. She also stated that there was no need to conduct further investigations into the death and injuries of protesters because it became clear that they were caused by weapons of police. Investigations took place while charges against the police and government were filed by many protesters.
Afterwards, Doctor Suthep Kolcharnwit of Chulalongkorn Hospital led a campaign calling for doctors to refuse medical care to police injured during the clashes as a protest against the violence. Doctors from several major Bangkok hospitals joined him in his campaign. Doctor Suthep Kolcharnwit of the Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine along with several doctors from also refused to provide medical care to police injured in the clash, and urged doctors of other hospitals to boycott police as well.
After the violent crash, the demonstrators returned; the siege of the parliament was given up in the evening. Yet demonstrators started the siege of police headquarters near the Government House. The demonstrators called for the counter-attack on police force, then new clash erupted, causing the death of a female protester and injury of several protesters. The PAD leaders called the demonstrators to return to the Government House and limit the protest only at their 'stronghold', at the House, avoid using violence. Then calm returned to Bangkok.
Queen's appearance.
On 13 October 2008, Queen Sirikit presided over the funeral ceremony of Angkhana Radappanyawut, the PAD supporter who had been killed by police during the protests. The Queen was accompanied by her youngest daughter, Princess Chulabhorn, Army Chief Anupong Paochinda, Opposition Leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, and many high-ranked officials, but there were no signs of any police personnel. The Queen received a jubilant welcome from thousands of PAD supporters.
She spoke with the deceased's father, Jinda Radappanyawut, who later said she was concerned for the welfare of the protesters and "would soon send us flowers". Her Majesy told Angsana's parents that their daughter had sacrificed her life for the sake of the monarchy, and that she was a good person.
Previously, the revered Queen had donated ฿1 million to cover the medical expenses of those injured on both sides in the clashes. The protesters tried to claim the financial donation as a gesture of support for them, though in reality it went to aid injured policemen as well. The King also made a financial contribution to the dead woman's family.
Since the Queen's appearance was without precedent in modern times, many academicians and media deemed them to be "unusual" and perhaps an "explicit royal backing to a five-month street campaign to oust the elected government". Historian David Streckfuss of the University of Wisconsin–Madison noted that no Thai social activists slain in the previous decade had had royal attendance at their funerals, "so it is interesting to note that in this case—a conflict that is controversial and ongoing—that a member of the royalty should apparently show support."
Yet one could claim in support of the PAD that really was there was a small 'anti-monarchy' movement which supported Thaksin. This disturbed many monarchists. Sondhi Limthongkul, forefront leader of PAD, had claimed this since 2005, when he started criticizing Thaksin Shinawatra for his 'inappropriate' act defaming the monarchy when Thaksin held a religious ceremony at the royal temple of Wat Phra Kaeo. Eer since, PAD has accused Thaksin's followers as being 'anti-monarchy'. The UDD's and Thaksin's harsh attack on Prem Tinsulanonda, head of royal Privy Council and close advisor of the king, has been seen as a contradiction of Thai tradition and a hidden attempt to make a regime change. Moreover a leader of UDD, such Jakrapob Penkair has engaged in public criticism of the role of the monarchy, mostly, seen 'negatively'. Several UDD leaders were also charged and arrested and accused of insulting the monarchy, a crime under Thai criminal law. The PAD, therefore, has always claimed that it was defending the most revered institution according to the Constitutions, blasting UDD and Thaksin Shinawatra as anti-monarchist. The controversial issue of the monarchy has been then one of the fierce causes among these factions' supporters.
Airport seizures.
Protest at Suvarnabhumi International Airport and closures of airports.
On the evening of Tuesday 25 November 2008, the PAD executed what they called "Operation Hiroshima." A convoy of hundreds of armed PAD members dressed in yellow blocked the two ends of the road in front of the terminal building of Suvarnabhumi International Airport, Bangkok's main airport and an important regional hub and blockaded the main road to the airport, aiming at resisting the landing of the prime minister's flight. . PAD forces quickly overpowered hundreds of policemen armed with riot gear. PAD leaders mounted a mobile stage and proceeded to criticize the government. PAD members armed with clubs, iron bars and knives, with some wearing black balaclavas, then entered the terminal, much to the surprise of the thousands of travellers inside.
Official closure of the airport.
PAD forces also forced their way into the control tower, demanding the flight plan for Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat's return from the APEC summit in Peru. Somchai flew into Bangkok Don Muang airport on the evening of 25 November 2008 before flying on to Chiang Mai. After hours of turmoil, the Airports of Thailand, AOT, eventually decided that all Suvarnabhumi flights were suspended, leaving thousands of travelers stranded in the airport., this action led to the official closure of the airport later.
The government called on the Royal Thai Army to restore order at the airport. The Army did not follow the orders. In a press conference on 26 November, Army Commander General Anupong Paochinda proposed that the PAD withdraw from the airport and that the government resign. He also proposed that if the PAD did not comply, that they be subject to "social sanctions", whereas if the government did not comply, that the bureaucracy stop implementing government orders. A written copy of the proposal was sent to the government. Neither the PAD or the government complied with the proposal.
At 4:30 am on the morning of 26 November, three explosions were heard on the fourth floor of Suvarnbumi on the outside of the passenger terminal. Another explosion was reported at 6 am. Several people were injured. It was not clear who set off the explosions. The PAD did not allow the police or forensics experts to investigate the explosions.
Attempts to evict the PAD.
Also on 26 November, the Civil Court issued an injunction ordering the PAD to leave the Suvarnabhumi International Airport immediately. Notices of the injunction were placed on the front doors of the houses of the 13 PAD leaders. The PAD did not comply with the injunction.
On the evening of 27 November, the government declared a state of emergency around the two occupied airports and ordered police to clear out PAD forces. The state of emergency allowed the military to ban public gatherings of more than five people. The Navy was assigned to aid police at Suvarnabhumi, while the Air Force was assigned to aid police at Don Muang. The Army's spokesman noted, "The army disagrees with using troops to resolve the problem. The army does not want to do that, and it is not appropriate to do that."
The PAD was defiant. PAD leader Suriyasai Katasila announced that the PAD would fight off police. "If the government wants to clear the protesters, let it try. The PAD will protect all locations because we are using our rights to demonstrate peacefully without causing damages to state properties or rioting," Suriyasai said. Suriyasai also threatened to use human shields if police attempted to disperse the PAD.
On the morning of 28 November, PAD leader Chamlong Srimuang announced to PAD forces that he had received a call from an unspecified "senior person" (ผู้ใหญ่ท่านหนึ่ง) telling him to end the rallies. But he refused to do what the senior person told him. "For the past 108 days, the Alliance has protested together under hardship, while another group of people has remained in comfort. They can't just suddenly ask us to stop protesting," he told the assembled forces. Addressing supporters on ASTV, Sondhi said, "If we have to die today, I am willing to die. This is a fight for dignity."
Police manned checkpoints on roads leading to the airport. At one checkpoint, police found 15 home-made guns, an axe, and other weapons in a Dharma Army six-wheel truck taking 20 protesters to Suvarnabhumi airport. One checkpoint, about 2 kilometers from the airport, was attacked by armed PAD forces in vehicles, causing the police to withdraw. Police Senior Sgt Maj Sompop Nathee, an officer from the Border Patrol Police Region 1, later returned to the scene of the clash and was detained by PAD forces. He was interrogated by Samran Rodphet, a PAD leader, and then detained inside the airport. Reporters and photographers tried to follow Sompop to his interrogation, but PAD forces did not allow them. PAD supporters were moved from Government House to the airport.
With the exception of one airplane leaving for the Hajj, no flights with passengers were allowed for eight days. The PAD was apologetic to inconvenienced travelers in the airports and offered them food.
End of the siege.
Shortly after the Constitutional Court dissolved the three parties of the government coalition on 2 December 2008, the PAD held a press conference where they announced that they were ending all of their protests as of 10 am local time (GMT 7+) on 3 December 2008. "We have won a victory and achieved our aims," said Sondhi Limthongkul.
Flights from Suvarnabhumi resumed on 4 December, when a Thai Airways flight departed for Sydney, Australia. Thai Airways expected to have five other international flights departing on 4 and 5 December to New Delhi, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Seoul, and Copenhagen. Passengers for these flights had to check in at a convention centre outside the airport.
Views on the seizure.
Democrat Party.
Democrat Party MP for Sukhothai, Samphan Benchaphon, said of the airport seizure that the PAD "have the right to do it." Democrat Party MP for Bangkok, Thawil Praison, said that the PAD "could seize the airport and doing so is not excessive. The entire world understands that this is a normal matter in the struggle of democratic countries."
International reactions.
The governments of China, France, New Zealand, Singapore, Britain, the United States, Australia, and Japan warned their citizens to avoid Thailand and steer clear of protesters at the airport.
The European Union urged the protesters to peacefully leave the airports. EU ambassadors to Thailand wrote in a joint statement that the demonstrators are hurting Thailand's image and economy, continuing "While respecting the right of protesting and without interfering in any way with the internal political debate in Thailand, the EU considers that these actions are totally inappropriate".
US State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said that occupying the airports was "not an appropriate means of protest" and that the PAD should "walk away from the airports peacefully."
Closure of Bangkok Don Muang Airport.
On the night of 26 November 2008, the services at the Don Mueang Airport were stopped after the People's Alliance for Democracy seized control of the domestic passenger terminal.
A bomb exploded near a bunker made of tires near the main entrance to the passenger terminal at Don Muang Airport at 3.55 am on 30 November. Before the explosion occurred, about seven gunshots were heard from the direction of a warehouse deeper inside the airport compound. No one was injured in the explosion. It was not clear who or what set the bomb off.
A plainclothes policewoman at the airport was identified and captured by PAD security forces and forced onto the main PAD stage inside the airport. Angry PAD protesters threw water at her and many tried to hit her. She was eventually allowed to leave the airport.
Constitutional Court ruling on parties' dissolution.
Prior to the decision.
In December 2008, the Constitutional Court was scheduled to rule on whether or not to dissolve the PPP, Chart Thai, and Matchima Thippatai parties on electoral fraud charges. If the parties were dissolved, executives of the parties could have their political rights stripped for five years. However, non-executive MPs of the parties have the right to change parties for a period of time after the court decision. 37 PPP executives were also MPs, although 8 had resigned, leaving only 14. If the PPP was to be dissolved, the number of MPs they have would fall from 233 to 219. Out of Chart Thai's 43 executives, 19 of them are MPs. No Matchima executives are MPs. Thus, if the Constitutional Court dissolved all three parties, the government coalition would reduce in size to 283 out of a total of 447 MPs in Parliament – a majority is 224. The opposition Democrat Party has only 164 MPs. If all the non-PPP parties allied with the Democrats, they would have a total of 228 MPs – only 4 MPs above a majority.
The site for the court decision was changed from the Constitutional Court to the Supreme Administrative Court after UDD supporters surrounded the Constitution Court. The Supreme Administrative court was protected by Royal Thai Army troops armed with M16 rifles. The Constitutional Court handed down its decision immediately after hearing closing comments from the Chart Thai party.
Summary of decision.
Prior to the delivery of decision, judge Chat Chonlaworn, President of the nine-judge panel, remarked that:
Following the decision.
Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat was, therefore, disqualified by the Court's decision, and replaced in a caretaker capacity by Chaovarat Chanweerakul, the Deputy Prime Minister.
The PPP issued a statement calling the ruling a "judicial coup", and called into question the court's procedures, for instance, allowing all the PPP's witnesses only 2 hours to speak. It also noted that the wife of one of the judges was an active PAD member, and said that these and other irregularities would likely lead the Thai people to call the integrity of the court into question and see the ruling as an alternative means of accomplishing a coup. Former PPP MPs and members founded the For Thais Party to prepare for the event that the PPP should be banned, and PPP members immediately started joining the For Thais Party.
Reelections for the 26 constituencies of the banned executive members from the three parties were held on 11 December 2008.
On 6 December 2008, the opposition Democrat Party announced it had garnered sufficient support from former coalition partners of PPP and their splinters to be able to form a government, while For Thais claimed the same, adding that it had already been joined by more than a third of MPs. The coalition partners of the Democrat Party appeared to be most of the dissolved parties, the Thai Nation Party and the Neutral Democratic Party, as well as the Thais United National Development Party, the For the Motherland party, and the "Friends of Newin" faction, a splinter of the banned PPP.
On 15 December 2008, Abhisit Vejjajiva was elected the new Prime Minister. Army commander and co-leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, was widely reported to have coerced PPP MPs to defect to the Democrat Party. PAD leader Khamnoon Sitthisamarn and junta-appointed Senator called Abhisit's premiership a "genuine PAD victory" and a "Anupong-style coup d'etat." The circumstances of his ascent to power closely linked Abhisit to the Bangkok elite, the Army, and the Royal Palace.
April 2009 protest.
Accusations against Prem Tinsulanonda and the beginning of protests.
In March 2009, Thaksin Shinawatra claimed via video broadcast that Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda masterminded the 2006 military coup, and that Prem and fellow Privy Councilor members Surayud Chulanont and Chanchai Likhitjittha conspired with the military to ensure that Abhisit became Premier. Although Abhisit denied the accusations, hundreds of thousands protested in Bangkok early April demanding that Abhisit resign from the Premiership and that Prem, Surayud, and Chanchai resign from the Privy Council. Thaksin openly called for a "peoples revolution" to overthrow the "amatayathipatai" with slogan "Khon Ammat' Down the Nobles' bureaucratic policy; government run by traditional or noble elites or royal advisors) influences of the Abhisit government.
However the police found and arrested a suspect charged with assassination plot of Chanchai Likhitjittha in early April.
UDD and Thaksin Shinawatra's supporters eventually began their mass protest on Wednesday 8 April with 100,000 demonstrators were at Government House and the nearby Royal Plaza by the evening.
Thaksin Shinawatra vowed to phone in, supporting the protesters. The aim of the protesters as they said, was to 'topple' the 'Elites or Nobles Regime', or 'Amatyathipatai', accused of meddling politics, a controversial issue for the monarchists or royalists, particularly the PAD supporters, believing 'anti-monarchists' movement, ex-communist party members, working within UDD and Thaksin's supporters. Therefore the movement of UDD has also been seen as an 'anti-royalist' movement by several critics.
The protesters also urged a revoking of the 2007 Constitution. They also called for the resignation of Abhisit, dissolution of the parliament, and an immediate election.
Violence against the Abhisit government in April.
The early signs of a violent move against the new government was seen from early April. On 7 April, while Abhisit was in his automobile, returning from the site of planned the ASEAN Summit, a group of Thaksin supporters' in red shirts followed and tried to stop his escort. The dramatic scene took place when the premier's car was stopped by the police due to the 'red light' at the intersection. Suddenly a policeman asked the premier to change his car from an armored car to another auto. Suddenly the red-shirts who reached and could even hit his car, broke the glass on the back of his car. However the premier's escort and the premier himself were able to escape safely.
Pattaya protests.
The protests, led by the red-shirted National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) expanded to Pattaya, the site of the 14th ASEAN summit a barricade blocking the transport of foreign leaders. The Peoples Republic of China's leader was blocked from leaving his hotel by the protesting taxi drivers, Thaksin's supporters.
In the afternoon, while the red-shirted protesters were heading to the hotel, the site of the summit, violent clashes occurred between the UDD and blue-shirted government supporters on the way to the hotel. "The Straits Times" reported that both sides used sticks, stones, clubs, molotov cocktails, and "small bombs" in the clashes. The protests and clashes escalated. The red-shirted protesters finally stormed the hotel building, causing the summit to be cancelled. Abhisit declared a state of emergency in the areas of Pattaya and Chonburi on 11 April. Visiting leaders were evacuated from the venue by helicopter to a nearby military airbase that had been Suvarnabhumi's replacement during the PAD's airport sieges of 2008. Legislation authorizing emergency decrees was originally drafted and pushed through Parliament in 2005 by the Thaksin government, provoking charges of authoritarianism at the time by the Democrats. The decree was used previously by Samak's government, coping with PAD protest. After military personnel took control, the red-shirt demonstrators returned and dispersed.
Bangkok unrest.
As the week-long Songkran (Thai New Year) holiday began, protests escalated in Bangkok. Protesters in red shirts used cars, buses, and in one location LPG tankers to take control of several locations in central Bangkok. Small clashes began apparently between anti-government and government supporters, and the general population. At a demonstration in front of Prem's residence, an angry woman wearing a yellow shirt, the royal color, plunged her car into a crowd of UDD protesters before driving away. Abhisit declared a state of emergency for Bangkok and surrounding areas due to the heightened escalation of tension and denounced the anti-government protesters as "national enemies". These clashes emerged in locations where control had been taken over by the demonstrators.
Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared another state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding areas on 12 April 2009. Abhisit also issued a decree that empowered the government to censor television broadcasts. A television journalist reported that he was ordered not to show images damaging to the military or government. Thaksin, who daily showed his live broadcast on a D-Station television, showing support for his loyalists, calling for the overthrow of the government, now began to urge the King Bhumibol to intervene and end the showdown.
Ministry of Interior riot.
On 12 April, the tension ran high after the authority arrested leaders of the red-shirts who stormed the summit site in Pattaya. The protesters began to block of the Criminal Court, aiming at releasing their leader. In the afternoon, after the declaration of state emergency at the Ministry of Interior, hundreds of protesters who had blocked the gates of the Ministry, eventually broke out the ministry's gates. Abhisit and members of his cabinet were followed by the protesters. The premier's car and his secretary's car were under siege and hit. Abhisit escaped safely while his secretary and his driver became victimized, and their car's windows were all broken. Among those with serious injuries were some of the premier's security guards who were military, one of them was 'held' and was 'presented' to the red protesters on their stage.
Despite the state of emergency, large crowds of protesters continued to meet on the streets. After the attack of Abhisit's car at the Interior Ministry after declaring the state of emergency. A large crowd gathered outside the prime minister's office and barricades were constructed in an attempt to block access by the military. At one point protesters gained access to the Interior Ministry, in a confrontation with army units where several warning shots were fired, and they barricaded key road junctions and at least one railway. The anti-government protesters commandeered buses and two armored cars and blocked access to key government offices, some of them made ready by arming themselves with klewang and petrol bombs. According to BBC news, at least two people were killed in the protests and violent scuffles which had already broken out between the army and protestors with several people arrested while the government denied this report.
Thai New Year events.
In a pre-dawn raid on Monday 13 April, Thai soldiers in full combat kit used tear gas and fired live rounds and training rounds from automatic weapons to clear protesters from the Din Daeng intersection near the Victory Monument in central Bangkok, injuring at least 70 people.
On 21 April, Abhisit declared a "media war" against the UDD's claims. He also announced the public distribution of millions of VCDs documenting the government's views on the unrest. At the time, the government's emergency and censorship decrees were still in place.
The state of emergency, but not the censorship decree, was lifted on 24 April.
Abhisit's treatment of the UDD prompted criticisms that he applied one standard for his critics and another standard for his PAD supporters. The Asian Human Rights Commission noted "The obvious differences in how the yellow shirts and red shirts have been treated will only encourage government opponents to resort to increasingly extralegal means to get their way." At the time, warrants had not yet been issued for the PAD's airport seizures that occurred months before, while warrants had been issued for the UDD hours after the military commenced its crackdown.
Deaths, injuries, and damage.
According to government figures, over 120 people were injured in the unrest, most of them UDD demonstrators. At least 1 UDD protester was injured from gunshot wounds sustained during the military's attack in Din Daeng, although the Army claimed the wound was not caused by their standard firearm. The UDD claimed that at least 6 demonstrators were killed in the unrest and their bodies hauled away by the military, although the Army rejected the claim. The dead bodies of 2 UDD protesters were found floating in the Chao Phraya River, their hands tied behind their backs and their bodies badly beaten, although police had yet to conclude whether their murders were politically motivated. Despite the claims, Army chief Anupong Paochinda swore on his life that no lives were lost as a result of his security operations.
Abhisit aide Satit Wongnontaey claimed that two Bangkok residents were shot dead by red shirted protesters in clashes in Din Daeng. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration estimated that it had incurred 10 million Baht (approximately 300,000 USD) in property damages, including 31 damaged and burned buses. Standard & Poor's lowered Thailand's local currency rating to "A-" from "A", although Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij claimed this would increase the government's borrowing cost minimally.
Assassination attempt on Sondhi Limthongkul.
Sondhi Limthongkul, leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy, was shot early in the morning of 17 April 2009. Gunmen firing M-16 and AK-47 rifles shot out his tires at a petrol station and sprayed over 100 bullets into Sondhi’s car, wounding Sondhi and seriously wounding his driver. The attackers escaped the scene when Sondhi's followers in another car opened fire on them. Sondhi suffered one wound to the head but was conscious, standing, and lucid before being sent to the hospital for surgery. Sondhi survived the surgery and was visited by relatives afterwards.
Sondhi's son, Jittanart Limthongkul, blamed factions within the military and the Abhisit government of being behind the assassination attempt:
"A new form of war is emerging – it's being launched by the collusion of certain police and military officers. They are plotting a new coup. It is said that a minister, who is said to be involved in the attempted assassination of a privy councillor, is actively behind this new exercise."
Privy Councillor Charnchai Likitjitta had recently allegedly been the target of an assassination plot. The Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for a close aide to Deputy Prime Minister and senior Chart Thai Pattana Party figure (close coalition partner of the Democrats) Sanan Kachornprasart, on the grounds that the aide masterminded the alleged assassination attempt on privy councillor Charnchai Likitjitta.
However, foreign minister and former PAD leader Kasit Piromya speculated that Thaksin was behind the assassination attempt:
"Thaksin failed on the populist movement and now I think he has resorted to some sort of assassination attempt."
Kasit revealed that he had planned to have lunch with the Sondhi on the day of the attack. Kasit also claimed that himself, Abhisit, Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij, and Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban were planned targets for assassination, and that he was guarded by several fully armed marines.
International reactions.
According to CNN, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that he was disappointed by the delay of the 14th ASEAN Summit, stating that "I understand the circumstances that led the Thai government to take this difficult decision. While I had hoped to have exchanges with the leaders of ASEAN and its dialogue partners, I continue to look forward to engaging again with them in the near future. I strongly value the long-standing relationship between ASEAN and the United Nations, and their cooperation in various fields. I hope for an early restoration of normalcy in Thailand and for the settlement of differences through dialogue and peaceful means."
Human Rights Watch condemned the violence. "Soldiers and police who used force beyond what was needed should not escape investigation and prosecution. The government cannot only prosecute protest leaders or they will make a mockery of Thai law," said the group's Asia director.
Travel advisories.
Following the protests at the summit, a number of countries, including Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Philippines, and Singapore issued new travel advisories for their citizens. As of 27 April 2009, Hong Kong lifted its travel advisory to Thailand.
Money laundering allegations against Thaksin Shinawatra.
Shortly before the April unrest, Privy Councilor General Pichitr Kullavanijaya claimed to the Thai media that former US ambassador to Thailand Ralph Boyce told him that Thaksin had laundered 100 billion baht (US$2.8 billion) through Cayman Island bank accounts and was using the funds to organize the anti-government protests. Thaksin strongly denied the charges and filed a defamation suit against the royal advisor in a Thai court. Ambassador Boyce was reported to have told numerous people that he has no idea why he was cited by Privy Councilor Pichitr, and that he has no such information about the alleged money laundering.
Bhumibol and the 2006 coup.
On 20 April 2009, Thaksin claimed in an interview with the Financial Times that King Bhumibol had been briefed by Privy Councillors Prem Tinsulanonda and Surayud Chulanont about their plans to stage the 2006 coup. He claimed that General Panlop Pinmanee, a leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy, had told him of the briefing.
The Thai embassy in London immediately denied Thaksin's claims. Coup leaders had earlier revealed that they started planning for the coup in approximately February 2006. Former National Security Council head Prasong Soonsiri claimed that he and Sonthi Boonyaratklin had been planning a coup as early as July 2006, but that Surayud and Prem were not yet involved at the time. The King had an audience with Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda at the same time as the First Special Forces were ordered mobilised. The purpose of the audience was reported to concern a meritmaking ceremony for the Queen's late mother. In a 23 April interview with the Financial Times, Abhisit also denied the claims, noting "We checked up on the answer and the meeting referred to did not in any way discuss the coup." Editor Thanong Khanthong of "The Nation" newspaper also denied Thaksin's claim, noting “As a matter of fact, His Majesty did not personally approve the 2006 coup.”
According to Thai political tradition, the king of Thailand always complied with the change of the regime caused by the coup, since the 1932 Revolution.
2010 "red shirt" opposition supporter protests.
In early 2010 a series of events occurred in which the situation escalated. On 26 February, assets worth 46 billion Thai baht were seized from former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. On the evening of 27 February, M67 grenades were thrown from a motorcycle outside three branches of Bangkok Bank. In early March 2010, "red shirt" protesters converged on Bangkok to press demands for Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to call new elections. The movement, led by the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), consists of democracy supporters. Many also supported former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006. Although relatively peaceful in nature, human blood donated by some of the protesters was poured outside Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's home.
The situation escalated further on the weekend of 10 April 2010. First, protesters took control of a TV broadcasting station causing Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to vow to restore Thailand to normalcy. By 11 April, clashes between protesters and the military had resulted in 18 or 19 people (one military) being killed and over 800 injured. By 15 April, the death toll had risen to 24.
Tensions continued to grow, as pro-government rallies started to appear alongside the anti-government ones. On 22 April, a series of explosions in Bangkok killed at least one person and injured more than 85 others, including four foreigners. At least some of the explosions were caused by grenades. The government made allegations these were fired from the Red Shirt encampment, a claim vigorously denied by protest leaders, who suspect it was planned to justify violence against peaceful demonstrators.
On 3 May, the Thai Prime Minister announced he was willing to hold elections on 14 November should the opposition "red shirts" accept the offer. The following day "red shirt" leaders accepted the proposal to leave the occupied parts of Bangkok in return for the new election on the scheduled date, subject to further details of the offer. When it became clear that Abhisit government leaders responsible for unlawful killings of unarmed protesters would be exempt from legal proceedings, the rallies continued.
On 14 May, police and troops attempted to surround and cut off the main protest camp, which resulted in clashes with the red shirts and the deaths of ten people, with a further 125 wounded, including some journalists as well as renegade general Khattiya Sawasdipol who took a sniper's bullet during an interview with foreign press.
By 15 May, the deathtoll had reached 24 with 175 injured. Protest leaders warned that a civil war was increasingly likely. Troops set up live fire zones near the protestors and shot anyone entering these areas on sight.
As of 16 May, the number of people killed in the street battles as a result of the political unrest had risen to 35. Only one of these 35 was from the military. A State of Emergency was declared in five more provinces to prevent more protesters entering Bangkok.
On 19 May, the Army, backed by armoured personnel carriers attacked the protest camp resulting in the deaths of 11 protesters and an Italian journalist. The Red Shirt leaders all either surrendered or tried and escape. Riots raged across Bangkok as Red Shirts were forced from their camp. Arson attacks resulted in the near destruction of the Central World shopping centre and other buildings.
The casualty count as of 22 May stood at 85 dead and 1,378 injured.
Economic effects.
As the crisis is ongoing and fluid, the final economic consequences of the crisis are as yet unclear. After a state of emergency was declared on 2 September 2008, the SET Index reached its lowest point since January 2007 at 655.62; it had fallen 24.7% since the beginning of the PAD’s demonstrations in May 2008. The baht hit a one-year low of 34.52 per US dollar, prompting the Bank of Thailand to intervene.
The PAD seizure of Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi Airports is estimated to have cost the Thai economy at least three billion Baht (approximately US$100 million) a day in lost shipment value and opportunities. As of 1 December 2008, the number of stranded passengers was estimated at anywhere from over 100,000 to 350,000. The April 2009 unrest was reported to have caused nearly 10 million Baht (approximately 300,000 USD) in property damages to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, including 31 damaged and burned buses.
Political effects.
The long term political consequences of the crisis are as yet unclear. The crisis, and particularly the siege of Suvarnabhumi Airport, saw a rise in international press coverage on Thailand, with numerous high-profile articles breaking Thai taboos about public discussion of the role of the monarchy in the crisis as well as the succession. There was a decline in the popularity of the PAD among the Bangkok elite as the crisis escalated and increasingly affected the economy. The crisis saw increasing polarization in Thai political thinking, with David Streckfuss of the Council on International Educational Exchange noting that it "shattered the myth of unity that has been papered over the many social and political cleavages in Thailand." The judiciary was increasingly seen as a tool of the elite, having flagged the government for even the tiniest infractions while refusing to rein in the growing violence of the PAD.
In 2009, there was growing concern about a perceived double standard in how the UDD's protests were treated compared to how the PAD's 2008 protests were treated. Contrasts were drawn between the light touch used by security forces in 2008 against royalist protesters and the thousands of troops who forcibly dislodged the UDD from Bangkok’s streets in 2009. The Abhisit government censored several Internet sites linked to the UDD as well as a satellite television station that carried live broadcasts of the protests. By contrast ASTV, a satellite station run by the PAD, was never shut down. The 2009 protests also saw two distinct camps emerge within the UDD: one camp which openly supports Thaksin and one camp whose primary focus is upon protesting against the Abhisit government and the bureaucratic polity that is perceived to be supporting it.
Protests recommenced in late 2013, as the PAD, led by former minister Suthep Thaugsuban, demanded an end to the so-called Thaksin regime. The PAD protesters called for the establishment of an unelected “people’s council”—in place of Yingluck's government—that will cleanse Thai politics and eradicate the Thaksin regime. In response to the intensive protests, Yinluck dissolved parliament on 9 December 2013 and proposed a new election for 2 February 2014, a date that was later approved by the election commission. The PAD insisted that the prime minister stand down within 24 hours, regardless of her actions, with 160,000 protesters in attendance at Government House on 9 December. Yingluck insisted that she would continue her duties until the scheduled election in February 2014, urging the protesters to accept her proposal: "Now that the government has dissolved parliament, I ask that you stop protesting and that all sides work towards elections. I have backed down to the point where I don't know how to back down any further."

Game notes.
UNLV.
With 18 seconds to play, the Razorbacks grabbed their first win of the year from the UNLV Rebels. Running back Cedric Cobbs ran in from one yard away to give the Hogs a 14–10 win. Arkansas had only 114 total yards, 49 of those coming on the final scoring drive, as Cobbs had 29 yards on 13 carries. Four Razorback QBs played. Lawrence Richardson returned an interception for a touchdown for the other Razorback touchdown. 
Tennessee.
In a game delayed twice due to lightning, in front of a record crowd in the newly expanded Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, the Razorbacks had a 3–0 lead until the fourth quarter, when Tennessee roared back for 13 points and the win. Cedric Cobbs broke the thousand yard milestone with a forty yard dash, setting up the only Razorback points of the contest, a 24-yard Brennan O'Donohoe field goal. The Hogs would gain −3 yards offensively from that point, and Tennessee would not score until a 33-yard field goal with 9:44 to play. An Arkansas punt and seven Volunteer plays later produced another field goal, giving Tennessee a 6–3 lead. Travis Stephens of Tennessee would later spin in from three yards out, producing the first and final touchdown in the final minute. Freshman Stevens would have 206 yards, leading #8 Tennessee to a win.
Alabama.
Alabama scored 21 points from three Arkansas miscues, and defeated the Razorbacks 31–10. A 42-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown by Tide defender Reggie Myles, coupled with a Thurman Ward interception returned for a 60-yard touchdown gave the Tide a win despite being outgained (315–249) and losing the time-of-possession battle (35:28–24:32). 
Ryan Sorahan, who had to leave the game due to a back injury, was 14 of 19 for 139 yards. Zak Clark and later Tarvaris Jackson (who would later transfer to Alabama A&M and later play for the Minnesota Vikings) would spell him. 
Georgia.
Georgia QB David Greene finished two yards short of 300 and RB Musa Smith finished five yards shy of 100 as Georgia handed Arkansas its third straight SEC loss. Back-up Hog QB Zak Clark started the game between the Hedges for the injured Sorahan, and RB Brandon Holmes left the game after spraining his left shoulder.
The Bulldogs opened the scoring with a 2 yard Verron Hayes run, countered by the Hogs with a Holmes TD run. The SEC foes then swapped field goals, before Greene hooked up with Terrence Edwards for a seven-yard TD strike. After another field goal by each squad, Georgia took a 20–13 halftime lead. In the third quarter, Razorback Marvin Jackson returned a punt 74 yards for a touchdown, the first since 1992, but Georgia's Musa Smith responded by diving two yards for a score. After a third Razorback field goal by O'Donohoe, the Dogs put the game away with a four TD pass from Greene.
Weber St..
Lawrence Richardson returned the game's opening kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, and the Hogs never looked back in their 42–19 win against the Wildcats of Weber State. Razorback running back Brandon Holmes added another score from one yard out to make it a 14–0 Hog lead. In the second quarter, George Wilson hauled in a 33 yard strike to push the lead to 21–0. To open the second half scoring, Hog RB Fred Talley sprinted 35 yards to the end zone, and after a Weber State score, Razorback Decori Birmingham added a ten-yard touchdown scamper, making the score 35–7. The Wildcats connected on a 17-yard TD pass, but missed the extra point, making it a 35–13 Arkansas lead. Matt Jones then electrified the homecoming crowd with a 59-yard touchdown run to cap the Arkansas scoring at 42–13. Weber State would add another score with less than a minute remaining, but Arkansas would take a 42–19 final.
South Carolina.

Nicholas Tolstoy (1867, Saint Petersburg, Russia - February 4, 1938) was the first Russian Orthodox priest who solicited a union with Catholic Church in 1893. Father Tolstoy inaugurated a small Catholic community of Russian origin and was responsible by its development and its faithfuls. Father Tolstoy died on February 4, 1938.

In 1890, ordained an Orthodox priest in the following year taking a trip to the Middle East to become familiar with the traditions and customs of the Middle Eastern Christians. After the return of the French abbot Vivian of Saint Louis Church in Moscow he introduced Tolstoy to Dominican Vincenzo Vannutelli, who after talking with Tolstoy told him that with his views, he can consider himself a Catholic, while staying in the home of the Russian Orthodox Church.
Soon Father Nicholas journey around the world taking with him marching corporal and remembering in the cities of following local bishops. In Vienna Nicholas Tolstoy first visited the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and met with Metropolitan Sylvester Sembratovich. After returning to Moscow Tolstoy wrote his thesis on the Eucharist under the leadership of Alexey Lebedev. In 1893 graduated with honors from the Theological Academy, and in November 1894 formally joined the Catholic Church.
Soon Moscow Metropolitan Sergius noted the Catholic view of Nicholas Tolstoy. Nicholas wrote account of their religious views, but the Metropolitan has not given a single stroke. On his Catholic views Nikolai Tolstoy spoke with John Sergiev. In the Synod also knew about the views of Nicholas, but no action taken.
After the funeral of Emperor Alexander III, Tolstoy suddenly summoned to the reception and showed to Procurator of the Holy Synod Vladimir Karlovich Sabler the latest issue of the Catholic journal " Revue Benedictine", which was published by his private letters to Father Vanutelli. Under the threat of repression and confiscation from Tolstoy was demanded renunciation of dignity.

Chidananda Saraswati

Chidananda Saraswati (September 24, 1916 – August 28, 2008) was President of the Divine Life Society, Rishikesh, India. He is well known in India as a yogi, jnani and spiritual leader. He succeeded as President of the Divine Life Society in 1963, after the death of his predecessor, Sivananda Saraswati, who founded the Society.
Chidananda's birth name was Sridhar Rao. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Loyola College, Madras. He took to a life of renunciation in 1936, and joined the Sivananda Ashram run by Sivananda Saraswati in Rishikesh in 1943. 
He was appointed General Secretary of the Divine Life Society in 1948. He was initiated into the Sannyas order by his guru, Sivananda, on Guru Purnima day, July 10, 1949. It was then that he received his monastic name "Chidananda", which means "one who is consciousness and bliss".
He was elected President of the Divine Life Society in August 1963, upon the death of Sivananda.
Chidananda Saraswati died on August 28, 2008, at 20:11 pm.
Early life.
Sridhar Rao, (as Chidananda Saraswati was known before taking Sannyasa (embracing a life of renunciation), was born to Sri Srinivasa Rao and Sarojini, on September 24, 1916, the second of five children and the eldest son. Sri Srinivasa Rao was a prosperous Zamindar (a rich landlord) owning several villages, extensive lands and palatial buildings in South India. Sarojini was an ideal Indian mother, noted for her saintliness.
At the age of eight, Sridhar Rao's life was influenced by Sri Anantayya, a friend of his grandfather, who used to relate to him stories from the epics, Ramayana and Mahābhārata. Doing Tapas (austerities), becoming a Rishi (sage), and having a vision of the Lord became ideals which he cherished.
His uncle, Krishna Rao, shielded him against the influences of the materialistic world around him, and sowed in him the seeds of the "nivritti" life (life of renunciation) which he joyously nurtured until, as later events proved, it blossomed into sainthood.
His elementary education began at Mangalore. In 1932, he joined the Muthiah Chetty School in Madras, where he distinguished himself as a brilliant student. His cheerful personality, exemplary conduct, and extraordinary traits earned for him a distinct place in the hearts of all teachers and students who came into his contact.
In 1936, he was admitted to Loyola College, whose portals admit only the most brilliant of students. In 1938, he emerged with the degree of Bachelor of Arts.
The family was noted for its high code of conduct and this was infused into his life. Charity and service were the glorious ingrained virtues of the members of the family. These virtues found an embodiment in Sridhar Rao. He discovered ways and means of manifesting them. No one who sought his help was sent away without assistance. He gave freely to the needy. 
Service, especially of the sick, often brought out the fact that he had no idea of his own separate existence as an individual. It seemed as if his body clung loosely to his soul. Nor was all this service confined to human beings. Birds and animals claimed his attention as much as, if not more than, human beings. He understood their language of suffering. His service of a sick dog evoked the admiration of his Guru, Sivananda. He would raise his finger in grim admonition when he saw anyone practicing cruelty to dumb animals in his presence. 
Quite early in life, although born in a wealthy family, he shunned the pleasures of the world to devote himself to seclusion and contemplation. In the matter of study, it was the spiritual books which had the most appeal to him, more than college books. Even while he was at college, text-books had to take second place to spiritual books. The works of Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, and Sivananda, took precedence over all others. 
He shared his knowledge with others, so much so that he virtually became the Guru of the household and the neighborhood, to whom he would talk of honesty, love, purity, service and devotion to God. He would exhort them to perform japa of Rama-Nama. While still in his twenties, he began initiating youngsters into this great Rama Taraka Mantra. He was an ardent admirer of Sri Ramakrishna Math at Madras and regularly participated in the Satsangs (association with the wise) there. The call of Swami Vivekananda to renounce resounded within his pure heart. He ever thirsted for the darshan (meeting/s) of Saints and Sadhus (renunciate) visiting the metropolis. 
In June 1936, he disappeared from home. After a vigorous search by his parents, he was found in the secluded Ashram of a holy sage some miles from the sacred mountain shrine Tirupati. He returned home after some persuasion. This temporary separation was but a preparation for the final parting from the world of attachments to family and friends.
Initiation.
The final decision came in 1943. He was already in correspondence with Sivananda Saraswati. He obtained Sivananda's permission to join the Ashram.
On arriving at the Ashram, he naturally took charge of the dispensary. He became the man with the healing hand. The growing reputation of his divine healing hand attracted a rush of patients to the Sivananda Charitable Dispensary. 
Very soon after joining the Ashram, he gave ample evidence of the brilliance of his intellect. He delivered lectures, wrote articles for magazines and gave spiritual instructions to the visitors. When the Yoga-Vedanta Forest University (now known as the Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy) was established in 1948, Sivananda paid him a fitting tribute by appointing him Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Raja Yoga. During his first year he inspired the students with his brilliant exposition of Maharishi Patanjali's Yoga-Sutras.
It was also in the first year of his stay at the Ashram that he wrote his "magnum opus" 'Light Fountain', an immortal biography of his Guru Sivananda. Sivananda once remarked: "Sivananda will pass away, but 'Light Fountain' will live".
In addition to his multifarious activities and intense Sadhana, he founded, under the guidance of Sivananda, the Yoga Museum in 1947, in which the entire philosophy of Vedanta and all the processes of Yoga Sadhana are depicted in the form of pictures and illustrations. 
Towards the end of 1948, Sivananda nominated him as the General Secretary of The Divine Life Society. The great responsibility of the organization fell on his shoulders. From that very moment he spiritualized all his activities by his presence, counsel and wise leadership. He exhorted all to raise their consciousness to the level of the Divine. 
On Guru Purnima day, July 10, 1949, he was initiated into the holy order of Sannyasa by Sivananda. He now became known as Chidananda, a name which connotes : "one who is consciousness and bliss".
In August 1963, after the Mahasamadhi of the Master, he was elected as President of the Divine Life Society. After election, he strove to hold aloft the banner of renunciation, dedicated service, love and spiritual idealism, not only within the set-up of the widespread organization of the Society, but in the hearts of countless seekers throughout the world, who were all too eager to seek his advice, help and guidance.
Chidananda Saraswati has toured the length and breadth of India, Malaysia and South Africa to serve the devotees of the Society.
Again in 1968, Chidananda undertook the Global Tour at the request of numerous disciples and devotees of Sivananda, and visited all countries of the world. Wherever he went, devotees received him cordially, and listened to him with rapt attention.
Chidananda Saraswati, right from the beginning worked and served the cause of Sivananda's mission tirelessly, and to spread his Divine Life message far and wide, not only in Bharatavarsha (India) but also in countries outside. He inspired others through the practice of self-discipline. For example, after completing a thirty-day fast while in Canada, Swami Chidananda arranged for resources to be provided to support the founding of a Sivanada Ashram in Vancouver. He practiced a non-denominational, universal form of yoga. He often led satsang (group chanting) that named and elevated all of the prophets and sages of all of the world religions equally (Lord Jesus, Ahura Mazda, Lord Buddha, etc.).

St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church (Calgary, Alberta)

St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church is an historic Carpenter Gothic style Roman Catholic church building located at 14608 Macleod Trail in the Midnapore neighbourhood in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It was built in 1904 by local crafstmen on land donated by Patrick Glenn, son of John Glenn and a member of one of Calgary's pioneer farm families. Its steep pitched roof and lancet windows are typical of Carpenter Gothic churches. St. Patrick's was served by noted missionary priest Fr. Albert Lacombe until his death in 1916. Because of its architecture, its connection with Fr. Lacombe and its significance in the religious development of southern Alberta, it was designated a Provincial Historic Resource on April 10, 2001.
The church is set back from the east side of Macleod Trail, and is located north of St. Paul's Anglican Church, a Registered Historic Resource built in 1885. On a hill directly east of the churches stands Lacombe Home, a Provincial Historic Resource built in 1910. St. Patrick's congregation moved to a new building in 1983. The original St. Patrick's church was later used by Midlands United Church, St. Paul's Anglican Church, and All Saints (Lutheran) Church - but was soon vacant and fell into disrepair. In 1997 the Diocese sold the land to Memorial Gardens Association (Alberta) Limited, and the entire property is registered as a cemetery.
In late 2010 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calgary reacquired the land and in June 2011 permitted the St. John Chrysostom Russian Orthodox Church to begin rehabilitation of the church and use of it as a place of worship.

In the Beginning (The Moody Blues song)

"In the Beginning" is a 1969 song by the progressive rock band The Moody Blues. Written by drummer Graeme Edge, it was released as the opening track on the album "On the Threshold of a Dream".
"On the Threshold of a Dream" is a concept album about dreams, and "In the Beginning" introduces this theme. The track begins with a high-frequency electronic sound, which appears repeatedly on the album. As it begins, the mellotron provides an ascending orchestral sound, which ends abruptly when the verses begin.
The lyrics are spoken rather than sung, and it is the only Moody Blues spoken track to feature multiple members reciting the lyrics. The first part is recited by Justin Hayward, whose character is trying to figure out the meaning of life, says "I think, I think I am. Therefore, I am, I think." The next part, recited by Graeme Edge, who portrays the antagonist from a computer-dominated world, tries to lure the main character into a world of little human interaction due to technology running every aspect of life. Edge's vocal piece also features the sound of heavy machinery in the background.
Hayward's character then returns, refuting this lifestyle with "I'm more than that! I know I am. At least, I think I must be." The final part, recited by Mike Pinder, who is the inner self of the main character, convinces the main character to "keep on thinking free", which is part of the album's concept. The song ends by fading into the next track "Lovely to See You."

Iorwerth Peate

Iorwerth Peate also known as Cyfeiliog, (27 February 1901 – 19 October 1982) was a Welsh poet and scholar, best known as the founder, along with Cyril Fox, of St Fagans National History Museum. Born in Llanbrynmair, his interest in folk studies and anthropology was kindled when studying at Aberystwyth under professor Herbert John Fleure and writer T. Gwynn Jones.
Inspired by the open-air museums of Scandinavia, Peate had a vision of recreating this style of attraction, but for Welsh life and culture. His initial attempts were challenged by those outside and inside the academic world. The work on the museum commenced in 1946, thanks to the donation of land from the Earl of Plymouth.
Peate published work on the study of folk life in both English and Welsh. He was a pacifist and believed in a monoglot Welsh speaking Wales.

Boža Jovanović

Boža Jovanović was the first drummer of the Serbian rock band Idoli. He was the band member until 1982 and released two singles and one EP with the band.
Biography.
Jovanović was lived in Belgrade in the same apartment building where Vlada Divljan and Zdenko Kolar lived. The three made a deal to start playing. Divljan got a guitar, Kolar bought a bass and Boža Jovanović used a tin barrel as a drum with metal sticks made by Kolar's father. The band was called Faraoni (Pharaohs) since Divljan had a necklace from Egypt, given by his grandmother, with a Tutankhamun medallion. Since there was a popular band from Kopar named Faraoni, the band was renamed to Holipe. The band lasted for a short time.
When Dečaci decided to start playing Divljan called Kolar and Jovanović to join the band. At the time the band was working with Dragan Papić, photographer and journalist, who became the band's creative mediator and who published Dečaci photos in a well known youth magazine "Vidici". Since Kolar and Jovanović wore beards the band was called Dečaci plus Bradonje (The Boys plus The Bearded) and was shortly after renamed to Idoli. 
The band had a rehearsal on March 1, 1980 which was chosen to be the foundation date of the band. On the first rehearsals Idoli wrote their notable hits, first "Retko te viđam sa devojkama" and "Pomoć, pomoć" and then "Maljčiki", "Malena", "Plastika" and other notable new wave anthems. A month later Papić made a deal with "Vidici" to finance the recording of the first single so the band members recorded "Retko te viđam sa devojkama" and "Pomoć, pomoć" as their first single given as present with the April release of the magazine "Vidici". In the meantime Papić made Kolar and Jovanović to shave, but since the two were not as photogenic as the other three members, Papić stopped working with the band. 
The band started performing live, but due to a small repertoire, the appearances lasted for about ten to twenty minutes. In an interview Kolar stated that Jovanović was a man with the best rhythm feeling he had ever played with, but on live appearances he was always tense but managed to do the work.
Since Idoli became well known and Jugoton was asking for new bands of the popular New Wave music, Idoli were offered to record a single with produce Goran Bregović. "Maljčiki" and a new version of "Retko te viđam sa devojkama" became hits on radio stations. The band members also participated the "Paket aranžman" project which made them become one of the most popular acts in Yugoslavia.
Jovanović did not appear on the "Maljčiki" video but appeared on other videos of that period. When the band set for the studio to record the first album, the eyes of the public were set right at them. Photographs from the recording sessions came out in the newspapers and the release was expected to come out. The band managed to record six new tracks which were released on a 12" EP called VIS Idoli. It featured two covers and four Idoli tracks. The EP was sold in 200.000 copies.
After the release of the EP Jovanović left Idoli and his later career and life are unknown.

Holly

Ilex , or holly, is a genus of 400 to 600 species of flowering plants in the family Aquifoliaceae, and the only living genus in that family. The species are evergreen and deciduous trees, shrubs, and climbers from tropics to temperate zones worldwide.
Description.
The genus "Ilex" is widespread throughout the temperate and subtropical regions of the world. It includes species of trees, shrubs, and climbers, with evergreen or deciduous foliage and inconspicuous flowers. Its range was more extended in the Tertiary period and many species are adapted to laurel forest habitat. It occurs from sea level to more than with high mountain species. It is a genus of small, evergreen trees with smooth, glabrous, or pubescent branchlets. The plants are generally slow-growing with some species growing to tall. The type species is the European holly "Ilex aquifolium" described by Linnaeus,
Plants in this genus have simple, alternate glossy leaves, typically with a spiny toothed, or serrated leaf margin. The inconspicuous flower is greenish white, with four petals. They are generally dioecious, with male and female flowers on different plants, although there are exceptions.
The small fruits of "Ilex", although often referred to as berries, are technically drupes. They range in color from red to brown to black, and rarely green or yellow. The "bones" contain up to ten seeds each. Some species produce fruits parthenogenetically, such as the cultivar 'Nellie R. Stevens'. The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves. Hence the cut branches, especially of "I. aquifolium", are widely used in Christmas decoration. The fruits are generally slightly toxic to humans, and can cause vomiting and diarrhea when ingested. However, they are a very important food source for birds and other wildlife, which help disperse the seeds.
Etymology.
"Ilex" in Latin means the holm-oak or evergreen oak ("Quercus ilex"). Despite the Linnaean classification of "Ilex" as holly, as late as the 19th century in Britain, the term "Ilex" was still being applied to the oak as well as the holly – possibly due to the superficial similarity of the leaves. The name "holly" in common speech refers to "Ilex aquifolium", specifically stems with berries used in Christmas decoration. By extension, "holly" is also applied to the whole genus. The origin of the word "holly" is considered a reduced form of Old English "", Middle English "Holin", later "Hollen".
The French word for holly, ', derives from the Old Low Franconian "*hulis" (Middle Dutch "huls"). Both are related to Old High German ', "huls", as are Low German/Low Franconian terms like ' or '. These Germanic words appear to be related to words for holly in Celtic languages, such as Welsh ', Breton ' and Irish "".
Several romance languages use the Latin word "acrifolium" (turned into "aquifolium" in modern time), so Italian ', Occitan ', etc.
History.
The phylogeography of this group provides examples of various speciation mechanisms at work. In this scenario ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining "Ilex" when the Earth mass broke away into Gondwana and Laurasia about 82 million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the groups and beginning a process of change to adapt to new conditions. This mechanism is called allopatric speciation. Over time survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches. This led to reproductive isolation, an example of ecological speciation. In the Pliocene, around five million years ago, the formation of the new orogeny diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus.
The fossil record indicates that the "Ilex" lineage was already widespread prior to the end of the Cretaceous period. Based on the molecular clock the common ancestor of most of the extant species probably appeared during the Eocene, about 50 million years ago, suggesting that older representatives of the genus belong to now extinct branches. The laurel forest covered great areas of the Earth during the Paleogene, when the genus was more prosperous. This type of forest extended during the Neogene, more than 20 million years ago. Most of the last remaining temperate evergreen forests are believed to have disappeared about 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene. Many of the then existing species with the strictest ecological requirements became extinct because they could not cross the barriers imposed by the geography, but others found refuge as a species relict in coastal enclaves, archipelagos, and coastal mountains sufficiently far from the extreme cold and aridity and protected by the oceanic influence.
The genus includes about 400 to 600 species, divided into three subgenera:
Range.
The genus is distributed throughout the world's different climates. Most species make their home in the tropics and subtropics, with a worldwide distribution in temperate zones. The greatest diversity of species is found in the Americas and in Southeast Asia.
"Ilex mucronata", formerly the type species of "Nemopanthus", is native to eastern North America. "Nemopanthus" was treated as a monotypic genus with eight species. of the family Aquifoliaceae, now transferred to "Ilex" on molecular data; it is closely related to "Ilex amelanchier".
In Europe the genus is represented by a single species, the classically named holly "Ilex aquifolium", and in continental Africa by this species and ("Ilex mitis"). "Ilex canariensis", from Macaronesia, and "Ilex aquifolium" arose from a common ancestor in the laurel forests of the Mediterranean. Australia, isolated at an early period, has ("Ilex arnhemensis"). Of 204 species growing in China, 149 species are endemic. A species which stands out for its economic importance in Spanish-speaking countries is "Ilex paraguariensis" or "Yerba mate". Having evolved numerous species that are endemic to islands and small mountain ranges, and being highly useful plants, many hollies are now becoming rare.
Ecology.
Often the tropical species are especially threatened by habitat destruction and overexploitation. At least two species of "Ilex" have become extinct recently, and many others are barely surviving.
They are extremely important food for numerous species of birds, and also are eaten by other wild animals. In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter storms, birds often take refuge in hollies, which provide shelter, protection from predators (by the spiny leaves), and food. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the larva of the Double-striped Pug moth ("Gymnoscelis rufifasciata"). Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on holly include "Bucculatrix ilecella", which feeds exclusively on hollies, and The Engrailed ("Ectropis crepuscularia").
Toxicity.
Holly may contain caffeic acid, caffeoyl derivatives, caffeoylshikimic acid, chlorogenic acid, feruloylquinic acid, quercetin, quinic acid, kaempferol, tannins, rutin, caffeine, and theobromine. 
Holly berries cause vomiting and diarrhea. They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumption by children attracted to the bright red berries. Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children. 
Holly leaves if eaten may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach and intestinal problems.
Holly plants may be toxic to pets and livestock.
Leaves of some holly species are (or were) used by some cultures to make daily tea. Leaves of other species, such as gallberry ("I. glabra") are bitter and emetic. In general little is known about inter-species variation in constituents or toxicity of hollies.
Ornamental use.
Many of the holly species are widely used as ornamental plants in temperate/european gardens and parks, notably:
Moreover, many hundreds of hybrids and cultivars have been developed for garden use, among them the very popular "Highclere holly", "Ilex × altaclerensis" ("I. aquifolium" × "I. perado") and the "blue holly", "Ilex × meserveae" ("I. aquifolium" × "I. rugosa"). Hollies are often used for hedges; the spiny leaves make them difficult to penetrate, and they take well to pruning and shaping.
Culture.
Holly – more specifically the European holly, "Ilex aquifolium" – is commonly referenced at Christmas time. In many western cultures, holly is a traditional Christmas decoration, used especially in wreaths and illustrations, for instance on Christmas cards. Since medieval times the plant has carried a Christian symbolism, as expressed in the well-known carol "The Holly and the Ivy". However, the association of holly with winter celebrations almost certainly pre-dates Christianity. Druids wore holly wreaths on their heads.
In heraldry, holly is used to symbolize truth.
The Norwegian municipality of Stord has a yellow twig of holly in its Coat-of-arms.
In the extremely popular and best-selling Harry Potter novels, holly is used as the wood in the titular character's wand.

Seton River

The Seton River is a tributary of the Fraser River in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The name is relatively new, and encompasses what had formerly been the Seton Portage River or Portage Creek (aka Portage River) and Seton Creek (which shows up on some topos as "Section Creek" due to a mis-read of old hand-written maps).
Course.
The Seton River originates at the foot of Anderson Lake and runs initially for only 3 km to the head of Seton Lake. From the foot of Seton Lake to the Fraser its remaining course is 5 km in length, with much of its flow diverted via the Seton Canal to the Seton Powerhouse (also known because of its location as the Lillooet Powerhouse). The river's course is generally eastward to join the Fraser River at the town of Lillooet. The upper section between the lakes was historically known as the Portage River or Seton Portage River; its flow is augmented by Whitecap Creek, from the northwest midway along its length, and by Spider Creek nearer Seton Lake. The lower section was formerly named Seton Creek and commonly mislabelled on some maps as "Section Creek", apparently a misrendering of the archaic spelling Seaton Creek. Just below the foot of Seton Lake its flow is considerably augmented by the addition of the waters of Cayoosh Creek, the name of which is generally applied to the river below that point by local residents.
Above Anderson Lake, the main watercourse of the Seton drainage is named the Gates River; numerous creeks along Anderson lake contribute substantially to the volume supplied by the Gates; these include McGillivray Creek, Haylmore Creek, and Lost Valley Creek.

The church is medieval, probably dating from the 13th century, however there are two inscribed stones, one built into the lintel of the east window, dated from the 5th century, the second is a rough, pillar stone, inscribed with Roman capitals. These are an unusual formula, used in the 4th century in Italy and Gaul. which indicates much earlier activity, and it has probably been a place of worship from the early 5th century. The parish church of Harlech, which was built in 1840 to replaced that of Llandanwg is also dedicated to Saint Tanwg.
Saint Tanwg is said to have been the son of Ithel the Generous of Armorica. 
According to Enwogion Cymru, Tanwg was 'a saint who lived in the early part of the sixth century. He was one of the sons of Ithel Hael and he accompanied St Cadvan from Armorica to Wales He was a member of the college of Bardsey and he founded the church of Llandanwg in Ardudwy Merionethshire in which parish is situated the town of Harlech.

"Sea Isle City" was struck by an Iranian Silkworm missile launched from the Iranian occupied Al-Faw Peninsula at 05:30 A.M. on October 16, 1987. The missile struck the wheel house and crew quarters of the ship. The ship was not carrying oil at the time it was struck and was moving to be loaded. The ship's master, a US citizen, was blinded and a total of 18 crew members were wounded. "Sea Isle City" was in Kuwaiti waters and was no longer under the protection of US escort ships. "Sea Isle City" was heavily damaged by the missile and it took 4 months to repair the damage to the bridge and crew area. 
The US later undertook Operation Nimble Archer in response to the attack, destroying two oil platforms in the Rostam oil field that were not in production and being used as tactical communication relay points, radar tracking stations and as bases of operations for helicopter and speed boat attacks on maritime shipping in international waters. According to documents seized during the raid on the platform, the Rostam platform's radar had tracked the convoy containing "Sea Isle City" while it was en route to Kuwait and relayed this tactical information via communications gear on the platform.
"Sea Isle City" lookout Victorino Gonzaga, a Philippines national, was also blinded in the attack and treated at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, in Miami, where doctors were forced to remove both of his eyes. Gonzaga and his wife filed suit against Iran, naming Chesapeake Shipping Co., the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co., Kuwait Petroleum Corp. and Gleneagle Ship Management Inc. as co-defendants. The companies named settled out of court for $750,000. 14 months after the suit was filed, a Miami judge found the Government in Tehran liable and awarded $1.2 million to him and $500,000 to his wife. No representatives for Iran ever appeared before the court and at the time it was unclear if he would ever receive the compensation.
Fate.
Some of the reflagged tankers returned to Kuwaiti flags in January 1989, but "Sea Isle City" and several others remained US-flagged. "Sea Isle City" was operated on a Persian Gulf to Indonesia route by Keystone Shipping Company in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). The tanker was listed out of service in May 2002 in the United States Coast Guard database. Its disposition is not known.

Henry Clay Fry

Henry Clay Fry (1840 – 1929) was an American entrepreneur in the glass industry in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.
Biography.
The 1850 United States Federal Census shows that Fry was living with his family in Shelby County, Kentucky.
Fry received his early education in Lexington, Kentucky. Fry at the age of sixteen years found employment as a shipping clerk in the glass manufacturing industry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1860, Fry met Abraham Lincoln while on a sales business trip. It is not known if they discussed the topic of glass. 
In 1862, Fry enlisted in the 15th regiment of the Pennsylvania cavalry. He was in the army until the end of the American Civil War. He then obtained gainful employment at a glass company called Fry, Semple, and Reynolds. 
Fry with others in 1872 formed Rochester Tumbler Company, a glass manufacturing facility. Here in Rochester they built extensive plant building structures on of land they purchased. The company manufactured pressed and blown glass tumblers, being the largest such manufacturer in the nation. They sold these tumblers worldwide. The Rochester Tumbler Company employed over 1200 employees. All the equipment needed in glass production they made themselves on the premises.
In 1897 Rochester Tumbler Company joined National Glass Company of Rochester. Fry became the president of the newly formed corporation. In 1900 he resigned and formed his own company in 1901 called Rochester Glass Company with his sons Harry and J. Howard. In 1902 the company was renamed to H. C. Fry Glass Company. 
With an investment of $500,000, Fry developed and manufactured a new fine cut glass process using pressed blank hot glass techniques. He patented this invention. The glass was pressed into a mold where previously the technique of cut glass had only been blown by hand. The iron plunger pushed into the mold of hot glass and its marks remained on the inside of the glass producing the cut glass effect.
The H. C. Fry Glass Company made complete dinner sets and tea sets. The company also made a large variety of heat-resistant oven glassware from 1916 under a license from the Corning Glass Works.
They also made electrical glass insulators, however few were sold and they are a very rare collector's item. They employed about 1000 people. The plant operated into the 1930s until closure by the receivers. There is a H. C. Fry Glass Society for the study and preservation of glass made at the H. C. Fry Glass Company.

Churchtown Farm

Churchtown Farm is a community nature reserve one mile south of Saltash, Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is owned and managed by Cornwall Wildlife Trust, and includes diverse habitats such as grassland, estuarine mudflats, wetland, woodland, disused quarries and hedgerows.
Situated within the Tamar Valley AONB, and positioned between the rivers Tamar and Lynher as well as Forder Creek, the majority of the reserve is farmland. This includes hay meadows and arable fields. At 61 hectares, it is the third biggest reserve that the Cornwall Wildlife Trust owns.
The land on the reserve is being farmed in a way which reflects traditional Cornish farming, benefiting wildlife in many ways. Historically, Churchtown Farm was farmed for dairy and arable production. From the 1960s, most of the fields were intensively managed, being re-seeded with highly productive rye grass mixtures maintained by regular applications of chemical fertilisers and heavy grazing. This intensive management has artificially increased the soil nutrients and encouraged pastures with a very limited range of plant species and little structural variation. In such a field there is little insect, animal or bird life. In an attempt to encourage wildlife back to the farm, Cornwall Wildlife Trust are using a number of less intensive management techniques aimed at reducing the soil nutrient levels and increasing the number of
plant species.
The two disused quarries in the reserve, Forder and Lowhill, were quarried in the 19th century for roadstone. Lowhill closed in 1915. Horneblende dolerite was quarried for use in road construction. Both quarries are now County Geological Sites. 
Oystercatchers, Dunlins, Egrets, Avocets and Greenshank can all be seen on the mudflats.

The Dimes

The Dimes are an American folk-pop band from Portland, Oregon. While The Dimes have released four EPs under their own, self-titled label, The Dimes), their Album, "The Silent Generation", recorded under the label Pet Marmoset, is considered their debut album. The songs on "The Silent Generation", were largely based on stories singer–songwriter Johnny Clay read in Depression-era newspapers, which guitarist Pierre Kaiser found under the floorboards of his 1908 Portland home. The album was released in December 2007 to positive critical reviews. Their song "Jersey Kid" was featured on NPR: "Second Stage".
The Dimes released their follow-up album, "The King Can Drink the Harbour Dry", on December 1, 2009. The album is based on the stories, people and history of Boston, Massachusetts. The band released a short EP, "New England", in early 2009 which featured some of the songs slated to appear on "The King Can Drink the Harbour Dry".
In mid-2010 The Dimes released an EP "William Dawes and other Forgotten Gems", an EP of B-sides from the King record sessions, which featured some older songs that had long been part of their live show. 
According to lead guitarist Pierre Kaiser, the band was taking much of 2011 to focus on recording and songwriting, targeting a new release in the fall of 2011. "We still plan to play local shows in Portland from time to time during the year, but recording is our focus right now, and frankly it feels wonderful."
The Dimes are the second band of the same name to form in Portland, Oregon, preceding the band composed of Meredith Butner, Steve Gevurtz, Katie Greenhoot, and Liza Stillhard. The Dimes released their self-titled album in 2001 and they also appear on the CD companion to the book "DIY in PDX", as well as a four-song album released in 2002 entitled "Will I?, Won't I?, Do I?, Don't I?".

<doc id="19120269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19120269" title="Methylhexanamine">
Methylhexanamine

Methylhexanamine, commonly known as 1,3-dimethylamylamine or DMAA, was invented and developed by Eli Lilly and Company and was marketed by Lilly as an inhaled nasal decongestant pharmaceutical drug from 1944 until Lilly voluntarily withdrew it from the market in 1983. Methylhexanamine is an indirect sympathomimetic drug.
Since 2006 methylhexanamine has been marketed extensively under many names as an energy-boosting dietary supplement under the claim that is similar to certain compounds found in geraniums, but its safety has been questioned as a number of adverse events and at least 5 deaths have been associated with methylhexanamine-containing supplements. It has been banned by many sport authorities and governmental agencies.
History.
In April 1944, Eli Lilly and Company introduced methylhexanamine under the brand name "Forthane" as an inhaled nasal decongestant; Lilly voluntarily withdrew methylhexanamine from the market in 1983. The compound is an aliphatic amine; the pharmaceutical industry had a strong interest in compounds in this class as nasal decongestants in the early 20th century, which led to DMAA and four other similar compounds being brought to market for that use: tuaminoheptane, octin, oenethyl, and propylhexedrine; octin and oenethyl were eventually approved for use in keeping blood pressure sufficiently high for patients under anesthesia.
Marketing as dietary supplement.
Patrick Arnold reintroduced methylhexanamine in 2006 as a dietary supplement, after the final ban of ephedrine in the United States in 2005. Arnold introduced it under the trademarked name Geranamine, a name held by his company, Proviant Technologies. A large number of supplements focusing on fat loss and workout energy (thermogenic or general-purpose stimulants) now use the ingredient in concert with other substances such as caffeine, a combination similar to the combination of ephedrine and caffeine, which are marketed under trade names such as Floradrene, OxyElite, and Jack3d.
Methylhexanamine-containing supplements sometimes list "geranium oil" or "geranium extract" as a source of methylhexanamine. However, geranium oils do not contain methylhexanamine, and the methylhexanamine in these supplements is added in the form of synthetic material.
Methylhexanamine should not be confused with isoflurane, a general inhalation anaesthetic that is marketed in Australia as "Forthane".
Chemical synthesis.
Methylhexanamine is synthesized by reacting 4-methylhexanone-2 with hydroxylamine, which converts the 4-methylhexanone-2 to 4-methylhexanone-2 oxime, which is reduced with hydrogen by means of a catalyst; the resulting methylhexanamine can be purified by distillation.
Pharmacology.
Methylhexanamine is an indirect sympathomimetic drug that constricts blood vessels and thus has effects on the heart; it also causes bronchodilation, inhibits peristalsis in the intestines, and has diuretic effects. Most studies have been done on pharmacological effects when the drug is inhaled; our understanding of what methylhexanamine does when taken orally are mostly based on extrapolating from the activities of similar compounds. A 2013 review concluded that: "Pharmacological effects after oral intake can be expected on the lungs (bronchodilation) and the nasal mucosa following a single oral dose of about 4–15 mg. Pharmacological effects on the heart can be expected following a single oral dose of about 50–75 mg. Pharmacological effects on the blood pressure can be expected after a single oral dose of about 100 mg. Because of the long half-life, there is a risk that repeated doses within 24–36 hours could lead to steadily stronger pharmacological effects (build up)."
Safety.
The for methylhexanamine is 39 mg/kg in mice and 72.5 mg/kg in rats, when administered intravenously.
The FDA has stated that methylhexanamine "is known to narrow the blood vessels and arteries, which can elevate blood pressure and may lead to cardiovascular events ranging from shortness of breath and tightening in the chest to heart attack." Numerous adverse events and at least 5 deaths have been reported in association with methylhexanamine-containing dietary supplements.
A 2012 review by a panel convened by the U.S. Department of Defense to study whether the military should ban methylhexanamine supplements from stores on its bases concluded that: "The existing evidence does not conclusively establish that DMAA-containing substances are causally-associated with adverse medical events. However, a consistent theme among the studies is that DMAA use potentially affects cardiovascular 
function, just as other sympathomimetic stimulants. Without further rigorous study designs developed to evaluate the safety of DMAA, especially in patients with concomitant use of other substances, co-morbid conditions and high frequency use, the magnitude of the association of DMAA with adverse medical events is uncertain. Widespread use of DMAA-containing products by tens of thousands of Service members – often in combination with other substances – increases the likelihood of observing serious adverse events, even if the overall risk of a DMAA-related event is low, resulting in consequential impact to some Service members and other beneficiaries. DMAA should be further studied to evaluate its safety. Data from the case control study suggest that the frequency and amount of DMAA use and risk of specific AMEs, particularly heat injuries and rhabdomyolysis, need to be examined in greater detail. ... The Safety Review Panel recommended ... to continue the prohibition of sales of DMAA-containing products in Exchanges and concessions. The Panel judged that the evidence supports sufficient risk, even if very low, of another death or catastrophic illness of a Service member who has used DMAA-containing products, without any offsetting benefit of these products."
A 2012 review of the regulatory status of DMAA found that "1,3-Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) is a pressor amine often found in food supplements for athletes at dosages of 25-65 mg. Historically, the compound has been used as a nasal decongestant but its oral application is largely unstudied leaving the regulatory status of such food supplements as unlicensed medicines undetermined. We therefore reviewed the literature on DMAA and similar amines in order to deduce an effective oral dosage. Based on our findings we conclude that oral preparations with >4 mg DMAA per dose unit should be considered as effective as a bronchodilator. Food supplements that exceed that limit are in fact subject to the Medicines Act and require licensing. Dosages higher than 100-200 mg are expected to cause serious adverse events."
Deaths and injuries.
There are published reports of recommended doses of methylhexanamine followed by stroke or death.
In 2010 a 21-year-old male in New Zealand presented with a cerebral hemorrhage after ingesting 556 mg of methylhexanamine, caffeine, and alcohol. Health authorities in Hawaii linked cases of liver failure and one death to OxyElite Pro.
In 2010 two U.S soldiers suffered fatal heart attacks during training in 2010. Methylhexanamine was found in their blood, but after an investigation the army later found that DMAA did not contribute to their death.
The death of Claire Squires, a runner who collapsed near the finish line of the April 2012 London Marathon, has been linked to methylhexanamine. The Coroner stated that methylhexanamine was "probably an important factor" during the inquest. Despite having according to a friend been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat - and advised not to consume methylhexanamine, it is believed that she consumed the substance through drinking an energy drink, which was subsequently adjusted to exclude methylhexanamine.
Regulation.
A number of sporting authorities and countries have banned or heavily restricted the use of methylhexanamine as a dietary supplement, due to serious concerns about its safety. These countries include the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.
Sports authorities.
Many professional and amateur sports bodies, such as the World Anti Doping Agency, have banned methylhexanamine as a performance-enhancing substance and suspended athletes that have used it.
Governmental agencies.
In 2010 the US military issued a recall of all methylhexanamine-containing products from all military exchange stores worldwide.
In July 2011, Health Canada decided methylhexanamine was not a dietary substance, but was a drug requiring further approval. Consequently, Health Canada banned all sales of methylhexanamine. In April 2012, New Zealand formally banned methylhexanamine, citing its use in "party pills". In June 2012, the National Food Agency of Sweden issued a general warning regarding use of methylhexanamine products, resulting in a sales ban in parts of the country.
In July 2012, the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) of Brazil issued a warning to the general public on the hazards of products that contain methylhexanamine. It also updated the list of prohibited substances to insert methylhexanamine, which translates into the banishment of products containing such ingredient from the Brazilian market.
In 2012, Australia banned methylhexanamine. In New South Wales, methylhexanamine was classed as a "highly dangerous substance" on the poisons list. In August 2012, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has ruled that the popular DMAA containing sports supplement Jack3D is an unlicensed medicinal product and that it and all other methylhexanamine containing products need to be removed from the UK market amid concerns of potential risks to public safety.
In 2012 the NZ Ministry of Health banned the sale of methylhexanamine products, due in part to its growing recreational use as party pills.
In April 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that methylhexanamine was potentially dangerous and did not qualify as a legal dietary supplement; it warned supplement makers that it was illegal to market methylhexanamine and warned consumers of potentially serious health risks associated with methylhexanamine-containing products. The FDA has issued warning letters to manufacturers and distributors who continued to market products containing methylhexanamine.

Lucky's Lake Swim

Founded in 1989, Lucky’s Lake Swim is a daily 1 kilometer open water hosted started by Lucky Meisenheimer at his home in Orlando, Florida. The no charge swim has achieved a cult status amongst open water swimmers and triathletes. Thousands have completed the swim. It is originally known as the Aquatica (unrelated to the Orlando water park) 1K enter the food chain swim. The swim is listed by the World Open Water Swimming Association as one of the top 100 open water swims in America.
History.
The swim began in 1989 when Lucky Meisenheimer invited friends and masters swimmers he coached at the YMCA Aquatic Center to join him on his morning lake swim.. Initially the swim was held on Saturdays but after the first year went to 4 days a week. In 1995, it became a daily swim except for Sundays. Originally, the swim went from April through October, in 2005 the swim went year round. The weekday swims, which are always at 6:30 AM, are started in the dark much of the year. On Saturdays and holidays the swims are at 7:45 AM. The starts are a mass start and no other start times are available. In 2013 timed records began to be recorded for all age groups. The current fastest crossing is 12 mins 58 secs by John Meisenheimer, VII. 9
The Wall of Fame.
In 1999, swimmers began signing their names to a wall on the back of the Meisenhiemer’s house on the first completion of the 1-kilometer course. Lucky would write one item of sporting accomplishment under the name if one existed. There is now an eclectic mix of accomplishments listed on the wall some that include; Olympic Swimmers, Olympic Water Polo, National Swimming Champions from multiple countries, World Record holders, National Parachuting Champion, Hang Gliding world record holder, National Sailing Champion, National Unicycle Champion, and scores of Ironman distance finishers. In 2004, Disney artist Ron McDonald added a swimming mural to the wall. In 2008, the wall had to be expanded to allow for more names.
Risks.
The swim is done at a person's own risk. There are no lifeguards or rescue boats. Participants are expected to be accomplished swimmers: others are told not to swim. Swimmers are encouraged to use a flotation aid such as a pull buoy or wetsuit. Alligators have been seen in the lake at times and some swimmers do swim with knives, but there has never been an alligator attack. Reportedly, a lake cane monster lives in the lake. Although, never photographed, residents and swimmers have reported sightings or feeling the monster brush up against them.
Rewards.
On completion of a swimmer's first swim, they receive a patch with the logo of the swim, a bumper sticker , and get to sign the wall of fame. On the twenty-fifth crossing swimmers receive a white racing cap with the logo. On the one hundredth crossing, swimmers are inducted into the 100K club, their name is highlighted in yellow on the wall of fame, and they receive a baseball cap with the logo.
At 150 crossings, swimmers receive a yellow racing cap, 200 crossings a T-shirt, 500 crossings a silver racing cap , and 1000 crossing a gold racing cap and medallion.

Azerbaijani presidential election, 1992

Presidential elections were held in Azerbaijan on 7 June 1992, the first in more than seventy years not held under communist control. Five candidates were on the ballot, seeking election to a five-year term. The election featured the unprecedented use of television, posters, and other media by multiple candidates to communicate platforms and solicit votes. 
The candidates included APF leader Abulfaz Elchibey, former parliament speaker Yaqub Mamedov, Movement for Democratic Reforms leader and Minister of Justice Ilyas Ismayilov, National Democratic Group leader Rafig Abdullayev, and Union of Democratic Intelligentsia candidate Nizami Suleymanov. Two other candidates, from the NIP and the APF, withdrew from the race during the campaign. To register, each candidate had to collect at least 20,000 signatures and present them to the Central Electoral Commission. Aliyev was unable to run because of a constitutional provision barring candidates over sixty-five years of age. The government agreed to allow international observers to monitor the election. Etibar Mammadov, Elchibey's main rival in the polls, dropped out of the race a few days before the election, calling for rule by a coalition government and the postponement of balloting until Azerbaijan's state of war with Armenia ended. 
Elchibey's election as president signaled a break in communist party dominance of Azerbaijani politics. He received 60.9% of more than three million votes cast. The runner-up, Suleimanov, made a surprise showing of 34% of the vote by promising Azerbaijanis instant wealth and victory in Nagorno-Karabakh. No other candidate garnered as much as five per cent of the vote.
Elchibey had been a student of Arabic philology, a translator, and a college instructor. In 1975 the KGB imprisoned him for two years for anti-Soviet activities. In a postelection address to the nation, he announced a stabilization phase based on the transfer of power to his democratic faction. When that phase ended in 1993, constitutional, economic, and cultural reforms would be implemented, according to this plan. His top domestic policy priorities, creation of a national army and a national currency backed by gold reserves, were seen as necessary elements for national sovereignty. Despite the new president's intentions, the war in Nagorno-Karabakh dominated politics, and Elchibey and his party steadily lost influence and popular appeal because of continual military losses, a worsening economy, political stalemate, and government corruption.

Louis Phillips

Louis Phillips (April 22, 1829 – March 16, 1900) was a wealthy land owner and rancher in Los Angeles County, California.
Biography.
Louis Phillips was born in Prussia and moved to California in the early 1850s. He moved to Spadra (now part of Pomona) in 1862 and began engaging in sheep herding and cattle raising. In 1864, Schlesinger and Tischler acquired the Rancho San Jose in a foreclosure. Phillips, who had previously been a manager on the ranch, bought out of the foreclosure.
In January 1874, the Southern Pacific Railroad completed a rail line from Los Angeles to Spadra, spurring interest in land development in the area. In 1875, Phillips built the Phillips Mansion (now operated by the Historical Society of Pomona Valley) and also sold most of his for subdivision into the Pomona Tract, thus beginning the formation of Pomona. Phillips retained surrounding his mansion, which he operated as a cattle and sheep ranch.
In 1867, Phillips married Esther Blake, with whom he had three sons (Charles, George and Louis, Jr.) and two daughters (Mrs. Frank George and adopted daughter, Kate Cecil). He also acquired large land holdings in other parts of the county, including the Los Angeles business district where he owned the Phillips Block on Spring Street, a block on Los Angeles Street and another on Third Street. By 1892, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that Phillips, "who lives so quietly out at Spadra, near Pomona," was "the richest man in Los Angeles County." The "Times" noted that Phillips was worth "not a dollar less than $3,000,000" and stated that, in addition to his land holdings in Los Angeles, he had a ranch that produced wool, honey and wheat. 
He died of pneumonia in 1900 and is interred at Spadra Cemetery, Pomona.

Drayton, Cherwell

Drayton is a village and civil parish in the valley of the Sor Brook in Oxfordshire, about northwest of Banbury.
Early history.
Tesselated tiles and Roman coins found near the parish church indicate that there was a Roman villa in the area of what later became Drayton village.
Drayton village is Saxon in origin. Its toponym comes from the Old English "drag" meaning to carry goods.
Manor of Drayton.
After the Norman conquest of England of 1066 the conquering Normans dispossessed many Saxon landowners, but the Domesday Book records that in 1086 Drayton still belonged to a Saxon thegn, Turchil of Arden. However, in 1088 William the Conqueror created the Earldom of Warwick and thereafter gave Turchil's estates to the Norman nobleman Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick. The Arden family seems to have remained as tenants of the Earldom, for in 1204 a Thomas Arden held the tenancy. In 1329 Sir Robert Arden was licenced to crenellate Drayton manor house. The male line of the Arden family ended in 1376 with the death of Sir Giles Arden, whose son had predeceased him. Sir Giles' granddaughters Margaret and Joan were minors, but on reaching their majority and marriage they inherited the Drayton estate. Joan and her husband surrendered their share of Drayton to Margaret who had married Lewis Greville. The house remained the seat of the Greville family until 1565, when a later Lewis Greville was heavily in debt and sold the manor to one Thomas Webb. By 1588 Thomas Webb had died leaving Drayton to his brother Richard and widow Katherine. Lewis Greville lured Richard Webb to Sezincote House in Gloucestershire where Greville got Webb drunk, persuaded him to write a will in Greville's favour and then murdered him. Greville was tried for murder, and because he refused to enter a plea he was executed by pressing instead of hanging.
By 1598 most of the manor of Drayton belonged to Anthony Cope of Hanwell. In 1611 Elizabeth I made Cope Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet. Drayton remained with the Cope Baronets of Hanwell until the death of Sir John Cope, 5th Baronet in 1721. It then passed to another branch of the Cope family, Sir Jonathan Cope, 1st Baronet of Bruern. When Sir Charles Cope, 3rd Baronet died in 1781, Drayton passed to one of his sisters, Catherine. In 1790 Catherine's daughter Arabella was married to John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and received Drayton from her mother. In 1825 Drayton was inherited by the Duke and Duchess's younger daughter, Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr. When she died in 1870 her manorial rights passed to the North family of Wroxton Abbey.
In about 1629 Sir William Cope, 2nd Baronet sold a large acreage of land at Drayton to 
William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele of Broughton Castle. By 1790 the same property belonged to Francis North, 1st Earl of Guilford of Wroxton Abbey. In 1935 and 1942 the Norths sold their lands at Drayton to Trinity College, Oxford.
Parish church.
The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was in existence by 1223. Its earliest surviving features are a Norman priest's doorway and the font. In the 14th century St. Peter's was almost completely rebuilt and north and south aisles were added, all in the Decorated Gothic style. Lobel and Crossley contend that the clerestorey was added at the same time, but it is in the Perpendicular Gothic style and Sherwood and Pevsner contend it was added later. The low west tower was added in 1808 and has three 17th century bells: two cast in 1634 and two more cast in 1670. In 1878 the Gothic Revival architect Edwin Dolby restored the church and added a vestry.
Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet (1550–1615) was a puritan, and in 1598 he presented Robert Cleaver, a presbyterian to be curate of Drayton. John Bridges, whom James I had appointed Bishop of Oxford in 1603, suspended Cleaver for failing to adhere to the Book of Common Prayer. In 1607 Sir Anthony Cope persuaded Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury to accept Henry Scudder as Drayton's new curate. In 1619 Scudder was succeeded by another puritan, Thomas Lodge, who was described as a ""a burning and a shining light"" and was curate until 1651. A low church tradition survived in Drayton with John Dover, who was curate 1688-1725. From 1778 until the 1960s all of Drayton's curates were Evangelicals and most had served as missionaries in other continents.
St. Peter's is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone Benefice.
Social and economic history.
The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Drayton had a water mill, presumably on Sor Brook on the western boundary of the parish just below the village. There is then a gap of five centuries in which no mill is recorded, but records resume with a mill operating in the parish from 1589 until 1851.
A parsonage was built in Drayton in the 16th century. In 1862 it was replaced by a large new rectory built on the same site by the architect Arthur Blomfield, but the Victorian house retains cellars built in the 17th century.
The main road between Banbury and Warwick runs north-south along a ridge in the eastern part of the parish. It was made into a turnpike in 1744 and ceased to be one in 1871. In the 1920s it was classified as part of the A41 road. After the completion of the M40 motorway in 1990 this part of the A41 was "detrunked" and reclassified as the B4100.
The main road between Banbury and Stratford-upon-Avon branches off the Banbury - Warwick road and descends through Drayton village to cross Sor Brook. An Act of Parliament to turn this road was passed in 1747 works to improve the road and establish toll houses were not undertaken until 1754. Since the 1920s it has been classified the A422 road.
Drayton's earliest recorded public houses were licenced from 1753. By 1782 the village had two pubs, the Hare and Hounds and the Roebuck Inn. The last record of the Hare and Hounds is from 1806, but the Roebuck Inn continues to serve the village. It is a 17th-century Hornton Stone building with a thatched roof. It belongs to the local Hook Norton Brewery and serves real ales.
Thomas Webb had enclosed some of Drayton's farmland when he bought the manor from Lewis Greville in 1565, but the villagers farmed most of the parish on an open field system until it was enclosed in 1802.
By 1833 Drayton had two day schools and a Sunday school. One of the day schools was still extant in 1855, when the 5th Earl De La Warr and Countess De La Warr had given two cottages to be converted into a schoolroom. This was rebuilt by 1891 but was still unsatisfactory and in 1900 a separate infants' classroom was built. The number of pupils declined in the 1930s and the school was closed in 1948.
The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway was built during the First World War to carry ironstone from a quarry west of Horley to a junction with the Great Western Railway just north of Banbury. The ironstone railway passed just north of Drayton. It was opened in 1917 and closed in 1967.
North Oxfordshire Academy.
North Oxfordshire Academy is a county secondary school just outside the village. It was founded in 2007 to take over the premises of the former Drayton School, which had been opened in 1973.

2007 Gumball 3000 collision

The Gumball 3000 Rally of 2007 ended early as the result a traffic accident on May 2, 2007, in which two people were killed. The accident involved the TechArt Porsche 997 Turbo of Nick Morley and Matthew McConville and the Volkswagen Golf of Vladimir and Margarita Chepunjoski. The accident resulted in the immediate death of Mr. Chepunjoski, while his wife died two days later as a result of the injuries from the crash.
Gumball 3000.
The Gumball 3000 is an annual 3000 mile (5000 km) international rally which takes place on public roads, which travels around the world. Although set up as a rally with no official timing, or prizes for reaching check points first, during the rally, some participants have been fined for speeding and other traffic offences by the police in countries they passed through, cars have been confiscated and the 2007 rally was canceled after a car participating in the rally was involved in a fatal collision with a non-participating vehicle. Although the organizers are careful to emphasize that it is a rally and not a race, it is sometimes referred to as a streetrace.
The collision.
On May 2, the participants in the 2007 Rally were driving through the Republic of Macedonia on a route from the Macedonian-Greek border near Bitola to the border with Albania, near the town of Struga. The traffic accident occurred on the motorway M4, at the entrance of the town of Struga, about from the Macedonian-Albanian border post. The coordinates of the exact location of the crash are .
The Porsche 911 Turbo hit an oncoming Volkswagen Golf, which was making a left turn on to the main road from a side road and driving in the opposite direction of the Porsche. The Porsche hit the Golf head-on, and the crash pushed both vehicles off the road.
A video of the immediate aftermath was subsequently posted to the YouTube website.
Both the driver and the passenger in the Golf were heavily injured. The driver and the passenger of the Porsche seemed virtually unharmed, and they were immediately picked up by another Gumball 3000 participating vehicle, a BMW M6, and it is alleged they then fled to the border, where they were arrested by the Macedonian border police. The casualties reported in the accident were the 67-year old driver of the Golf, Vladimir Chepunjoski, who died on his way to the hospital, and his wife Margarita Chepunjoski, who died in hospital from injuries sustained in the crash on May 4.
Nicholas Morley was set free on bail of £17,000 and ordered to appear in court for a trial; however, he tried to flee the country once again the next day in Skopje, while trying to board a private jet. After this second arrest, he was detained in prison until the trial.
The trial.
In court the prosecution alleged a speed of 161 km/h (100 mph) while the defense opposed this by saying that the speed of the incoming vehicle was not taken into account and that Morley's driving speed was only 70–75 km/h.
The subsequent court hearing found Morley guilty and convicted of "endangering traffic, leading to death" and was released from custody after receiving a two-years suspended sentence for those two deaths.
After the verdict Morley's family released a statement detailing its own expert's findings, which contradict those of the prosecution's expert. The statement also claims that the defence were denied the opportunity to present their expert's findings, which could contravene article 6 of the European convention on human rights, the right to a fair trial. Despite this, an appeal was not made in due term.
Aftermath.
The organisers of the Gumball 3000 initially continued the rally despite the incident, in a later official statement the organisers stated that the clear details of the incident and confirmation of a fatality did not occur until some hours after the briefing, at which point the decision to cancel the remainder of the rally was made. Adidas, a sponsor to the 2007 Gumball 3000, immediately backed out as a rally sponsor and took all Gumball 3000 related merchandise off the market internationally.

X-shaped radio galaxy

X-shaped (or "winged") radio galaxies are a class of extragalactic radio source that exhibit two, low-surface-brightness radio lobes (the "wings") oriented at an angle to the active, or high-surface-brightness, lobes. Both sets of lobes pass symmetrically through the center of the elliptical galaxy that is the source of the lobes, giving the radio galaxy an X-shaped morphology as seen on radio maps (see figure).
X-shaped sources were first described by J. P. Leahy and P. Parma in 1992, who presented a list of 11 such objects. The X-shaped galaxies have received much attention following the suggestion in 2002 that they might be the sites of spin-flips associated with the recent coalescence of two supermassive black holes.
Properties.
X-shaped galaxies are a sub-class of Fanaroff-Riley Type II (FRII) radio galaxies. FRII objects exhibit a pair of large (kiloparsec) scale radio lobes that straddle the parent elliptical galaxy; the lobes are believed to consist of plasma ejected from the center of the galaxy by jets associated with the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole. Unlike the classical FRII sources, the X-shaped galaxies exhibit "two", misaligned pairs of radio lobes of comparable extent. One pair of lobes, the "active" lobes, have a relatively high surface brightness and appear to be generated by ongoing emission from the center of the galaxy. The second set, the "wings", have a lower surface brightness, and appear to consist of plasma that was ejected along a different axis than that associated with the active lobes. The wings are also observed to have a higher spectral index than the active lobes and are highly polarized. With one exception, none of the X-shaped sources shows the broad, optical emission lines associated with quasar activity. The host galaxies mostly exhibit high ellipticities and a number have nearby companion galaxies.
Origin.
In their original catalog of 11 X-shaped galaxies, Leahy and Parma proposed that the "wings were created in an earlier outburst, some tens of Myrs previous to the current renewal of nuclear activity, during which time the ejection axis has precessed." They noted that their proposal was consistent with the low surface brightness, steep radio spectrum, and high polarization of the wings, all of which are features associated with old (inactive) radio sources.
A widely discussed model for the origin of the X-shaped sources invokes a spin-flip of the supermassive black hole. In this model, a galaxy merger causes a second, smaller supermassive black hole to be deposited near the center of the original radio galaxy. The smaller black hole forms a binary system with the larger black hole before the two coalesce via the emission of gravitational waves. During the coalescence, the spin axis of the larger hole undergoes a sudden reorientation due to absorption of the smaller hole's orbital angular momentum—a "spin-flip." Since the lobes are produced by jets that are launched perpendicularly to the inner accretion disk, and since the accretion disk is constrained by the Bardeen-Petterson effect to lie perpendicular to the black hole's spin axis, a change in the spin orientation implies a change in the direction of the lobes.
Even a rather small infalling black hole, with a mass approximately one-fifth that of the larger hole, could cause the spin of the latter to change by ninety degrees.
Alternative models to explain the X-shaped sources include a warping instability of the accretion disk; backflow of gas along the active lobes and binary-disk interactions before coalescence. It is likely that all of these mechanisms are active at some level and that the time scale for realignment influences the radio source morphology, with the most rapid realignments producing the X-shaped sources, while slower realignment would cause the jet to deposit its energy into a larger volume, leading to an S-shaped FRI radio source.

USS Vigil (AGR-12)

USS "Vigil" (AGR-12/YAGR-12) was a "Guardian"-class radar picket ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1956 from the "mothballed" reserve fleet. She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Atlantic Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line.
Liberty ship built in Florida.
"SS Raymond Van Brogan" was laid down under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 2339) on 14 December 1944 at the Wainwright yard of the J. A. Jones Construction Co. in Panama City, Florida; launched on 27 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Anne Durham; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 10 February 1945.
World War II services.
Following a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, the ship transited the Panama Canal on 19 February and headed for Terminal Island, California, where she was turned over to A. J. Bull & Co. for operation under contract to the War Shipping Administration. 
She performed several resupply missions in the Pacific Ocean theater, carrying aircraft as well as other materiel and some troops. 
Following the end of World War II, the War Shipping Administration transferred her contract to the Waterman Steamship Corporation, which firm operated her from Mobile, Alabama. In the summer of 1947, "SS Raymond Van Brogan" was taken out of service and berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Mobile, Alabama.
Conversion to radar picket.
Nine years later, in June 1956, she was brought out of the U.S. Maritime Commission's reserve fleet for conversion to a radar picket ship and active service with the Navy. She was moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she completed her conversion at the naval shipyard. 
On 7 August 1956, she received a new name and her Navy hull designation to become "Vigil" (YAGR-12). She completed conversion early in 1957 and was placed in service on 5 March 1957, Lt. Comdr. Stanley Abstetar, USNR, in command.
During "Vigil's" eight-year naval career, she was assigned to the Continental Air Defense Command and served as one of that organization's radar picket ships operating as seaward extensions of its radar coverage system. The ship operated out of Davisville, Rhode Island, during her entire period of service and spent on the average of 200 days per year actually engaged in picket patrols in waters off the coast of New England. 
On 28 September 1958, she was redesignated "AGR-12", thereby dropping her yard craft designation and becoming a commissioned auxiliary.
Decommissioning.
On 3 March 1965, "Vigil" was placed out of commission. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1965, and she was returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission for lay up with the Hudson River Group of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. On 23 November 1970, she was sold to the Spanish firm, "Revalorizacion de Materiales", for scrapping.
Honors and awards.
"Vigil" personnel qualified for the following medals:

Magomed Yevloyev

Magomed Yakhyаvich Yevloyev (Магомед Яхьявич Евлоев) (1971 – 31 August 2008) was an Ingush journalist, lawyer, and businessman, and the owner of the news website Ingushetiya.ru, known for being highly critical of Murat Zyazikov, the President of Ingushetia, a federal subject of Russia locating in the North Caucasus region. Magomed Yevloyev is not to be confused with the Ingush rebel leader Akhmed Yevloyev, who is also known as Magomed, or with the 20-year-old also named Magomed Yevloyev who is suspected of being a suicide bomber in the Domodedovo International Airport bombing.
Early life and education.
Magomed Yevloyev was born in the town of Malgobek, Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (now in the Republic of Ingushetia, Russia) in 1971. In 1992, Yevloyev graduated from Saratov Law Institute (Саратовский Юридический Игститут).
Career.
After graduation, Yevloyev began to work as a public procurator in Ingushetia. He soon became the Deputy Chief Procurator of Malgobek. In 1999, he was accused of complicity in the murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev, who was at that time imprisoned as a kidnapper. Allegedly Yevloyev had signed the permit allowing the murderers to take Tsechoyev from his cell. The accusations were not proven but Yevloyev resigned from his post as a prosecutor.
In 2001, Yevloyev founded the Moscow legal firm Infra-Yur. In 2008, the firm became Infra Holding, a company which oversaw construction, fishing, legal firms, and security bureaus. It also controlled Infra North America, a daughter firm operating in the USA. Yevloyev was the president of this holding.
Also in 2001, Yevloyev created the website "Ingushetia.ru". Originally there was no intention to make an opposition website; Yevloyev planned to host a neutral collection of materials on the history and culture of the Ingush people, without favoring any particular point of view. But he soon found that historical and cultural materials often included explosive political content as well, and the site became a source of political materials, such as information on the Second Chechen War, counter-terrorist operations, the Ossetian–Ingush conflict, and kidnappings and murders in Ingushetia. Many of these materials were highly critical of Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov and his government.
In July 2007, the public procurator of Moscow's Kuntsevo municipality initiated a criminal case accusing Yevloyev of "inciting inter-ethnic hatred", though in the end Yevloyev was never indicted for any criminal activities. In October 2007, the Tsechoyev murder case was reopened and Yevloyev's family house in Malgobek was searched. After the search, Yevloyev's father, Yakhyu Yevloyev, convinced his son to publicly sever all ties with the Ingushetia.ru site, as it appeared to be too dangerous. Since then, the site has been controlled by an editorial committee chaired by Ibragim Kostoyev.
Yevloyev did not, however, completely withdraw from the politics of Ingushetia. He was one of the organizers of the "I did not vote" campaign, intended to expose mass voter fraud in Ingushetia during the 2008 Russian presidential election. According to official data, 98% of eligible Ingushetia voters took part in the elections, almost all voting for Dmitry Medvedev. But Yevloyev alleged that less than half of registered voters had actually participated in the elections, and therefore sought to compile a list of people who could personally guarantee that they did not vote in the election. If the list proved to include more than 2% of Ingushetia's voting registry, it might constitute proof of massive election fraud.
Yevloyev also organized and financed a campaign collecting signatures calling for the removal of Ingushetia President Zyazikov, and the restoration of the previous Ingushetia president Ruslan Aushev.
In the beginning of 2008, the office of the Ingushetia public procurator initiated hearings in Kuntsevo Court, demanding that access to the site Ingushetia.ru be restricted. According to the prosecutors, in an interview with Ingushetia businessman Musa Keligov hosted on the site, Keligov directly accused Zyazikov of connections with guerillas. The prosecutors argued that this material constituted libel as well as "public advocacy of extremist activity". In May 2008, the court issued an injunction demanding that Russian providers "limit access to the site by filtering its IP addresses". In June 2008, the court characterized the site as "extremist" and demanded its closure. The site was not closed. According to Ingushetia.ru's lawyer Kaloy Akhilgov, since the site is registered in the United States, it is therefore outside the jurisdiction of Russian courts. Akhilgov also stated that the decision is technically incorrect because it classifies the site under the heading "mass media" despite the fact that the site is not officially registered as such. Akhilgov added that they intended to appeal the court decision.
Death.
On 31 August 2008, Magomed Yevloyev was shot in the temple and killed while in police custody. Weeks before his killing, it was rumoured that Magomed knew his life was in danger and he had planned on seeking political asylum in a European Union country. Local police claimed that Yevloyev was shot after he had attempted to grab an assault rifle from one of the police officers in the car. Human rights groups have rejected this account of Yevloyev's death, and the United States State Department has called for an investigation of the killing and for those responsible to be "held to account for what happened". A spokesman for Vladimir Putin has said that an investigation will take place, but that Yevloyev had resisted arrest.
In July 2008, Human Rights Watch documented dozens of arbitrary detentions, disappearances, acts of torture, and extrajudicial executions in Ingushetia.
The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe denounced Yevloyev's killing as an "assassination" aimed at cracking down on dissent in Ingushetia. The killing also triggered calls for Ingushetia's independence from Russia. The organizer of the protest rally, Magomed Khazibiyev, declared that the Ingush opposition would demand independence, appealing to Russia's recognition of Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia as precedent. 
The funeral of Yevloyev developed into an anti-government protest, in which, according to organizers, several thousands participated. Early on September 2, police dispersed a sleeping crowd of around 50 men who remained in the main square in Nazran, Ingushetia's capital city.
His death investigation case is classified as "Murder by negligence" according to the Criminal Code of Russia. Another criminal case for his illegal detention (according to the investigators, police did not have the right to arrest him when they did) was opened in February 2009, but withdrawn in March 2009.
Court.
On 11 December 2009, a court in Ingushetia found Ibragim Yevloyev guilty of unintentionally murdering Magomed Yevloyev. Ibragim Yevloyev was sentenced to two years of a "colony-settlement". In February 2010 his sentence was mitigated to two years of freedom restriction.
Relatives of Magomed Yevloyev do not trust the official version. In their view, the owner of Ingushetiya.Ru was murdered intentionally. The family addressed the European Court on Human Rights with a complaint.

Odbrana i poslednji dani

Odbrana i poslednji dani (; trans. "The Defense and the Last Days") is the first studio album by former Yugoslav New Wave band Idoli released in 1982.
"Džuboks" magazine critics voted the album the greatest Yugoslav rock album of the 20th century in 1985. The album was polled in 1998 as Yugoslav greatest popular music album in the book "" ("YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music").
Overview.
The band started recording their first long play album during autumn 1981. The record was originally supposed to be produced by the band members themselves with the assistance of Dušan "Spira" Mihajlović, however, Mihajlović soon left the recording sessions, so the album recordings were produced only with help from Mile "Pile" Miletić and Goran Vejvoda. The band's initial plan was an album dealing with religion and tradition, which was seen as potentially provocative due to many aspects of these topics still being a taboo in communist Yugoslavia's public sphere at the time. This was the first release that included a lineup change as Kokan Popović who used to play with Vlada Divljan and Zdenko Kolar in Zvuk Ulice now joined Idoli as their new drummer.
The record was named after Borislav Pekić's 1977 novel "Odbrana i poslednji dani".
Entering the studio, the band members still weren't entirely clear on what they wanted to do, either stylistically or musically. They had many ideas (within the specific context of Pekić's work, and also in broader philosophical scope), but turning them into music and finding satisfactory sound presented a challenge. Due to this experimental trial-and-error approach, the recording process ended up taking almost six months.
Since Idoli were already well-known and popular all across the country, the recording process was documented in Yugoslav media whose many print outlets wondered about the group's creative potential and ability to cope with such ambitious project in light of the fact that it's taking them so long to record the album.
Beside the guitar, Divljan also played the piano, while Šaper played keyboards and synthesizers. Guest appearances featured Goran Vejvoda (Casio synthesizer on "Kenozoik" and "Odbrana" in addition to guitar on "Gde si sad cica-maco"), Mile "Pile" Miletić (guitar solo on "Gde si sad cica-maco"), and Bebi Dol (backing vocals on "Odbrana"). The track "Senke su drugačije" featured Vuk Vujačić (saxophone), Goran Grbić (trumpet) and Slobodan Grozdanović (trombone). 
Since the recording process lasted far too long for Jugoton's liking, the label wanted to release the album as soon as possible. The record came out very quickly in early 1982. Unlike the band's previous releases, which were well accepted both commercially and critically, the new album had the critics divided with reactions ranging from extremely positive to extremely negative. Since the band wanted to present the record as non-commercial, no promotional videos were recorded for the album. Fifty thousand copies of the album were sold in Yugoslavia, which was in sharp contrast to the band's previous release, the "VIS Idoli" EP, that sold roughly 200,000 copies. This resulted the stylistic change of the next album the band recorded.
Album cover and design.
It is often said that the original album cover was supposed to be a reproduction of the Mileševa monastery fresco "White Angel". "Džuboks" magazine even published an article about the upcoming Idoli album with the reproduction as the album cover, but Vlada Divljan has recently squashed such rumours stating that this was never supposed to be the cover, adding that he never liked that idea, even as a rumour. He also explained that it would've been a bit much had they ever thought of choosing it for the cover since the album itself contains lyrics that can be considered rather blasphemous.
It was further rumoured that Jugoton did not agree with the cover, considering it provocative in communist Yugoslavia where religion was very much suppressed. As the alternate solution, photographer and designer Goranka Matić, who did the cover, went to the National Museum in Belgrade and took the photo which was used as the album cover. It was chosen to be a cloth detail from a Saint Nicholas icon. Many people also found the shape of the pattern to be similar to the Swastika and thought it was used as a topic on the album, but Divljan stated that any resemblance of the Swastika was unintentional and that people were reading too much into it. 
The back cover was a detail from a golden background of the icon. The inner sleeve featured a classical civil photo of the band on the left side and a similar photo of the guests and people involved with the recording on the right side.
The font used on the record was a Cyrillic font similar to the one used in the Miroslav's Gospel. The re-release of the album did not feature Cyrillic letters except for the front cover. Also the names were misspelled and thus the album was called "Obrana i posljednji dani", Joca Višković became Joca Đisković, Dragutin Vulinović was changed to Dragutin Đulinović.
Album concept.
The story of the album was inspired by a Borislav Pekić book "Odbrana i poslednji dani". The novel is a comical view on a man who was a lifeguard on the Tisa river during the last years of the World War II. The man, not very educated, got arrested because he found his first drowned victim, a German soldier. The story of the novel continues with presenting and making fun of his internal conflicts due to his lack of knowledge and a macho attitude. Idoli used the mental state of this man who was disoriented and confused with his surroundings and moved it to the urban background and the present moment (used in the song "Kenozoik"). At any point the story of the novel is connected to the album story as the band focused only on the psychological approach of the novel.
The song "Poslednji dani" (originally entitled "Maršal") represents a man who feels very joyous and romantic at night, a time when his hidden personality shows up. Unlike the man in the novel, who loves the river and enjoys spending time at the empty river bank as the river is his "God", the man in the song loves his Marshall (Tito) who is his "God". The record company did not agree with the last verse of the song as it was directly referring to Josip Broz Tito so the band had to change the song title and remove the last verse. 
"Moja si" is one of the strangest Idoli songs. The main character personality becomes divided, and his male personality becomes substituted with a female. In the mirror he sees a woman he would like to be, filled with strange comparisons and statements that shows a deep psychological disorder, which in a different form happened to the main character of the novel.
"Senke su drugačije" present a man determined to leave home. He feels a complete alienation in his surroundings, but is also afraid to leave as the paths are "narrow and dangerous". The structure of the song is keyboard and brass oriented with a march rhythm. In the novel the main character was forced to go to Germany. The story continues with "Nemo" in which the man is completely occupied with the thoughts of the place he is in and continues wandering in the world he can not adopt to. 
The next two tracks deal with a complete opposition to the main character in the novel. The first "Rusija" is a romantic ballad about a college student who lives in an apartment with his girlfriend which is a very strong working-class girl. The main character in the novel did not study and did not like dancing which is the topic of "Igrale se delije", a rockabilly song which calls everyone to dance. The backing vocals lyrics include "Igrale se delije nasred zemlje Srbije" which was a popular folk song during the World War II.
"Jedina (Uzurlikzurli)" is a rockabilly song which tells the story of a man who would like to tell a girl he loves her but has a problem doing it. "Odbrana" (originally entitled "Isus je naš maj") is a sophisticated song about a lonely man who is far away from everything he loves and who misses his old life by the river. "Glavna ptica (skrati svoj dugački jezik)" is talking about barricades, tear-gas, road blocks which are connected to war, the man in the novel could not understand.
Live performances.
Following the release of the album, the band went on tour, but the new album did not reach the audience as their previous releases. The only song which was well accepted by the audience was "Kenozoik" which was usually played first on live appearances. 
One of the first live shows the band did was in Zagreb club Kulušić where Dragan Vulinović, who worked in Radio Belgrade as sound engineer, dressed in black and holding a thurible containing incence was walking along the stage as a thurifer. In Belgrade instead of Vulinović this job was given to a girl. The reaction of the critics to using orthodox elements on concerts was described as "Rock with the smell of incence". The shows lasted for more than two hours and had several encore calls. 
Since Idoli never recorded a live album and live bootleg recordings are very rare, there are no live recordings from this tour. Vlada Divljan with his Old Stars Band often performs songs from "Odbrana i poslednji dani" and most of the songs from the album appeared on his live album "Odbrana i zaštita" in 1996.
Re-release.
The album was one of the first Yugoslav rock albums to be re-released on CD in 1990 with the re-release of "Paket aranžman". Since there were mistakes they did not want to release it until 1992 when a record dealer bought the printed releases and sold them in Belgrade at a very high price. There were 40,000 copies and were sold out in a short period of time. In 2007 the album appeared on Croatia Records' box set VIS Idoli featuring all studio efforts except the "Vidici" single.

Banking in Kyrgyzstan

In mid-1995, the banking system in Kyrgyzstan continued to be dominated by the central savings bank (the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan, created in 1991) and by the three major commercial banks that succeeded the sectoral banks of the Soviet era and remained under state control. Those banks, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank (Agroprombank), the Industrial and Construction Bank (Promstroybank), and the Commercial Bank of Kyrgyzstan, owned 85 percent of banking assets in 1994.
New commercial banks, of which fifteen were established in 1993 and 1994, were owned by individuals or enterprises and had much less financial power than the state-owned banks. The new commercial banks have the right to buy and sell foreign currency and open deposit accounts. The National Bank is the official center of currency exchange, but in the mid-1990s it did not adhere to official exchange rates. In mid-1994, the government established the Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which uses state funds, foreign currency assets, and loans from abroad to aid small and medium-sized enterprises and to invest in targeted spheres of the economy, especially housing, construction, power generation, and agriculture.
The banking system has remained concentrated in the same areas as in the Soviet period. Although some diversification has occurred, loans tend to go to traditional clients. Because new commercial banks are small and initially were owned by state ministries and state-owned enterprises, competition has developed slowly. Through 1994 Soviet-style accounting and reporting systems remained in use, and banking services such as domestic and international payments have remained at the same noncompetitive level as they were prior to 1991.
Capabilities vital to a market-type economy, such as credit risk assessment and project appraisal, are lacking. Post-Soviet regulations on capital funds, exposure limits, and lending practices have not been enforced. The technical infrastructure of the banks also requires substantial overhaul. In addition, the National Bank has been plagued by scandal; the first director, an Akayev protégé, was linked to several illegal financial operations in 1993 and 1994.
The limitations of the banking system have made it unable to efficiently mobilize and allocate financial resources into the national economy. This failure has hindered privatization and other types of economic reform that require substantial amounts of risk capital upon which borrowers can rely. Especially critical are the bad loans held by the three state-owned banks (influenced by government interference in loan decisions, together with poor financial discipline on the part of major enterprises) and eroded capital base. In 1995 the National Bank's outstanding loans to agricultural and industrial enterprises totaled 1 billion som each.

Its source at , at a subalpine marsh forming a pass between Big Dog Mountain, the northernmost major summit of the Shulaps Range, and Poison Mountain, a summit of the Camelsfoot Range, forming a divide with Poisonmount Creek, an upper tributary of the Yalakom River, the main north fork of the Bridge River which divides those two ranges. From there it proceeds northwest, falling steeply from the high plateau between those two ranges, joining at the bottom of that grade with an unnamed creek from Swartz (Fish) Lake, one a chain of lakes in the area of the Mud Lakes Pass, at the divide with the basin of Tyaughton Creek, also a tributary of the Bridge River. From there it turns northeastward in its main trajectory, forming the northwestern flank of the northern Camelsfoot Range. It is joined in its upper reaches by its two main left tributaries, Lone Valley Creek and Dash Creek, which drain the southernmost Chilcotin Plateau just north of the edge of the Chilcotin Ranges and the Spruce Lake Protected Area (also known as the South Chilcotin Park, though park status has been revoked since its creation).

Easley High School Auditorium is a historic building built in 1909 in Easley, South Carolina and now on the National Register of Historic Places. It is historically significant for its long association with education and civic life in Easley in the first half of the 20th century. The building served as Easley’s first and only high school from 1909 to 1940 and was central to the early experience and training of almost every local resident of that period.
Architecture.
Architecturally, the load-bearing masonry building in the Renaissance Revival style is significant for its early efforts to introduce steel trusses into traditional masonry-bearing wall and heavy timber construction. It has also been noted as an outstanding early example of the work of architects Frank H. and Joseph G. Cunningham. The building illustrates the early use of steel trusses to provide a clear-span auditorium with 18-foot ceilings. At the time of construction, use of steel trusses was still in the experimental phase. The design of the building is an early example of “the gradual replacement of load-bearing masonry and heavy timber structures with steel frame construction.” The building has 86 tall windows with segmental arches, laid out like those in many textile mills in the region. 
Later Use.
When the building opened in the fall of 1909, its classrooms allowed the seventh through tenth grades to have their own rooms for the first time (an eleventh grade was added in the 1920-21 school year. 
The school had outgrown the facility by 1938 and a new building was constructed on a different site in 1939-40. Following completion of the new school building, the auditorium was occupied by a shirt manufacturer until 1964. 
From that time until its listing on the National Register, the building went through various periods of vacancy and occupation by a local furniture store for limited storage use. 
Recent Restoration.
The building had fallen into disrepair when the Easley Chamber of Commerce applied for its recognition as one of the most-endangered properties in the state. 
Occupants of the building following its use as a school had torn out interior classroom walls, a portion of the roof had been destroyed as the result of wind damage from a 1998 storm (this was replaced with temporary corrugated metal sheets), and metal panels had been installed over many windows to prevent water damage. All but one original chimney as well as an entry porch on the building's south side had been removed, "virtually all windows and doors" and much of the plaster work were "severely deteriorated".
Following a 1997 study that identified the building as a key ingredient in downtown Easley's revitalization, the town engaged in a period of planning on how to return it to a place of prominence within the community. In the early 2000s the building was rehabilitated and restored to private use as residential condominiums.
The building stands at 112 Russell Street and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The South Carolina Department of Archives and History has additional pictures and information, as well as the NRHP nomination document.

Keough Hot Springs

Keough Hot Springs is located in the Owens Valley of California, about seven miles south of the city of Bishop on US Highway 395.
History.
The area around this hot springs was originally inhabited by the local native Paiutes, who considered the waters sacred. Today there is a very small community of homes, and a commercial resort featuring a large swimming pool which was built and first opened in August 1918 by Philip P. Keough, a former local superintendent of the Wells Fargo stage company. Keough's resort was very popular in the 1920s and 30's and was designed to be a complete health resort. The resort reportedly continued to be a very popular social gathering site for residents of the nearby communities up until the World War II era.
In 1926 the City of Los Angeles purchased the property as a part of its famous water-rights land grab in the Owens Valley. The City's Water and Power Department allowed the resort to remain open under its direction, but absentee management led to a decline in the resort's viability. Leases were offered to various operators, but with only a five-year term. The pool was closed to the public in 1934, but was reopened a few years later by another operator. A new lessee in 1955 performed renovations and the pool once again regained its vitality as a public swimming and recreation area until insurance considerations dictated that it become a membership-only club in 1985.
Today.
In 1998 the Brown Family of Bishop purchased the resort and began major renovation work to once again revitalize the facilities to be opened to the public. A snack bar, picnic area, boutique, massage rooms, and fitness facility complement the pool and therapeutic tubs.
Keough Hot Ditch.
Downstream from the pool, and outside of the small community of Keough's, the hot water cascades down a series of small primitive soaking/wading pools and bathing locations, as the water makes its way toward the Los Angeles Aqueduct. This area, known as the "hot ditch," is utilized as a recreational area where social nudity is practiced List of social nudity places in North America.

Bardstown Historic District

The Bardstown Historic District, comprising the center of Bardstown, Kentucky, is a registered historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Prominent architecture located within the district include the Cobblestone Path, Nelson County Jail, Old L & N Station, Old Talbott Tavern, and Spalding Hall, all individually on the National Register, and the historic old Nelson County Courthouse.
The district consists of twenty-six blocks with a total of 279 properties. Over one third of the buildings in the district are Federal or Georgian architecture dating from the 1780s to 1850, reflecting Bardstown's status as one of the first towns in Kentucky, first settled in 1780 and formally established in 1788. Twenty-four of the blocks are in the initial grid pattern used to lay out the town's lots in 1797.
The town was originally to be called Salem when it was first settled in 1780 by 33 people, on land given as grant to John Owings and David Bard by Virginia governor Patrick Henry. Bard sent his brother William Bard to manage the holdings, and with William donating for a courthouse, the town was renamed Bardstown. In 1789 alone 150 log houses were built in the district. In the antebellum area the district became a cultural center for nearby localities, especially for Catholics; Bardstown had the largest concentration of Catholics of any town in Kentucky for a time. Its decline began when the Louisville and Nashville Railroad decided to initially bypass Bardstown, not building a railroad for the town until 1860, and not extending the line from Bardstown until 1887, after which Bardstown's population remained steady until it became the center of bourbon production.
At different times during the Civil War, commanders from both armies held their headquarters within the district.
The Old Courthouse, which lies in the center of the district surrounded by US 31E and US 150, was constructed in 1892 at the cost of $30,000. It now serves as the Visitor Center for Bardstown, with the new courthouse being built where the original Wal-Mart in Bardstown was located.
Thanks to the Nelson County Historical Society and the 1965 Historical District Zoning laws, much of the district retains its historical nature, save for a few commercial buildings along Third Street, also known locally as Louisville Road (which eventually reaches Louisville, where it is called Bardstown Road). By the 1980s over 200,000 tourists visited the town, which has steadily increased due to the continuing attractions of the Kentucky Bourbon Festival and My Old Kentucky Home State Park, located on the next hill to the east of the historic district.
United States President Jimmy Carter held a town hall meeting in the district in 1979.

Pentacon Six

The Pentacon Six is a single-lens reflex (SLR) medium format camera system made by Pentacon from 1956 to 1992. The Six accepts lenses with the Pentacon Six mount, a breech-lock bayonet mount.
History.
Praktisix.
The Praktisix was manufactured by Kamera Werkstätten (KW). It is a 6×6 SLR modelled on contemporary 35 mm SLRs. It was followed by the Praktisix II and Praktisix IIA, all with minor, relatively cosmetic changes. They all have rather poor reliability, including poor frame spacing.
Pentacon Six.
In 1959 Kamera Werkstätten became VEB Kamera and KinoWerke Dresden. In 1964 they became VEB Pentacon and in 1970, Kombinat VEB Pentacon. With the unification of the East German photographic industry the Praktisix was modified to become the Pentacon Six. Frame spacing was improved through the use of a roller with teeth that is turned by the film as it advances; when the correct length of film has advanced, the mechanism disengages.
When the TTL-metered prism was introduced, the letters 'TL' were added to the name plate but no other changes were made.
The Pentacon Six was imported into the U.S. as the Hanimex Praktica 66 by Australian distributor Hanimex. This was to get around U.S. laws prohibiting direct imports from communist countries.
The Pentacon Six TLs is a version modified to shoot 4×4.5 cm frames for photo IDs.
Exakta 66.
The Exakta 66 is based on the Pentacon Six but was made in West Germany by Exakta GmbH, Nuremberg. The body is rubber coated, the film advance lever moves through a shorter angle, and it has a TTL-metered prism coupled to new Schneider lenses.
The Exakta 66 is not to be confused with several earlier cameras with nearly exactly the same name. These Exakta 6x6 cameras were produced by Ihagee, Dresden, in the pre-war years and with interruptions until 1954.
Viewfinders.
The Praktisix and Pentacon Six comes with a simple waist-level finder with a flip-up cover. A non-metered prism was available for the Pentacon Six, with a TTL-metered prism produced later.
A third-party adaptor allows the metered prism from the Kiev 60 (which is based externally on the Pentacon Six) to be attached to most Pentacon Sixes and Exakta 66's. It is brighter, shows more of the view, and is available new. The same adaptor also allows the Kiev 60 waist-level finder to be used. This finder is reportedly inspired by the one found on Rolleiflex TLR cameras and is also better than the original Pentacon finder.

WCGO (defunct)

WCGO 1600 AM was a radio station licensed to Chicago Heights, Illinois, USA. The station ran 1,000 watts during the day and 23 watts at night. WCGO served southern Cook County, Illinois, most of central and eastern Will County, Illinois, and northern Lake County, Indiana during daytime hours, while its nighttime coverage was more limited.
History.
WCGO began broadcasting in 1959 and was originally owned by Anthony Santucci's South Cook Broadcasting Inc. The station originally broadcast during daytime hours only.
Full service years.
WCGO had long aired a full service format airing local news and talk programming and playing Middle of the road (MOR) music, which at various points included Pop Standards and Easy listening, and later on Adult contemporary music. Much of the station's local news, talk and community programming was simulcast on its sister station 102.3 WTAS in Crete, Illinois, until 1992. In 1985, the station began airing the Warren Freiberg - Libby Collins Show, which had been heard on 106.3 WLNR in Lansing, Illinois since 1973. By 1993 talk programming had replaced most music on the station.
In the summer of 1994, Anthony Santucci sold WCGO to M&M Broadcasting, a firm led by former Hammond, Indiana mayor Thomas McDermott, Sr. In August 1994, WCGO began nighttime operations, with light adult contemporary music airing from 7 pm to 5:59 am, while talk programming continued to air during the day. In 1997, M&M Broadcasting sold the station to Q Broadcasting.
Unforgettable 1600.
From 1997 until the time it was taken off the air in 2009, the station's format was Adult standards, featuring programming from Timeless, and its predecessors; Timeless Favorites, Timeless Classics and Stardust. During this period the station was known as "Unforgettable 1600".
End of operations.
In 2002, the station was purchased by Kovas Communications, who intended to take it, along with 1580 WKKD and 1600 WMCW, off the air in order to enable co-owned station 1590 WONX in Evanston, Illinois to increase its daytime power. WCGO went silent at 6 pm on April 10, 2009, and its license was surrendered to the FCC, enabling 1590 WONX to increase its daytime power from 3,500 watts to 7,000 watts. On April 13, 2009, 1590 WONX took on the WCGO call sign. Kovas Communications had held a construction permit, which would have moved the station to Jenison, Michigan (near Grand Rapids), broadcasting on 1020 kHz at 10,000 watts during daytime hours only, though this move never occurred.

National Broadcasting Services of Thailand

NBTTV, also known as NBT is a television station in Thailand owned and operated by the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand (NBT), a division of the Thai Government. NBTTV is now broadcasting for 24 hours a day effective April 2008.
History.
The broadcasting of TVT11 began on 11 July 1988 when "TV9" (currently known as Modernine TV) split into two channels. It is aimed at viewers in the countryside. Some elements such as sex and violence are censored as NBT is one of the government departments.
NBTTV is also available over the TrueVisions direct broadcast satellite platform on channel 5.
On 1 April 2008, this channel began to broadcast in 24 hours daily, offering more programmes for viewers who stay up late to watch television.
On 1 April 2008, TV11 television stations were once again restructured by Dr.Mun Pattanothai the then Information Minister. TV11 got a new name: "NBTTV".
Educational Television programmes were aired through this channel from 1988 to 1999, alternate with TV9 in the afternoon until 1994 where it airs in the morning. Daytime programming on TV9 started in 1 March 1994 has caused ETV to be broadcast only on TV11.
NBTTV and the radio stations under National Broadcasting Services of Thailand broadcasts from their headquarters in Din Daeng, Bangkok.
NBTTV currently broadcasts under (Very High Frequency) band III, although some parts of Thailand it transmits the signal in UHF where it is normally tuned to band 2. In the Bangkok Metropolitan Area the VHF channel for TV11 is 11, with a weaker transmission on channel 10 in certain parts of the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. It is also available over the NBTi test DVB-T transmission over 658 MHz, SID 2. As of 1 January 2007, it is also available over a test DMB-T/H transmission on Band III.
Criticism.
In 2007, this channel has been criticised for not airing most of the F1 events (only 7 out of the 17 races live, the rest are "delayed telecast"). Many viewers are upset that NBT is not serious about the coverage and this telecast rights should be given back to private TV stations.

The Pentacon Six mount (commonly abbreviated to P6, or Б in Cyrillic) is a breech-lock bayonet lens mount originally used by several medium format single-lens reflex cameras from East Germany.
The lens mount was originally designed by Carl Zeiss Jena and Kamera Werkstätten (KW) for the Praktisix camera. KW later merged with several other companies to become VEB Pentacon; the Praktisix was improved and renamed the Pentacon Six. This camera was manufactured for a much longer time (almost 40 years) and exported widely; hence the lens mount became associated most with the Pentacon Six name, rather than the original Praktisix.
Variants.
Original.
The P6 mount is a simple bayonet mount. It has three short tabs on the lens; they are identical and correct orientation is assured by the placement of a post in front of the "top" tab. A pin holds the diaphragm open for fully open metering and focusing; this pin is released before the shutter is opened.
The lens is inserted into the front of the camera and is held in place by a rotating collar.
This variant is seen on the Praktisix, Pentacon Six, and Kiev 60.
Exakta 66.
The Exakta 66 added a TTL metered prism coupled to the shutter speed dial on the camera body and the aperture ring on the lens. It does this by projecting slightly over the front of the camera, allowing a rotating cam on the specially designed Schneider lenses to tell it what aperture setting was selected. And for lenses with a maximum aperture other than , a separate pin projects from the lens to the prism to tell it the maximum aperture.
Kiev 88 modifications.
The Kiev 88 is essentially a clone of the first Hasselblad - the 1600F/1000F. Like the Hasselblad, it has a threaded lens mount and Kiev-Arsenal manufactured its lens range in both the Pentacon Six mount (for the Kiev 60) and the Kiev 88 screw mount. However, there was interest in using Pentacon Six mount lenses from Carl Zeiss Jena and others on this camera (nicknamed the "Hasselbladski"). Thus various third-parties worked to machine a P6-compatible lens mount into the Kiev 88. A major issue is the fact that the Kiev 88 has a greater flange focal distance than the Pentacon Six, requiring the lens to be recessed into the front of the modified Kiev 88. This causes physical clearance issues with some lenses, particularly the Exakta 66 lenses with a cam and possibly a pin for coupling the lens to a TTL prism.
A consequence of these early modifications is that the lens mount became twist-lock instead of breach-lock; the lens is inserted and turned.
Kiev 88СМ.
The Kiev 88СМ is a later version of the Kiev 88 manufactured with a P6 mount from the factory. Like the earlier Kiev 88 modifications, the lens is recessed in the front of the camera body. However it returns to the breach-lock origins of the mount. It has an "internal collar" that is turned by a tab accessible from the front of the camera.

Adaptors are also available. They allow the use of P6 lenses on Mamiya 645, Pentax 645 and Contax 645 medium format cameras, Canon EF, Canon FD, Nikon F, Minolta AF, Minolta MD, Contax/Yashica, Pentax K, M42, and Leica R 35 mm cameras, as well as Lumix and Olympus micro 4/3 (m4/3), 4/3 system. There are also tilt and shift (but not both) adaptors for most of the 35 mm lens mounts, making use of the larger imaging circle to allow control over perspective or focus.

2008 Men's EuroFloorball Cup Finals

The 2008 Men's EuroFloorball Cup Finals are taking place in Winterthur, Switzerland from 8 to 12 October 2008.
The 2008 EuroFloorball Cup marks the second year in which the new name for the tournament was used (previously known as the European Cup). The tournament also marks its 16th year.
The IFF decided that the tournament will revert to its original format, and will take place during one calendar year, instead of two.
Qualification Format.
Since the top 4 nations at the 2007–08 Men's EuroFloorball Cup were from Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic, the top team in that country automatically qualifies, as well as the reigning champion. 5 teams in total receive automatic qualification.
Since 5 of the 8 spots are filled, the other 3 need to be decided using regional qualification. In Group C, the runners-up to the top team in Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic play for a spot in the finals. In the 2007–08 EuroFloorball Cup, both the top team in Sweden and the runners-up automatically qualified for the tournament, and therefore Group C consisted of 3 teams instead of 4. In Groups A and B, the teams are split into regions: West Europe and East Europe, respectively. The winning team in each group advances to the finals, making the total number of teams eight.
To be eligible to take part in the 2008 Men's EuroFloorball Cup, teams that take place in regional qualification must capture the national title in floorball in their country. If that team does not register, then the 2nd place team can register, and so forth.
Qualifying Venues.
Group A qualifications for Western Europe took place in Frederikshavn, Denmark from 13 to 17 August 2008.<br>
Group B qualifications for Eastern Europe took place in Bratislava, Slovakia from 27 to 31 August 2008.<br>Group C qualifications took place in Helsinki, Finland from 22 to 24 August 2008.

Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976

The Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 was a committee appointed by the New Zealand government to advise on the appropriate reorganisation of the income tax legislation. The Working Party was set up in 1993 as a result of recommendations made by the Valabh Committee set up to review the overall income tax system. The Working Party comprised Arthur Valabh (Chair), Dame Margaret Bazley, and Sir Kenneth Keith.
The Working Party issued two reports on the reorganisation of the then Income Tax Act 1976. Following on from these reports the government in 1995 established a review process for rewriting the income tax legislation, overseen by an advisory panel drawn from the private and public sectors.
The Income Tax Act has since been largely rewritten in a plain English style with a radically re-organised structure, including a unique (for New Zealand) alpha-numeric section referencing system (as opposed to the more usual numeric system. It was re-enacted as the Income Tax Act 1994 and again as the Income Tax Act 2007 as the various parts of the legislation was progressively rewritten.
The Rewrite Advisory Panel was established initially to oversee the rewrite process, but from 2004 it has also been tasked with determining whether there are errors (or "unintended legislative changes") in the rewriting of the Income Tax Acts. The Panel was chaired by Colin Blair (until 2003), Sir Ivor Richardson (2003-08) and the current Chair is David McLay.

Star Wars Expanded Universe

The "Star Wars" Expanded Universe, also known as the EU amongst "Star Wars" fans, encompasses all of the officially licensed, fictional background of the "Star Wars" universe, outside of the six feature films produced by George Lucas. The expanded universe includes books, comic books, video games, spin-off films like "", television series, toys, and other media.
History.
Development.
The early development of the Expanded Universe was sporadic and unrefined, particularly because there was so little official material for the creators to build on. For example, the "Expanded Universe" is generally considered to have begun with Alan Dean Foster's February 1978 "Star Wars" spin-off novel, "Splinter of the Mind's Eye" (although technically it began with Marvel Comics' "Star Wars" #7 in January 1978). This novel drew inspiration primarily from an early draft of the "Star Wars" script and was conceptualized as a possible filmed sequel. Furthermore, while George Lucas was given sole writing credit for the original "Star Wars" novelization, Alan Dean Foster actually ghost-wrote it, contributing heavily to the Universe in the process. While he worked on the novelization, he was given a copy of the working script and a tour of the production.
Much of the early EU material from the early 1980s contained analogies to the real world, rather than embracing the holistic fiction of the "Star Wars" films. Much of this material now seems rather detached from the rest of the EU.
A turning point was reached when West End Games began publishing the "Star Wars Roleplaying Game" in 1987. In order for players of the roleplaying game to create new adventures, West End Games needed to provide supplemental material describing the "Star Wars" universe in previously unknown detail. For example, the Aurebesh alphabet was originally a random piece of set dressing in "Return of the Jedi". Stephen Crane copied those symbols and turned them into a complete and coherent alphabet (which would later be used in the feature films). Developing details like this in a consistent fashion turned West End Games' "Star Wars" products into a de facto reference library for the Star Wars universe, to the point where Lucasfilm actually sent copies of the game supplements to other EU developers to use as source material.
Shortly thereafter, in the early 1990s, Bantam published Timothy Zahn's "Thrawn" trilogy. Widely publicized as the "sequels which were never made", Zahn's novels reignited "Star Wars" fandom and sparked a revolution in "Star Wars" literature. Around this same time, Dark Horse Comics acquired the "Star Wars" license and used it to launch a number of ambitious sequels to the original trilogy, including the very popular "Dark Empire" stories.
All this development began to feed back on itself: West End Games was producing roleplaying supplements detailing the material from Dark Horse's comics and Zahn's novels. Novelists and comic creators were using West End Games' supplements as reference material. Sequels to the novels were being published as comics and vice versa. The scope of the Expanded Universe grew at a prodigious rate.
To date, the bulk of the Expanded Universe has detailed the "Star Wars" universe after the end of "Return of the Jedi", as numerous topics, including the rise of the Galactic Empire, the personal histories of Anakin Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine, and the Clone Wars had been declared off limits by George Lucas prior to the development of the prequel trilogy.
It was decided in the late 1990s that using the Empire as the villains had become repetitive and monotonous. Hence a new threat, the Yuuzhan Vong, was introduced in "The New Jedi Order", more specifically, in the first book of the series, "Vector Prime".
The Expanded Universe and the prequels.
Prior to the release of "", Lucasfilm specifically prohibited development of the time period prior to "A New Hope" in the Expanded Universe (with the exception of the "Tales of the Jedi" series which took place thousands of years before the movies). The release of "Episode I", however, created an entirely new storyline for writers to work from.
Since "The Phantom Menace" was set in a time of peace, it was hard to invent any kind of threat for the heroes to fight against. Thus most material that built on "The Phantom Menace" was either set before or during the film, rather than after.
', on the other hand, introduced another fresh conflict - one which fans had wanted to see for over twenty years. Aside from being explored in comics and novels, the Clone Wars would be given their own animated series ', which would serve to lead up to the release of "". In this series, many battles throughout the galaxy are shown, with the Force shown to seemingly its full extent in fantastic fights, such as Mace Windu single-handedly destroying a whole droid army, without even using a lightsaber. The first (2004) season of the series concludes by introducing the newest villain, General Grievous, an important character in "Episode III". Grievous was also a main player on episodes 21-25, released in 2005 and leading directly to "Episode III". Following the release of "Episode III", events between the two trilogies are now being elaborated, like the Great Jedi Purge.
In addition to adding new possibilities, the prequel trilogy contradicted a number of statements involving the Clone Wars in existing novels. In Timothy Zahn's "Thrawn" trilogy, for example, the dates given for the war were inaccurate. This was since retconned by explaining that the dates were given using the Noghri calendar. Also, the character Admiral Pellaeon makes a specific statement about fighting clones in the Fleet (presumably under the Republic) and that the early clones were "unstable, sometimes spectacularly so." This completely contradicts the prequels, but was later addressed in Karen Travis's "Republic Commando" books by the addition of the Nulls. And again, in book three, "True Colors", Pellaeon makes his first chronologically appropriate appearance as a fresh Republic officer. As well, with all six films officially released, more and more ties between the prequel and original trilogy eras are being made. "Rogue Planet"'s introduction of Zonama Sekot, for example, was both an important tie-in to "Episode II" and part of the resolution for the "New Jedi Order" series. And "Outbound Flight" linked "The Phantom Menace" with several Zahn novels (the "Thrawn" trilogy, "Specter of the Past", "Vision of the Future", and "Survivor's Quest").
Etymology of the term "Expanded Universe".
The term "Expanded Universe" is used generally to refer to the 'extension' of a media franchise, (such as a television show or a series of feature films), typically via other media, such as comics and original novels. The "expanded" works are not necessarily by the same authors nor from the same producers. The term goes back least to the book Expanded Universe (Heinlein) by the science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein.
Story eras.
Unlike the films, which are set over a span over 36 years, the expanded universe takes place over 36,591 years in the "Star Wars" universe. The earliest work involving the expanded universe chronologically is the ' comic series, which is set 36,453 years before the films. The most recent is the ' comic series, which is set at most 138 years after '. The timeline below uses the in-universe BBY dating system, based on the years before and after the Battle of Yavin featured in '.
Set before the rise of the Republic and first mentioned in the "", this era saw the Rakata, a bipedal species from the world of Lehon in the Unknown Regions, establish a galactic empire using the Dark Side of the Force. This era ended with the collapse of their Empire and the establishment of the Galactic Republic in 25,053 BBY.
In this era (set thousands of years before the films), the Jedi are numerous and rule the galaxy, serving as guardians of peace and justice. The "Tales of the Jedi" comics series takes place in this era, chronicling the immense wars fought by the Jedi of old, and the ancient Sith. The and the MMO; "" takes place during this time, as well as the "Darth Bane" series. The Sith Era takes place during this time.
Set in the time around the prequel trilogy this era takes place after the seemingly final defeat of the Sith. In the waning years of the Republic, the Senate was rife with corruption and scandal, and saddled with a bureaucracy so immense that effective governing was nearly impossible. The Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, secretly orchestrated his rise to Supreme Chancellor under the guise of Senator Palpatine and personally engineered the Clone Wars. He promised to reunite the galaxy under a New Order, and destroyed the majority of the Jedi.
With the Old Republic gone, an outcry of resistance begins to spread across the galaxy in protest to the new Empire's tyranny. Cells of Rebellion fight back, and the Galactic Civil War begins. This era begins with the Rebel victory that secured the Death Star plans, and ends after the death of the Emperor high over the forest moon of Endor. The Rebellion starts to reform itself into a body of government, first as the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and later the New Republic. The original trilogy takes place during this era.
Having defeated the Empire at the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance must now transform itself from a militant resistance force into a functioning galactic government. As Imperial territory is reclaimed, the New Republic suffers growing pains, having to fend off insurrections, Imperial loyalists, and wayward warlords. Also, Luke Skywalker, the last of the Jedi, begins to rebuild the Jedi Order and train new apprentices.
With the Jedi Knights now over one hundred strong the New Republic has signed a peace treaty with the remains of the Empire. The galaxy is finally enjoying a peaceful respite from decades of war. It's in this era that a horrible alien menace invades the Republic from beyond known space. The Yuuzhan Vong lay waste to entire worlds in their scourge, as depicted in the novels of "The New Jedi Order". The "Dark Nest" trilogy falls at the end of this era. The mysterious Killik encroach upon Chiss-controlled space, inciting a three-way war between the Chiss, the Killik Hive, and the Galactic Alliance, with Jedi falling in on all sides.
Having reached peace with the Yuuzhan Vong, the newly formed Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (commonly referred to as Galactic Alliance or GA) struggles to keep itself working as a single government. But many threats from inside are joined by a danger that comes from the remains of the Dark Side, that threaten to give rise to a new Sith Lord more powerful than Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine. The new Jedi Order created by Luke Skywalker faces a new era as the heirs of the Skywalker legacy grow up. Jacen Solo has partnered with a nemesis from Luke Skywalker's past, Lumiya, who has promised him only if he becomes the next Sith Lord will he be able to bring peace to the galaxy. The "Legacy of the Force" novels are set at this time. Following the culmination of the "Legacy of the Force" novels, a series titled "Fate of the Jedi" begins, involving Luke as he tries to correct the blemish left on the Jedi Order by Jacen Solo.
Much later in this era, as suggested by the title, is the "" comic series. Set one-hundred thirty years after the films, these comics follow the story of Cade Skywalker, a descendant of Luke Skywalker who has to confront a resurrected Galactic Empire under the control of a new Sith Order.
Works.
Radio and audio drama.
A radio adaptation of "A New Hope" was first broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981. The adaptation was written by science fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was followed by adaptations of the next two films in the original trilogy: "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi".
The radio adaptations were notable for including background material probably created by Lucas but not used for the films. Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, and Billy Dee Williams reprised their roles as Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and Lando Calrissian, respectively; John Williams composed an original score; and Ben Burtt, who designed the sound for all of the "Star Wars" movies, did the same for the radio adaptations.
In 1983, Buena Vista Records released entirely original "Star Wars" audio drama, "Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell". Like the radio adaptations of the films, "Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell" was written by Brian Daley.
For more than a decade, "Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell" was the only "Star Wars" drama not adapted from a feature film. Then, between 1995 and 1998 more than a half dozen audio dramas were released as audio tapes and CD's. These audio dramas were adapted from Dark Horse comic books, and include: "Tales of the Jedi" (1995), "Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina" (1995), "Dark Empire" (1996), "Dark Empire II" (1996), "Empire's End" (1997), "Dark Forces" (1998), and "Crimson Empire" (1998).
Adaptations of the prequel films have not been made at this point.
Books.
"Star Wars"-based fiction predates the release of the first movie, with the 1976 novelization of "A New Hope" (ghost-written by Alan Dean Foster and credited to George Lucas). However, Foster's 1978 novel, "Splinter of the Mind's Eye", was the first Expanded Universe work to be released. Some of the earliest EU material was contributed (in trilogies) by science-fiction writers Brian Daley ("The Han Solo Adventures") and L. Neil Smith ("The Adventures of Lando Calrissian") in 1979 and 1983, respectively. In addition to filling in the time between the movies, this additional content greatly expanded the Star Wars timeline before and after the film series.
"Star Wars" fiction flourished during the time of the original series (1977–1983), but slowed to a trickle afterwards. In 1991, however, Timothy Zahn's celebrated "Thrawn" trilogy debuted, sparking a new interest in the "Star Wars" universe. Since then, several hundred tie-in novels have been published by Bantam and Del Rey. The books have covered most key timeframes in the "Star Wars" universe, but most works have focused on the time period following "Return of the Jedi" and on the events of the Clone Wars. Select books have helped fill in the gaps between the original trilogy movies (e.g., "", "Death Star", "Tales" series).
Other notable books in the series include the "" series by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston, the "Jedi Academy" trilogy and "Young Jedi Knights" series by Kevin J Anderson, the "Republic" and "Imperial Commando" series by Karen Traviss, and the multi-author "New Jedi Order," "Legacy of the Force", and Fate of the Jedi Series.
Comic books and strips.
Marvel Comics published "Star Wars" comic book series and adaptations from 1977 to 1986. A wide variety of creators worked on this series, including Archie Goodwin, Howard Chaykin, Al Williamson, Carmine Infantino, Gene Day, Walt Simonson, Michael Golden, Chris Claremont, Whilce Portacio, Jo Duffy, and Ron Frenz.
Serialized "Star Wars" comic strips, featuring original material written by Roy Thomas, also appeared in Marvel's late-'70s youth-oriented magazine "Pizzazz". As the earliest of these strips were published before original material began to appear in Marvel's "Star Wars" comics (which began by directly adapting the 1977 film) and before publication of "Splinter of the Mind's Eye", these strips hold the distinction of being the first "Star Wars" material in print that was not adapted from one of the films.
In the 1980s, as part of its Star Comics line aimed at young children, Marvel also published the short-lived series ' and ', based on the two Saturday morning cartoons of the same name.
"Star Wars" was also a daily newspaper comic strip from 1979 to 1984. Among the creators were Goodwin, Williamson, and Russ Manning. Dark Horse has also published the newspaper comic strip in a collection entitled "Classic Star Wars".
In the late 1980s, Marvel announced it would publish a new "Star Wars" comic by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy. However, Dark Horse Comics published this story - titled "Dark Empire" -instead, when Marvel's license on the Star Wars property lapsed. Dark Horse has gone on to publish a large number of original adventures set in the "Star Wars" universe. These include: "Star Wars Republic", "Star Wars Empire", "Star Wars Tales" and "Star Wars Tales of the Jedi". Dark Horse has also published the Marvel series in a collection entitled "Star Wars: A Long Time Ago". In addition, the company has reprinted several Japanese manga-interpretations of the films, including ' by Yoshiki Kudo and ' by Shin-ichi Hiromoto.
After The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, it has been reported that Marvel (which Disney bought in 2009) will once again be distributing Star Wars comics once Dark Horse's contract expires.
Computer and video games.
Since 1983, over 120 video games have been published bearing the "Star Wars" name, beginning with "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back" published for the Atari 2600 by Parker Brothers. Other early titles include the "Star Wars" Nintendo Entertainment System game (published by JVC) and three other titles for the Atari 2600.
Atari produced arcade games based on the original trilogy, beginning with "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back", which were both 'flight sim' style games that utilized vector graphics. The third, "Return of the Jedi", used more traditional raster graphics.
"Star Wars" has also opened the way to a myriad of Space-flight simulations that take the space wars of the saga in a more serious manner, teaching the player to fly various "Star Wars" universe starfighters along the lines of more traditional "Modern Aircraft" flight simulators. The first among these were ' and its two expansions, "B-Wing" and "Imperial Pursuit", dealing with the Rebellion's side of the war, taking place in the period right before, and up to, the destruction of the first Death Star. The second was ', dealing with the Empire's starfighters at the time prior to "Episode VI". Both games were released for DOS and Macintosh. "TIE Fighter" also had an expansion disk, "Defender of the Empire". In addition, both the original "X-Wing" and "TIE Fighter" games saw two collector's edition releases (one for DOS and another for Windows 9x) which featured enhanced graphics quality and added missions. Newer simulators are also available, with "" in the lead.
The first "Star Wars" first person shooter, ', was introduced by LucasArts in February 1995. Telling the story of Kyle Katarn, Imperial soldier gone mercenary, the game featured a little over a dozen levels where the player explored various original and familiar settings. Featuring an original and interactive soundtrack by renowned game composer Clint Bajakian using the iMUSE sound system, along with state-of-the-art graphics, the game succeeded in capturing many gamers' imaginations. The 1997 sequel, ', was notable for having a few cut scenes which were made up of live-action footage of certain Expanded Universe characters, such as Kyle Katarn.
"Rogue Squadron" was a cross-platform title on Nintendo 64 and PC which allowed the player to experience a more arcade-action version of the same gameplay in "X-Wing" and "TIE Fighter". The game consisted of piloting several different "Star Wars" vehicles through missions on planet surfaces and in space. "Rogue Squadron" saw two sequels, both on the Nintendo GameCube system.
"" allowed players to compete in the "Star Wars" universe on a larger scale, focusing more on the strategic aspect of handling (or defeating) a rebellion, with resource management and agent-allocation, as well as large-scale conflicts between entire fleets of starships.
' by BioWare, ' by Obsidian Entertainment are recent additions to the EU, and take place in the Old Republic era, right after the Mandalorian Wars.
Other games are: ', ', "Battlefront Renegade Squadron, Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron", ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', and "". Also released were "Rebel Assault" and "Rebel Assault II" which are considered by many to be more interactive movie than actual video game.
On September 16, 2008, LucasArts released ' which bridges the events from "Episode III: Revenge of the Sith", to "Episode IV: A New Hope". The game centers on Darth Vader's secret apprentice, called Starkiller, who goes out to destroy the last of the Jedi. A sequel, ', was released on October 26, 2010 that follows Starkiller as he attempts to exact revenge on Vader following the events of the first game. Both games received a novelization treatment released alongside them that expands on the events of the game and ties them in to the larger Expanded Universe.
In the fall of 2008, it was announced that "" (an MMORPG) was being developed by BioWare for the PC, it is intended to be a sequel to the very successful "Knights of the Old Republic" ("KOTOR") games, also produced by BioWare. Fans of the series were told to expect "The Old Republic" to be "KOTOR 3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8" and "9"...alluding to the massive content the game is supposed to be planned to launch with.
Board and roleplaying games.
In a 1996 game from Hasbro, entitled ', which is set during the era of the original trilogy, new live-action scenes were shot of Darth Vader on the Death Star around the events of '. The footage was made available on a special VHS tape, included in the box of the game. When playing the board game, the players could put in the tape, which would play while they were in a game. David Prowse reprised his role as Vader, and James Earl Jones returned as the voice of Vader. Some of the original crew for "" came back to shoot these scenes.
A "Star Wars" board game was also released by Ravensburger in Germany in 2002.
Several editions of the "Star Wars" role playing games have been published.
Bill Slavicsek worked on all the editions. He included a conversion table (from the previous d6 versions to the new d20 version) at the end of the 3rd edition that helped "Star Wars" RPG players adapt to the new d20 version.
In 2005, Hasbro developed and released a DVD TV Game based on "Star Wars" and utilizing the "Trivial Pursuit" game-play format.
Attractions.
In 1987, Lucasfilm and Disney, utilizing the power of ILM, teamed up to produce Star Tours, an amusement park simulator ride through the "Star Wars" galaxy. It was to be placed in the Tomorrowland section of the park, in the location of the dark ride Adventure Thru Inner Space. Later on it was decided to be put in Disney studios. The ride is advertised as an opportunity to take a tour to the forest moon of Endor via the Starship 3000. The ship is controlled by a robot named Rex (voiced by Paul Reubens of Pee Wee Herman fame), who happens to be new at giving the tours, and your riding experience happens to be his first time at the controls. Along the way, the rider encounters many mishaps, including run-ins with Imperial Star Destroyers, and near collisions with asteroid fields, until their ship finally makes it safely back into the port. A Star Tours II has been announced by George Lucas, to be based on prequel situations, although exactly when it will begin production or its opening date are yet to be confirmed. A limited-run line of action figures is also available exclusively in the Star Tours gift shop, based on droid characters from the ride and the line leading into it.
The ride was closed temporarily in 2010 and renovated under the title "". The ride reopened in all parks in 2011, while the Tokyo Disneyland version opened in May 2013.
Toys.
In addition, many other toys have been made. The "Star Wars" toy phenomenon began in 1978 with the original action figures, toy lightsabers and blasters, twelve-inch figures, toy vehicles, and much more products. These toys are known as the vintage "Star Wars" toys. Today many of these "vintage" figures are quite rare and hard to find. Many are also worth a lot of money. Recently, a toy line called "Star Wars: The Original Trilogy Collection", brought back elements of the original vintage toy line, such as vintage packaging. With the coming of "", Lego began creating little (and quite large) buildable "Star Wars" characters and scenes. Recently, the Lego creators have invented light-up lightsabers for their figures. Lego has even licensed these toys in the "LEGO Star Wars" video game series (mentioned above).
Many types of toys have been made. Darth Vader helmets and voice changers now inhabit the shelves, usually right next to the Ultimate Lightsaber Kit, which contains parts to design and assemble your own functional lightsaber toy. The term "Expanded Universe" was first used with Kenner's assortments of action figures based on the various "Star Wars" novels, comic books, and video games. Previous toys based on novels were sold by Galoob as "Epic Collections."
In the late 1990s, "Star Wars" toys reached deep into the Halloween and specialty markets where Officially Licensed Star Wars helmets, costumes and collectibles could be purchased easily from online retailers on the internet and from retail chains. "Star Wars" fans of all ages could easily purchase like "Star Wars" costumes for Halloween and plays from online specialty stores. From lightsabers and blasters to robes and helmets, many of today's costumes and accessories are licensed through Rubies Costume Company of New York and sold through independent and retail chain stores. Likewise, companies such as Hasbro have developed and sold toy weapons, action figures and collectibles from the "Star Wars" series.
With the development of the newest "Star Wars" and popular TV series, "", even more toys have been developed by introducing new characters and adventures to a younger generation outside of the original "Star Wars" series.
Continuity and canonicity.
The Expanded Universe is intended to be a continuation, and an expansion, on the six "Star Wars" theatrical films produced by George Lucas from 1977–2005. All EU material, combined with that presented in the films is meant to function as a complete story. However, in order to allow this story to function as a whole, it must be kept under in an order of continuity. Lucasfilm holds this of such high importance that a teams' sole job at Lucasfilm is maintaining continuity between Lucas's films, and the EU, which is written by many other authors and artists, many times out of order, and with many different ideas. Lucas, however, was free to go in any direction he wishes in his films to tell the story he intends. He acknowledges and supports the works of the EU but tells the stories he wants to tell in the six films. When asked in an interview his general opinion on the EU, he replied:
George Lucas has also stated that as far as he was concerned the rule of the Sith ended with the death of Palpatine and freedom and democracy were restored to the galaxy with the Jedi's return, as he symbolized this by including the Senate building and the Jedi temple during the celebratory scenes at the end of "Return Of The Jedi". He has stated that although he is aware of EU literature and welcomes its creativity, he has no part in the resurrection of Palpatine and the Yuuzhan Vong invasions (though this would contradict comments by Tom Veitch that it was Lucas himself who suggested they resurrect Palpatine instead of using the original idea of a Vader impostor in the "Dark Empire" storyline).
George Lucas retains ultimate creative control over the "Star Wars" universe. For example, the "death" of central characters and similar changes in the status quo must first pass his screening before authors are given the go-ahead. In addition, Lucasfilm Licensing devotes considerable effort to ensure continuity between the works of various authors across multiple companies. Nothing in the Expanded Universe is supposed to contradict the films or any other part of the Expanded Universe. Upon occasion, Lucas's new films, reedited Original Trilogy films, or statements have contradicted existing EU material, and several retcons have been used to fix these inconsistencies.
Some purists reject the Expanded Universe as apocrypha, believing that only the events in the film series are part of the "real" "Star Wars" universe. This line of thought is supported to the extent that some Expanded Universe material released before Lucas's prequel films drew erroneous conclusions that Lucas later corrected. However, elements of the Expanded Universe have been adopted by Lucas for use in the films. For example, the name of planet Coruscant first appeared in Timothy Zahn's novel "Heir to the Empire" before being used later in the prequel trilogy (although its pronunciation changed) - though the planet itself, under a different name, had existed in a previous version of the script to "Return of the Jedi". Also, the Twi'lek Jedi Aayla Secura originally appeared in the ongoing Dark Horse Comics series "Republic" - apparently Lucas saw the cover which featured her and liked the look of her character so much that he included her in the Jedi battle at the end of "", played by Lucasfilm employee Amy Allen, and her demise is later shown in the Order 66 Jedi Purge scenes of "Revenge of the Sith". These examples sometimes end up confusing the issue, as they have blurred the lines between the Expanded Universe and "his world".
There are also minor disputes about what is, and what is not, part of the Expanded Universe. For example, the two "Star Wars" spin-off films: ' and ' were written by George Lucas and are films, but they are not one of the six main films in the series, so they are usually considered to be a part of the Expanded Universe.
Official levels of canon.
The Holocron is an internal database maintained by Lucas Licensing for the express purpose of trying to maintain continuity within all licensed products. The Holocron was originally sorted into four levels of canon, reflecting LFL's canon and continuity policies: G, C, S, and N. A fifth level, T, was recently instituted and comprises the CGI series "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" and the currently untitled live action Star Wars television series which has yet to begin any form of production. See the article on Star Wars canon for greater detail.
Lucas's use of the Expanded Universe.
C-canon elements from licensed creators have been known to appear in Lucas' films. Most of these are brief, cameo appearances, almost taking the form of Easter eggs (which may have been added by animators or others under Lucas, rather than specifically dictated), but others are more substantial:
Lucas has often worked very closely with EU creators:
On the other hand, Lucas has been known to ignore C-canon material when creating his films, even when this material is well-established and central to the EU continuity. This has led some to believe that the C-canon material is not, in fact, closely aligned with Lucas' vision. Examples of these inconsistencies include:

Only Love Can Break a Heart

"Only Love Can Break a Heart" is the title of a popular song from 1962 (see 1962 in music) performed by the American singer-songwriter Gene Pitney. The song was written by Hal David (words) and Burt Bacharach (music) and appears on Pitney's second album "Only Love Can Break a Heart".
Pitney had enjoyed some success as a songwriter prior to breaking through as a performer in his own right. He wrote the songs "Hello Mary Lou", "Rubber Ball", and "He's a Rebel", the latter a number-one "Billboard" Hot 100 hit for The Crystals in 1962. Ironically, Pitney's success as a singer was beginning at this time, and "He's a Rebel" kept "Only Love Can Break a Heart" from topping the "Billboard" pop chart, where it spent one week at number two., and two weeks atop the "Billboard" Easy Listening chart in October and November 1962. "Only Love Can Break a Heart" also reached number 16 on the "Billboard" R&B chart.
Other artists have recorded cover versions of "Only Love...", including country music singers Sonny James and Kenny Dale. Both versions reached the Top 10 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart during the 1970s. James' version peaked at No. 2 in March 1972, held out of the top by Freddie Hart's "My Hang-Up Is You." As a result, "Only Love ..." just missed continuing James' record-breaking streak of consecutive number-one singles, which had reached 16. Dale's version of the song reached number seven on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1979 and it was his biggest hit on the country charts.
Dionne Warwick released her version of the song as a single in 1977, but it only reached number nine of the "Bubbling Under" portion of the "Billboard" Hot 100. Bobby Vinton also recorded the song in 1977, and it reached number 99 on the Hot 100. Vinton's version appears on his album "The Name Is Love".

Black existentialism

Black existentialism or Africana critical theory is a school of thought that "critiques domination and affirms the empowerment of Black people in the world". Although it shares a word with existentialism and that philosophy's concerns with existence and meaning in life, it "is predicated on the liberation of all Black people in the world from oppression". It may also be seen as method, which allows one to read works by African-American writers such as W.E.B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Ralph Ellison in an existentialist frame. Lewis Gordon argues that black existentialism is not only existential philosophy produced by black philosophers but is also thought that addresses the intersection of problems of existence in black contexts.
Black existential philosophy.
Black existential philosophy is a species of Africana philosophy and black philosophical thought. Africana philosophy is a form of philosophy emerging out of the critical thought of the African diaspora. Black philosophical thought pertains to the ideas emerging from black-designated peoples. Such people include, for example, Australian Aboriginal people, who often refer to themselves as "black." There is thus also work in black existential philosophy from Australia, such as those organized through forums and articles by Danielle Davis in the Oodgeroo Unit of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. 
The first African American to earn a doctorate from Harvard University earned his degree in sociology, however the work of W. E. B. Du Bois have been honored in the canon of African American philosophy. W. E. B. Du Bois' notion of double consciousness has been revisited by many scholars as a notion doused in existentialism. Du Bois addressed several problems germane to black existential philosophy. He raised the question of black suffering as a philosophical problem. Was there meaning behind such suffering? He also observed that black people were often studied and addressed in public discussions as problems of the modern world instead of as people facing problems raised by modern life. Black people, he argued, often faced double standards in their efforts to achieve equality in the wake of enslavement, colonialism, and racial apartheid. This double standard led, he argued, to "twoness" and "double consciousness." The twoness was the experience of being "black" and "American," where the two were treated as contradictory. Double consciousness followed in two forms. The first was of the experience of being seen from the perspective of white supremacy and anti-black racism. It was from the perspective of seeing themselves as lowly and inferior. The second, however, as Paget Henry argues, involves seeing the contradictions of a system that in effect blames the victim. That form of double consciousness involves seeing the injustice of a social system that limits possibilities for some groups and creates advantages for others while expecting both to perform equally. That black people were imprisoned for challenging the injustices of a social system born on the memorable phrase, "All men are created equal...," is a case in point, and the subsequent criticism of whether "men" meant "women too" pushes this point further, as Frederick Douglass, Anna Julia Cooper, and other earlier 19th century black critical thinkers contended. Du Bois also theorized the importance of black music, especially the spirituals, and through them raised the question of the inner-life of black people, which he referred to as their "soul," which in his discussion of double consciousness became "souls" (see, e.g., the work of Terence Johnson, for example, Terence Johnson, "'My Soul Wants Something New': Reclaiming the Souls Behind the Veil of Blackness," in The Souls of W.E.B. Du Bois: New Essays and Reflections, eds. Jason R. Young and Edward J. Blum GA: Mercer University Press, 2009, pp. 110–133). And Du Bois also raised the problem of history in the study of black existence. He noticed that double standards affected how history is told, and that the misrepresentation of history as an apology for white supremacy and colonialism led to the degradation of black people as passive objects of history instead of makers of history. This occlusion depended on denying the struggles for freedom waged by black people in the effort to expand the reach of freedom in the modern world.
A danger of black suffering is that it could lead to a sense of pointlessness of black existence and a lack of self-worth. Cornel West has addressed the problem of Black Nihilism and its effect on the African-American community.
The proper starting point for the crucial debate about the prospects for black America is an examination of the nihilism that increasingly pervades black communities. Nihilism is to be understood here not as a philosophic doctrine that there are no rational grounds for legitimate standards or authority; it is, far more, the lived experience of coping with a life of horrifying meaninglessness, hopelessness, and (most important) lovelessness. The frightening result is a numbing detachment from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world. Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a coldhearted, mean-spirited outlook that destroys both the individual and others.
Black suffering is also examined by the Martinican philosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon (1925–1961). In his book "Black Skin, White Masks" (Grove Press, 1967; original French 1952), he argued that the modern world afforded no model of a normal black adult. Instead, there are the pathologies of the black soul, which he calls a white construction. This problem placed black people in an alienated relationship with language, love, and even their inner dream life. Although he was careful to claim that there are exceptions to these claims, the general situation is as follows. Blacks who master the dominant language are treated either as not really black or receive much suspicion. Worse, they find themselves seeking white recognition, which affirms the role of whites as the standard by which they are judged. The matter repeats itself with love. Black women and black men seeking white recognition do so, he argued, through asking for recognition from white male symbols of authority. That effort is self-deceiving. It makes such black women ask to be loved as white instead of as women, and it makes such black males fail to be men. Fanon also brings out the philosophical problem of reason and its relation to emotions by considering whether a flight into Negritude, the intellectual movement coined by Aime Cesaire, could enable blacks to love themselves by rejecting white reason. But Jean-Paul Sartre's criticism in "Black Orpheus" led Fanon into "changing his tune" by realizing that such a path was still relative to a white one and faced being overcome in expectations of a "universal" humanity, which for Sartre was a revolutionary working class. Fanon's response was that he needed not to know that, and later on in "A Dying Colonialism" (Grove Press, 1967; original French 1959), he pointed out that although whites created the Negro, it was the Negro who created Negritude. His point was that it was still an act of agency, and that theme of being what he called "actional" continued in his writings. At the end of "Black Skin, White Masks", he asked his body to make of him a man who questions. Fanon's point was that racism and colonialism attempted to over-determine black existence, but as a question, black existence faced possibility and could thus reach beyond what is imposed upon it. In "The Wretched of the Earth" (Grove Press, 1963; original French 1961), he returned to this question at the historical level by demanding the transformation of material circumstances and the development of new symbols with which to set afoot a new humanity.
Black existential philosophical thought was also influential in the South African anti-apartheid movement through the thought of Steve Bantu Biko. In I Write What I Like, Biko continues Fanon's project of thinking through alternative conceptions of humanity and offers his theory of Black Consciousness. Black consciousness applies to anyone who is involved in anti-racist struggle and is marked as the enemy of an anti-black, racist state. Thus for Biko, all people of color—indigenous Africans, Asians, mixed peoples, and whites who are "blackened" by their allegiance to anti-racism—are black. Biko presents here a political view of identity that resists a prior essence of black identity. One becomes black, reminiscent of Simone de Beauvoir's observation that one becomes a woman. South African philosophers influenced by Biko's existentialism include Noël Chabani Manganyi. The influence of Biko's thought is also discussed in Andile, Mngxitama, Amanda Alexander, and Nigel Gibson (eds), Biko Lives!: Contesting the Legacies of Steve Biko (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008).
Black existential philosophy came to the academy in the 1970s in the work of William R. Jones, who argued for a humanistic response to black suffering through facing the absurd as found in the thought of Albert Camus and dealing with the contradictions of theological beliefs pointed out by Jean-Paul Sartre. Jones drew upon existential philosophy to reject non-verifiable claims posed by black theology, where history is presented as God trying to liberate black people. Historical evidence, Jones suggests, says otherwise. Instead of relying on God, black people should take their lives and history into their own hands and build a better future for human kind. This is not to say that Jones took the position that blacks who believe in God should not love God. His point is that they should not rely on God for the elimination of injustice on earth.
A philosopher heavily influenced by Du Bois, Fanon, and Jones is Lewis Gordon, who argues that black existential philosophy "is marked by a centering of what is often known as the 'situation' of questioning or inquiry itself. Another term for situation is he lived- or meaning-context of concern. Implicit in the existential demand for recognizing the situation or lived-context of Africana people's being-in-the-world is the question of value raised by people who live that situation. A slave's situation can only be understood, for instance, through recognizing the fact that a slave experiences it. It is to regard the slave as a value-laden perspective in the world" ("Existence in Black" 1997, pp. 3–4). Gordon later argues in "Existentia Africana" that such a concern leads to a focus in black existential philosophy on problems of philosophical anthropology, liberation, and critical reflection on the justification of thought itself. The first asks the question, What is a human being? The second asks how can one become free. And the third is critical even of the methods used to justify the first two. Gordon argues that these questions make sense because enslaved, colonized, and dehumanized people are forced to question their humanity. That leads to questioning the meaning of being human. He argues that concerns with liberation make sense for people who have been enslaved, colonized, and racially oppressed. Because these questions are posed as objects of inquiry and demand the transformation of consciousness such as the transition from Du Bois's first form of double consciousness to the second, critical one, Gordon advocates a black existential phenomenological approach, which he sometimes call a postcolonial phenomenology or a decolonial one.
A philosopher influenced by Gordon is Nelson Maldonado-Torres, whose "Against War" (Duke UP, 2008) offers a "decolonial reduction" of the forms of knowledge used to rationalize slavery, colonialism, and racism. Drawing upon ideas from Aime Cesaire, the Lithuanian Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, Frantz Fanon, and the Argentinian philosopher Enrique Dussel, Maldonado-Torres calls the practices of dehumanization in the modern world "Hitlerism" and advocates the "decolonial sciences" (race and ethnic studies, Africana studies, women's studies) as critical forms of knowledge to articulate the humanistic project demanded by Fanon.
There is also the growing area of black feminist existential philosophy. Foundations of this area of thought are in the 19th century and early 20th century thought of Anna Julia Cooper, who explored problems of human worth through challenging the double standards imposed upon black populations in general and black women in particular. She argued, in response to the racist claims of black worthlessness (that the world would be better off without black people), that the measure of worth should be based on the difference between contribution and investment. Since very little was actually invested in black people but so much was produced by them, she argued that black worth exceeds that of many whites. She used the same argument to defend the worth of black women. More recently in the academy, black feminist existential philosophy is taken up by Kathryn Gines, founder of the Collegium of Black Feminist Philosophers. Gines's work brings together ideas from Cooper, Sartre, Fanon, Hannah Arendt, bell hooks, and recent work in Africana phenomenology and black popular culture in such articles as: "Sex and Sexuality in Contemporary Hip-Hop" in Hip Hop and Philosophy: Rhyme 2 Reason—A Series in Pop Culture and Philosophy, eds. Derrick Darby and Tommie Shelby (Chicago: Open Court, 2005) and "The Black Atlantic, Afrocentricity, and Existential Phenomenology: Theoretical Tools for Black European Studies," Black European Studies, on line at Synlabor.de.
Black existential literature.
Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man", the archetype of black existentialist literature, is one of the most revered and reviewed novels written by an African-American writer. It presents examples of absurdism, anxiety and alienation in relation to the experience of the black male in mid-1900s America. The namelessness of the main character of the novel, a figure based on Ellison's own life, points to the trauma of black people receiving names that were forced on them from the violence of slavery. That renaming was meant to inaugurate a loss of memory, and that process of dismemberment is explored in the novel as the protagonist moves from one abusive father figure to another—white and black—to a culminating reflection on living as an invisible leech off of the system that produces light. In Ellison's novel, the only black characters who seemed somewhat free were those designated insane, as in the famous scene at the Golden Day bar where a group from an insane asylum became the critical voice early in the novel.
The African-American writer who was the closest to the Sartrean existentialist movement was Richard Wright, although Wright saw himself as working through the thought of Søren Kierkegaard with a focus on themes of dread and despair, especially in his novel "The Outsider". Dismayed with his experience of American racism in the south, Wright sought refuge in a Parisian life. In France, he was heavily influenced by Les Temps modernes members Sartre, de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty. The existential novels that he wrote after leaving the United States, such as "The Outsider", never received the high critical acclaim of "Native Son". In his famous introduction to "Native Son", Wright made concrete some of the themes raised by Du Bois. He pointed to the injustice of a system in which police officers randomly arrested young black men for crimes they did not commit and prosecutors who were able to secure convictions in such cases. He also argued that Bigger Thomas, the anti-hero of the novel, was produced by such a system and is often envied by many as a form of resistance to it. Wright's insight portended the emergence, for example, of the contemporary black "gangsta," as portrayed in gangsta rap.
In retrospect, James Baldwin has been considered by others as a Black existentialist writer; however he was quite critical of Richard Wright and suspicious of his relationship with French intellectuals.
Baldwin also brought questions of interracial and bisexual relationships into consideration and looked at the question of suffering as a struggle to defend the possibility of genuine human relationships in his novel "Another Country". 
The writings of Toni Morrison are also contributions to black existentialism. Her novel "The Bluest Eye" examines how "ugliness" and "beauty" dominate black women's lives as imitations of white women as the standard of beauty. Her famous novel "Beloved" raises the question of the trauma that haunts black existence from slavery. (See, for example, the discussion of that novel in Marilyn Nissim-Sabat, "Neither Victim Nor Survivor" Lexington Books, 2009, chapter 8.)

Publication history.
While the current version of Gorilla City debuted in "The Flash" vol. 1 #106, the very first appearance of a location identified as Gorilla City occurred four years earlier in Congo Bill vol. 1 #6 (July 1955), by George Kashdan and Nick Cardy. The intelligent Gorillas in this story came from a "two mooned world" that Congo Bill assumed to be Mars.
Fictional location history.
After an alien spacecraft crashes into the jungles of Africa, local gorillas become hyper-intelligent and acquire telepathic abilities. These gorillas form Gorilla City. The city led by Solovar quickly creates technology far surpassing that of humanity and cloaks itself from human society. Flash first finds out about the city due to Gorilla Grodd, who probed Solovar's mind to find how to control minds, before trying to take over Gorilla City, then the world. However Flash defeated him. Gorilla Grodd took over the city briefly using neo-magnetic radiation. The radiation caused the rest of the gorillas to adore him, and they made him their king.
During "JLA Annual" #3 (the JLApes storyline), Gorilla City reveals itself to the world and joins the United Nations. However Solovar was killed by a bomb apparently set off by human terrorists.

The Narrows (Knox County, Texas)

The Narrows is the name given to a geological feature located 4 to 6 miles (6.4 to 9.7 km) east of Benjamin in Knox County, Texas. It is a narrow crest running east-to-west along a hogback dividing the watershed of the Wichita River to the north from that of the Brazos River to the south. That is, precipitation falling to the north of the crest will flow into the Wichita River, and thence into the Red River and ultimately the Mississippi, while precipitation falling to the south will flow into the Brazos and then directly into the Gulf of Mexico. Before white settlers arrived in the area, buffalo were drawn to the spot due to the presence of buffalo grass and fresh springs, with the result that the area was known as prime hunting ground to several tribes of Indians, including the Comanche, Wichita, Kiowa, Apache, Seminole, and Tonkawa. Evidence of their battles and campgrounds is still being discovered. Later, the white man used these same Indian-worn trails to traverse the area. Today, as they have been since the coming of the white man, the canyons and ravines of the area's badlands topography are used for ranching purposes.
US 82 runs directly along the crest, and the area, being picturesque, has become a popular tourist attraction; a roadside park and historical marker have been set up along the highway.

Sisters of the Child Jesus

The Sisters of the Child Jesus () are Religious Sisters founded in 1676 in Le Puy-en-Velay, France, by Ann-Marie Martel (1644–1673) to care for those in need. Divided among various independent religious congregations following the same spirit and tradition, they serve around the world. Since 1903 they have used the postnominal initials of R.E.J..
History.
Foundation.
Martel, the daughter of a local magistrate, had grown up in affluence and comfort. A deeply spiritual young woman, she opened her desire for finding a path in life in keeping with her religious beliefs. After a period of hearing her confessions for a period sufficient to know her heart and character, her spiritual director, the Abbé Louis Trond of the Society of Saint-Sulpice, suggested that she undertake the practical expression of her faith by helping with a small hospital in the city for destitute women.
Martel followed Trond's suggestion and started to help there, where she would care for them and instruct them in the faith, letting them know of God's love of them. She was soon asked to teach the catechism to the children of the city who were living on the street. Her example and reputation led other young women to join her in this ministry to the needy of the city. The mission then expanded to reach out to the lace-makers working in the factories of the city. By 1669 the number of women sharing this vision had grown to the point that their work had spread throughout the city and out into the surrounding villages and had begun to live in community.
Martel died in 1673, at the age of 27, without seeing the formalization of her work into a religious congregation. (The cause for her canonization was accepted for study by the Holy See in 2005.) The society of instructors she had founded did not achieve the status within the Church of a religious community until 1676, when, under the guidance of a canon of Rheims, John Baptist de la Salle, whom they met after their establishment of a convent there, they received the official approval of Armand de Béthune, the Bishop of Le Puy, as the Ladies and Girls of Instruction. After the group underwent a formal period of novitiate, they professed a public vow of chastity in 1678. With the exception of the community at Versailles, founded in 1680, most of the various communities, previously independent, merged into the Congregation of the Sisters of the Child Jesus in 1708, and received their first common Rule of Life in 1760.
Dispersal and re-establishment.
The work of the congregation was ended with the French Revolution and the Sisters of the congregation were scattered. This situation did not last long, however, as a new community of Instructors was formed in Le Puy by Mademoiselle de Senicrose.
Soon after that, in 1804, Marie Maisonobe opened a school in Aurillac following the format of the congregation. By 1812 the Catholic Church had re-established itself sufficiently that she was able to begin her formal formation in Puy-en-Velay. This developed into an autonomous congregation in 1843, whose first Superior General was Louise Maisonobe, niece of Marie. This congregation later merged with the Sisters of Providence of Rodez in 1856. They later opened schools in Argentina (1888) and in Belgium in 1903, the year of the definitive separation of Church and State and France.
Through the work of different foundresses in other cities of France, other autonomous congregations became to develop: Digne (1840), Claveisolles (1858) and Chauffailles (1859).
Mission to Canada.
In 1896 the congregation accepted the request of Pierre-Paul Durieu, O.M.I., the first Bishop of New Westminster in British Columbia, to work with the people of the First Nations. Four Sisters of the congregation, under the leadership of Mother Aimée, left Le Puy and traveled to Canada, arriving in Williams Lake. From this time the congregation has taught in various schools and built schools & foundations across western Canada. Eventually the Sisters in Western Canada served in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
Reunion.
After the reorganizations required by the various congregations of the Sisters of the Child Jesus around France about 1920, the desire to re-join developed, in order to better answer the needs of the Sisters' ministries. In 1949 the congregation based in Versailles merged with that based in Le Puy. Then, in 1952, the congregations of Le Puy and Aurillac merged to form a single congregation.
Current status.
The congregation based in Le Puy has Sisters serving in Argentina, Belgium, Burkina Faso, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, France, Ivory Coast and Vietnam. They served in Liberia from 1966 to 1992.
The congregation based in Chauffailles remains autonomous and currently has houses in France, Canada, Cambodia (since 2002) and Japan.

John Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst

John Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst (Zerbst, 29 July 1677 – Zerbst, 7 November 1742), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst.
He was the eldest son of Karl William, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Sophie, daughter of August, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels.
Life.
In 1718, after the death of his father, John Augustus succeeded him as prince of Anhalt-Zerbst.
John Augustus married Fredericka (b. Gotha, 24 March 1675; d. Karlsbad, 28 May 1709), daughter of Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, on 25 May 1702 in Zerbst. They had no children. He was married for a second time to Hedwig Fredericka (b. Weiltingen, 18 October 1691; d. Zerbst, 14 August 1752), daughter of Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Württemberg-Weiltingen, on 8 October 1715 in Zerbst. This union was also childless.
Since John Augustus died without issue, the elder line of Anhalt-Zerbst became extinct. On his death, he was succeeded by his distant cousins, the princes of Anhalt-Dornburg.

Pomona City Stables

The Pomona City Stables, also known as the Pomona City Yards Brick Building, is a stables building completed in 1909 to house horses owned by the City of Pomona, California. 
Built at a cost of $6,000, the Pomona City Stables building was designed by Pomona architect Ferdinand Davis from the firm of Davis and Higgs. Davis also designed several other prominent buildings in Pomona, including the Currier House (1907), the Masonic Lodge, the Ebell Club, and Trinity Methodist Church. Located on White Avenue, just north of the Southern Pacific railroad tracks, the Pomona City Stables opened in April 1909 and were described by the "Los Angeles Times" as "models of convenience" that would provide "ample room for the city stock and implements for some time to come." Upon its opening, the building was occupied by twenty-two head of horses owned by the city and a caretaker. 
The building is reported to be one of the oldest municipal buildings extant in California. In 2003, the Pomona Historic Preservation Commission recommended recognition of the stables building as a historic landmark, and the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in October 2004. However, the listing of the building has not led to any cessation of the building's deterioration. Located in the middle of a fenced-off yard used by the City of Pomona for storage of municipal vehicles, fuel, and other materials, the building has fallen into a serious state of disrepair and dilapidation. After the July 2008 Chino Hills earthquake, city officials posted a sign ("pictured at left") on the entrance to the stables restricting access due to its dilapidated condition.

<doc id="19121452" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19121452" title="Football in Peru">
Football in Peru

Football is the most popular sport in Peru. Football in Peru was introduced by British immigrants, Peruvians returning from Great Britain, and by English sailors in the later half of the 19th century during their frequent stops at the port of Callao, which at that point was considered one of the most important ports of the Pacific Ocean. According to the work entitled "La Difusion del Futbol en Lima", during the last decade of the 19th century, records show that sailors were known to practice sports such as football and played against teams made up of Englishmen, Peruvians, or a mix between Englishmen and Peruvians.
Introduction of football in Peru (19th century).
Lima is home to an important sporting institution, it was founded in 1845 by English immigrants as "Salon de Comercio", renamed in 1859 as the "Lima Cricket Club", and was based around the sports of cricket, rugby, and football, the club underwent many other name changes such as in 1865 to "Lima Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club" and in 1906 to "Lima Cricket and Football Club". The oldest football records are found for a "Callao vs. Lima" match on August 7, 1892, and an "Englishmen vs. Peruvian" match on June 24, 1894. During the War of the Pacific, the destruction of various Peruvian towns and cities, including the raid of Lima, brought the spread of sport in Peru to a momentary stop.
Amateur era (Early 20th century).
After the war, the sports rivalry that evolved between the foreigners and the Chalacos began to gain much attention from people elsewhere. As a result, the popularity of the sport eventually extended to Lima, and even though at first the sport was played without the formality of sports clubs, a few clubs were eventually created in order to continue its practice in the early 20th century. Among these early clubs of the amateur era were the English community's Lima Cricket Club founded in 1859 although it is unclear when they first played football, their oldest recorded match having been played on August 7, 1892. They were followed by the Peruvian Ciclista Lima Association (Lima, 1896), and Atlético Chalaco (Callao, 1899).
In the 1900s, due to the construction of the Panama Canal, the port of Callao was no longer flooded with the quantity of foreign sailors and travelers that had at one point made the port a point of much cultural diffusion. Nonetheless, by this moment more Peruvian cities had developed their own football clubs and leagues, the most important being those of Lima, Cusco, and Arequipa. Some of the most important new clubs founded at this time were Alianza Lima (Lima, 1901), Cienciano (Cusco, 1901), FBC Melgar (Arequipa, 1915), the Italian community's Circolo Sportivo Italiano (Lima, 1917), Atlético Grau (Piura, 1919), Alianza Atletico (Sullana, 1920), Universitario de Deportes (Lima, 1924), Sport Boys (Callao, 1927), and Coronel Bolognesi (Tacna, 1929). As such, the sport rapidly grew in Peru, but the most important amateur league (the "Peruvian Football League") stayed in the capital province where a new football rivalry arose between the participating clubs of Lima and the clubs of Callao. Yet, the lack of a central organization often brought much conflict between the teams, and such a situation eventually escalated into a conflict that led to the creation of the Peruvian Football Federation in 1922 and a new Peruvian Football League tournament under the regulation of said organization in 1926.
Professional era and regional recognition (1920s to 1930s).
Even though the Peruvian Football Federation had joined CONMEBOL in 1925, the re-structuring of the national league prevented the creation of a national football team that would be able to participate in the South American Championships of 1925 and the 1926. Moreover, even though in the club level Peru had a series of strong teams, the Peruvian national team created for the 1929 South American Championship was the first successful attempt at a national squad for Peru. This first squad was composed from the best players of the Peruvian Football League, but their first game played against Uruguay (recent winners of the Football Olympics) showed a largely disunited team still trying to mold into a united group effort. The disunity could largely be blamed on class conflict and racial discrimination. The first fielded team was built largely of players from Alianza Lima and Universitario de Deportes, the former being composed of working class men and the later of white university students. Alianza players felt more loyal to their local team than to the national team, and when it became clear that they were being segregated from the rest of the team and left out of the starting IX, they resigned from the national team. What was left of the team played in the South American Cup and lost every match. The Soccer Federation approached the Alianza players again, and offered them reinstatement. Alianza agreed to the federation's terms, and were there for the 1930 World Cup. 
The time that followed saw the appearance of a group of excellent Peruvian football players that would help further expand the popularity of the sport not only in Peru, but also in other countries of South America. During the 1920s and 1930s, Peruvian clubs made a series of international tours due to the high demand of the skill of their players across South America in places such as Colombia, Venezuela, and in Chile. Peru's art of skill and technique of association football was felt and given a highly positive look in these many countries. In Colombia, the appearance of Ciclista Lima Association allegedly made the Colombian crowds "vibrate with excitement" as they anticipated much skill from the Peruvian squad. In 1928, the Peruvian club Atlético Chalaco made a tour in Chile and defeated seven Chilean teams they faced and only lost to Colo-Colo. In 1933 Alianza Lima made a tour in Chile and, with Peruvians such as Teodoro Fernandez and Alejandro Villanueva, delighted the audiences with their skill and defeated a series of important Chilean clubs of that time such as Club Deportivo Magallanes, Santiago Wanderers, Audax Italiano, and Colo-Colo. In Peru, Alejandro Villanueva is often remembered as one of the finest exponents of that nation's association football and as the player that amazed the crowds with his bicycle kicks which the people of Lima at first thought was his invention when he executed it in 1928 and it was called "tiro caracol" and, later, upon learning of its roots in Callao, once again called "chalaca". In 1930, they were invited to participate in a new intercontinental competition to be held in Montevideo, Uruguay, the first FIFA World Cup.
The 1930 FIFA World Cup was an interesting experience for all the teams participating. For the Peruvian team, their first match against the Romania national football team was filled with problems as the Romanians and Peruvians played a rough match that eventually led to a broken leg for one of the Romanian players. This and several other incidents on the field, such as the first minute goal by Romania, soon led to the World Cup's first player dismissed, the Peruvian Plácido Galindo. After all the commotion was settled due to this decision by the referee, Peru was able to momentarily tie the game. Nevertheless, the lack of a player and the inexperience of the national side gave (after two consecutive goals) a pleasing 3-1 result to Romania. Afterwards, in the match against the hosts, Uruguay, that would inaugurate the Estadio Centenario, Peru played an allegedly formidable game against the "Charruas." In fact, Peru lost only by one goal to Uruguay, thus showing a sign of improvement from the past 1929 result against Uruguay (whom would later go on to beat Romania 4-0 and eventually beat Argentina to crown themselves champions of the tournament).
Later, during 1936 Berlin Olympics, the team further showed how much they had improved since 1929. Largely with the squad of the 1930s, but with a new group of young stars, Peru made a great start by defeating the Finland national football team with a margin of 7-3. Even more surprisingly, the Peruvians defied all odds and managed to defeat Austria on a 4-2 result during over-time. Still, the team formally withdrew due to problems with the German government's intervention causing the International Olympic Committee to nullify Peru's victory against Austria and ordering a re-match. Even though the team was already making history, their perseverance would soon lead them to the consolidation of their grandeour. In 1938, Peru's first international title would finally come during the first Bolivarian Games, which Peru won after winning all their games against the football teams of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. Then, further consolidating their status as Peru's first golden generation, the national squad won Peru's first South American Championship (later known as "Copa América") in 1939. Once again, the national squad lost none of its matches and in their path to the finals defeated Ecuador, Chile, and Paraguay. For the final, Peru had to yet again face Uruguay, but this time the team was able to overcome the challenge and defeated Uruguay by a close margin of 2-1. Peruvian player Teodoro Fernández became the tournament's maximum goal scorer with 7 goals, and currently retains the historic second place of the competition. As a result of these many titles, victories, and important showings, the early years of Peru's football history went extraordinarily well, and the team was able to effectively build its game along with the increasing competition of the CONMEBOL region.
Decline and rise (1940s-1960s).
Nonetheless, due to a series of internal problems, Peru's football years after this first golden generation did not involve any other major accomplishments. The 1940s and 1950s flew by with only the achievements of a gold and bronze medal at the Bolivarian Games, and a couple of third places in the Copa América. During the 1960s Peru began to slowly show signs of improvement as the team won the Bolivarian Games of Barranquilla and qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome. Even though the team was only capable of beating the India national football team after losing to France and Hungary, the squad once again began to give its fans bright hopes for the future.
1970s Golden Generation (1970s to 1980s).
Once into the 1970s, the Peruvian "Blanquirrojas" rose with a spark of international victories and a string of young football stars that made the team once more a major competitive force in the world of football. Players like Teófilo Cubillas, Pedro Pablo Leon, Héctor Chumpitaz, Ramon Mifflin, Hugo Sotil, Roberto Challe, and César Cueto, helped make South American football a fierce competitor of European football at a time when teams throughout the world were becoming better at this sport. The participations of Peru in the 1970, 1978, and 1982 FIFA World Cups made the national team once again leave its mark in international competitions as the world saw with awe the elegant and technical play of a Peruvian squad that had a thirst for victory. The participation of Peru in the 1970 FIFA World Cup remains as one of the most memorable as the squad caused sensation as they advanced into the quarterfinals after first eliminating Argentina in the qualifiers, defeating Bulgaria 3-2 after trailing 0-2, losing 3-1 to Germany, and defeating Morocco 3-0. Moreover, their game against Brazil, which they lost 4-2, is usually considered as one of the best World Cup games to have ever been played. Not only that, but in 1975 Peru achieved its second Copa América title, and thus another set of players consolidated their mark in Peruvian sports history. Furthermore, the Peruvian squad once more took the title of football champions at the Bolivarian Games twice during these times. Along with an increase of better teams within the Peruvian league, Peru kept up its game up well into the late 1980s.
Modern history (1990s to present).
Heading towards the 21st century, the 1990s were not very good years for the Peruvian football team. The terrible 1987 Alianza Lima air disaster further crushed the hopes for the team as a series of good players ready to play for the national team died. Although there were still several good players like Julio César Uribe, Nolberto Solano, Claudio Pizarro, and José del Solar, the team was no longer the "Golden Team" of the 70s. In terms of Copa América, the squad could only go as far as the quarterfinals before getting eliminated. Meanwhile, in the World Cup qualifiers, the team was not able to even get close to reaching another FIFA tournament until 1998, but that dream was also twarthed by a goal difference with Chile. The only important title the team won during these years was the Kirin Cup, were they shared first place with Belgium. 
The early 21st century brought with it the same Peruvian team, a shadow of its former self. Nevertheless, the squad began getting new revivals once the team began getting new young players with new hopes and goals. As the years kept going, Peruvian football once more started to give signs of vitality as local teams from the league began doing rather well in international competitions. Yet, the results were still vastly the same for the Peruvian team in terms of both the Copa América and the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. Quite surprisingly, Peru was able to do well when they were invited to participate in the CONCACAF Gold Cup and even won another Kirin Cup in 2005. Meanwhile, in 2007, the football fans of Peru received another great surprise as the national U-17 squad qualified and reached the quarterfinals (for their first time) of their FIFA World Cup. With young star players like Jefferson Farfán and José Paolo Guerrero had given new hopes to fans that things would turn around for the better.
Nonetheless the possibilities of Peru securing a CONMEBOL place for the 2010 FIFA World Cup have completely vanished since the team has tumbled to the bottom of the qualification table.

Got to Have Faith

"Got to Have Faith" is a 2004 single released by the Swedish heavy metal band Europe. It was released on September 15, 2004, and was the first single from the album "Start from the Dark".
"Got to Have Faith" was co-written by vocalist Joey Tempest and guitarist John Norum, and was the first song written for "Start from the Dark". "We wanted to make something modern, heavy and something that would be relevant now," Tempest said, "So John sent me some riffs to my hometown in London and I just started putting things together, writing lyrics and when I felt I had something, I sent it off to the other guys. They were all like, 'This is great!'... Hence the heavier riffs, the D-tuning and everything because that's the way John likes to do it."
The song's music video features the band performing in a garage interspersed with clips taken from the "Ghost Rider" motorcycle stunt films. In an interlude, the video shows brief, distorted clips of the band taken from the 1980s. Ghost Rider, touching speeds over , zooms past Upplands Väsby, the Swedish suburb where the band was formed, at the end of the video.

Walt Monegan

Walter Carleton "Walt" Monegan III (born May 1951) is the former Police Chief of Anchorage, Alaska, and later Commissioner of Public Safety for the state of Alaska. His dismissal in July 2008 by Alaska governor Sarah Palin drew considerable attention, particularly in the wake of Palin's selection as the Vice-Presidential nominee of the Republican Party the following month. Monegan accused Palin of not telling the truth about the reasons for his dismissal.
Early life.
Walter Carleton Monegan III was born in Seattle, Washington in May 1951, the son of Elizabeth (née Clark) and Walter Carleton Monegan, Jr.. Monegan never knew his father, who died heroically in the Korean War on September 20, 1950 at age 19. The elder Monegan would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
Monegan grew up in the small village of Nyac, between Aniak and Bethel in rural Southwest Alaska. Monegan has described himself as part Irish and part Alaska Native, with combined Tlingit and Yupik ancestry. He attended Alaska Methodist University for a year, and then joined the Marine Corps in 1970.
Highlights of police career.
The Anchorage Police Department hired him as a patrolman in January 1974. Monegan worked in every division of the Anchorage Police Department, including Internal Affairs, Crime Prevention, Communications, and Detectives. He also attended the Traffic Institute at Northwestern University, as well as the National Crime Prevention Institute at the University of Louisville, and he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in organizational administration from Alaska Pacific University.
In February 2001, Monegan was appointed Chief of Police by Anchorage Mayor George Wuerch. He served in that position until 2006. Later that year, Governor Sarah Palin appointed him Public Safety Commissioner. He held the latter position until his dismissal on July 11, 2008.
Personal life.
Monegan is married to Terryene Mihara. They have four adult children from previous marriages and reside in the Anchorage suburb of Chugiak. Monegan's first wife was Georgene Moldovan.
Public Safety Commissioner dismissal.
Governor Palin's Chief of Staff, Mike Nizich dismissed Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan on July 11, 2008 for the reason (according to Palin's spokesperson Sharon Leighow) that "the governor wanted to take DPS in a different direction" Nizich then offered Monegan the job as director of the ABC Board which he turned down. Anchorage blogger Andrew Halcro broke the story that Monegan was fired due to his refusal to fire the governor's ex-brother-in-law a week later. Monegan said that he had resisted persistent pressure from the Governor, her husband, and her staff, including State Attorney General Talis Colberg, to fire Palin’s ex-brother-in-law, state trooper Mike Wooten; Wooten was involved in a child custody battle with Palin’s sister that included an alleged death threat against Palin's father. Monegan stated he learned an internal investigation had found all but two of the allegations to be unsubstantiated, and Wooten had been disciplined for the others three years prior. He told the Palins that there was nothing he could do because the matter was closed and Trooper Wooten had already been disciplined. When contacted by the press for comment, Monegan first acknowledged pressure to fire Wooten but said that he could not be certain that his own firing was connected to that issue; but as the governor's story changed, he came to believe that the dispute over Wooten was a major reason for his firing. Subsequent to Palin's VP pick, the McCain campaign claimed Monegan was fired for insubordination and called him a "rogue" but gave no explanation why Monegan had been offered the job of Director of the ABC Board if that were the case.
Finding of investigations.
On October 10, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release, without officially endorsing, the Branchflower Report in which Stephen Branchflower found that "Governor Sarah Palin abused her power as Governor ... Walt Monegan's refusal to fire Trooper Michael Wooten ... was likely a contributing factor to his termination as Commissioner of Public Safety."
On 6 February 2009 the Alaska State Senate found ten Palin administration officials, together with Todd Palin, in contempt for refusing to attend hearings in the Branchflower investigation to which they had been subpoenaed. Three days later, Talis Colberg resigned his position as Attorney-General and left the State's employ.
The Associated Press reported on November 3, 2008 that an independent investigation subsequently conducted by the Alaska Personnel Board cleared Governor Palin of any abuse of power. The Personnel Board's three members were first appointed by Palin’s predecessor, and Palin reappointed one member in 2008.

Hodoscope

A hodoscope (from the Greek "hodos" for way or path, and "skopos:" an observer) is an instrument used in particle physics experiments to detect passing charged particles and determine their trajectories. Hodoscopes are characterized by being made up of many segments; the combination of which segments record a detection is then used to infer where the particle passed through hodoscope.
The typical detector segment is a piece of scintillating material, which emits light when a particle passes through it. The scintillation light can be converted to an electrical signal either by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a PIN diode. If a segment measures some significant amount of light, the experimenter can infer that a particle passed through that segment. In addition to coordinate information, for some systems the strength of the light can be proportional to the deposited energy. By doing necessary calibrations, the deposited energy can be determined, which then can be used to infer
information about the original particle's energy.
As an example: a simple hodoscope might be used to determine where a particle crossed a plane or a wall. In this case, the experimenter could use two segments shaped like strips, arranged in two layers. One layer of strips could be arranged horizontally, while a second layer could be arranged vertically. A particle passing through the wall would hit a strip in each layer; the vertical strip would reveal the particle's horizontal position when it crossed the wall, while the horizontal strip would indicate the particle's vertical position.
Hodoscopes are some of the simplest detectors for tracking charged particles. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the segment size. In applications where the spatial resolution is very important, hodoscopes have been superseded by other detectors such as drift chambers and time projection chambers.

2008 Women's EuroFloorball Cup Finals

The 2008 Women's EuroFloorball Cup Finals took place in Winterthur, Switzerland from 8 to 12 October 2008.
The 2008 EuroFloorball Cup marks the second year in which the new name for the tournament was used (previously known as the European Cup). The tournament also marks its 16th year.
The IFF decided that the tournament will revert to its original format, and will take place during one calendar year, instead of two.
Qualification Format.
Since the top 4 nations at the 2007–08 Women's EuroFloorball Cup were from Switzerland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Norway, the top team in that country automatically qualifies, as well as the reigning champion. 5 teams in total receive automatic qualification.
Since 5 of the 8 spots are filled, the other 3 need to be decided using regional qualification. In Group C, the runners-up to the top team in Switzerland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Norway play for a spot in the finals. In Groups A and B, the teams are split into regions: West Europe and East Europe, respectively. The winning team in each group advances to the finals, making the total number of teams eight.
To be eligible to take part in the 2008 Women's EuroFloorball Cup, teams that take place in regional qualification must capture the national title in floorball in their country. If that team does not register, then the second-place team can register, and so forth.
Qualifying Venues.
Group A qualifications for Western Europe took place in Frederikshavn, Denmark from 14 to 16 August 2008
Group B qualifications for Eastern Europe took place in Bratislava, Slovakia from 27 to 31 August 2008.
Group C qualifications took place in Helsinki, Finland from 22 to 24 August 2008.

Operation Medina

Operation Medina was a search and destroy operation conducted in the Hai Lang Forest Reserve of South Vietnam in the autumn of 1967 during the Vietnam War. Conducted by the First and Second battalions of the First Marine Regiment, the First Battalion of the Third Marine Regiment, and two battalions of the First ARVN Division, the objective of the operation was to locate and annihilate any North Vietnamese (NVA) forces found in the forest reserve. 
One specific enemy base that the Marines sought to eliminate was known as Base Area 101. Base Area 101 was an NVA staging area, a place where the NVA felt safe enough to build up personnel and supplies. The base was a launching point for attacks by the Fifth and Sixth NVA Regiments against the possible Marine bases at Con Thien, Khe Sahn, Dong Ha and Phu Bai. 
Operation Medina began on 10 October 1967 and ended on 20 October. The operation obtained partial success. Even though the NVA were not driven out of the Hai Lang Forest Reserve, significant losses were inflicted upon them by the Marine and ARVN forces.
The Marines and Navy Corpsmen of Charlie Company 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division are the subject of "Lions of Medina", an award winning and critically acclaimed book by historian Doyle Glass.

César-Pierre Richelet (8 November 1626 – 23 November 1698) was a French grammarian and lexicographer, the editor of the first dictionary of the French language.
Life.
Richelet was born in Cheminon. His first position was regent of the College of Vitry-le-François, next preceptor in Dijon. Received as an advocate in service to the Parliament of Paris, he abandoned his affairs for literature and researched the Society of Perrot d’Ablancourt and that of Petru. He strengthened his knowledge of classical languages and learned Italian and Spanish and applied himself above all to discovering the origins of the French language. He died in Paris.
Works.
He is the author of the first French dictionary compiled in a methodical way, published under the title of:
His caustic sense of humour earned him enemies; this first edition, of which there were several counterfeit foreign editions, contains satirical passages at the expense of notables of the day including Amelot de La Houssaye, Furetière, Varillas, and others.
Later editions of Richelet were published, both expurgated and augmented. Those that appeared after his death are distinguished by that of Pierre Aubert (Lyon, 1728, 3 vol. in-fol.) and that of Goujet (Ibid., 1759–63, 3 vol. in-fol.).

Sorani Kurdish grammar.
Sorani.
Sorani Kurdish is written with the Arabic alphabet, it has 8 vowels:îû[u, iu[ʊ, eo[o, a[æ], â[ɑ].
Nouns.
A Kurdish noun in the absolute state,
i.e. without any ending of any kind, gives a generic sense of the noun. It is
also the “lexical” form of the noun, i.e. the form in which a noun is given in
a vocabulary list or dictionary. The absolute state is normally used for the
generic sense, as in "قاوه رهشه" "qâwa rasha"(coffee is black).
Tense.
The main tenses
The Past Perfect Tense (Intransitive).
For intransitive verbs with past stems ending in a consonant (like hatin > hat-), the past perfect tense,which is functionally equivalent to the English past perfect (‘I had come,you had gone’), is formed from the past stem + i + the past tense of bûn ‘to be.’ Verbs with past stems ending in a vowel (like bûn > bû) form the past perfect tense from the simple stem + the past tense of bûn.

2008 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11

These are the individual stages of the 2008 Vuelta a España, with Stage 1 on 30 August and Stage 11 on 10 September.
Stages.
Stage 1.
30 August 2008 – Granada, 7 km (TTT)
The 2008 Vuelta began with a short team time trial over a perfectly flat course in the city of Granada.
The Italian team was the unexpected winner of the team time trial. They finished in 8' 21", more than ten seconds clear of the supposed favorites and . also finished well; the Basques were eight seconds back of Liquigas at the end, for second place, despite having the best time at the intermediate time check. Filippo Pozzato donned the first golden jersey at the head of the General classification.
Stage 2.
31 August 2008 – Granada to Jaén, 167 km 
The first regular stage of the Vuelta included its first climb, the third category hill at Las Encebras, and featured a 25 kilometer circuit in the city of Jaén before the finish. The cyclists took two laps of this circuit before the final finishing line. It was thought that it would ensure a sprint finish.
Just as he had in the Tour de France earlier in the season, Alejandro Valverde won the first regular stage of the Vuelta. The successful breakaway of the day involved Jesús Rosendo, Egoi Martínez, Cyril Lemoine, and Mikhail Ignatiev. They held a maximum advantage of 4' 30" on the main field, but were caught 20 kilometers before the finish. Valverde's Caisse d'Epargne teammates successfully cracked the main field on the way into Jaén, launching attacks that kept anyone but Valverde going clear, as he did, with a 2 second advantage on the field. Thanks to that and time bonuses at the line, Valverde took the overall lead in the race.
Stage 3.
1 September 2008 – Jaén to Córdoba, 168 km 
This stage was gently undulating until the third category climb up San Jerónimo, which began 26 kilometers from the finish line. It was thought that this might break up the field and keep a mass sprint from happening, which partially came true.
Andalucía-Cajasur rider Manuel Ortega broke away from the main field almost immediately after the official start of the stage. Alone, he held a maximum advantage of over 15 minutes before the pack, paced by the race leader's team Caisse d'Epargne, began to draw him back. Their pace was extremely lax, slower than the slowest predicted team by the Vuelta's organizers, but eventually they did begin to reel Ortega in. Liquigas later came forward to set a faster pace, one that cracked about a third of the field on the way up the Alto de San Jerónimo climb. A breakaway led by Paolo Bettini caught Ortega with 17 kilometers to go, but Bettini's breakaway itself was caught 4 kilometers in front of the line. A bunched sprint saw Tom Boonen win the stage. With bonus seconds won for second place at the line and in intermediate sprints, Daniele Bennati became the third golden jersey wearer in as many days.
Stage 4.
2 September 2008 – Córdoba to Puertollano, 170 km 
This stage saw the riders leave the autonomous community of Andalusia and enter Castile-La Mancha. There were two third-category climbs along the way, but the final 60 kilometers were almost perfectly flat, and a bunched sprint finish was expected.
An Andalucía-Cajasur rider again launched a solo attack that kept him out in front of the field for most of the day. For this stage, that rider was José Antonio López, who broke away at the 9 kilometer mark and attained a maximum advantage of 8' 06" as the bunch took it easy for the first two and a half hours before finally increasing their speed. The field was paced by the race leader's team Liquigas as well as the team of the man who won the stage the previous day and poised to do so again, Tom Boonen's Quick Step mates. López held on as long as he could, and was caught at the 8 kilometers to go mark. Another classic sprint finish saw the stage victory go to race leader Daniele Bennati. A crash at the 3 kilometers to go mark fractured the field and limited the riders who could contest the finish to those already at the front of the pack. While a crash within the final 3 kilometers normally affords everyone involved the same finishing time as the one attained by the group they were in upon crashing, race officials later declared that this crash took place just outside 3 kilometers from the line, and all time lost by those involved would stand as time lost.
Stage 5.
3 September 2008 – Ciudad Real, 42 km (ITT)
The first individual time trial of the Vuelta took place on a completely flat course in Ciudad Real. It was predicted that the winner would have an average of speed of over 50 km/h.
The early time to beat was set by Manuel Quinziato of Liquigas, blowing away the times that had come before him by more than a minute. Around an hour after Quinziato's ride, a pack of General classification favorites took the course, and the first of them, Astana's Levi Leipheimer, clocked in 33 seconds better than Quinziato, and held on to win the stage as well as the next golden jersey. The only other man to beat Quinziato on the day was something of a surprise, Sylvain Chavanel of Cofidis, who is not normally known, in international competition, for his time trialling skills. The other contenders all turned in strong rides, leaving the GC tightly bunched with the Pyrenees looming.
Stage 6.
4 September 2008 – Ciudad Real to Toledo, 150 km
In what was the last stage branded as flat before the Vuelta entered the mountains, there was one third-category climb 50 kilometers before the finish. After that peak, there was a sharp descent and a flat section with two intermediate sprints before the altitude dropped again in the city of Toledo. The finish was on a slight uphill, which was thought to test the sprinters' limits in what was expected nonetheless to be a mass finish.
The day's successful breakaway formed after about 7 kilometers, involving Iban Mayoz, Mikhail Ignatiev, and Volodymyr Dyudya. The team that paced the pack in efforts to bring them back was Cofidis, looking to have one solid group at the intermediate sprints later in the course so Sylvain Chavanel could make up the 2 second gap he had to race leader Levi Leipheimer. There was a big crash in the pack at the 68 kilometer mark, mostly involving riders from Silence-Lotto, Quick Step, Xacobeo-Galicia, and Bouygues Télécom, as well as Alejandro Valverde and Tom Boonen, who later called on the race doctor for some medical attention. The Cofidis-paced main field caught the break at the 108 kilometer mark, just after the one categorized climb of the day and just before the intermediate sprints. Shortly afterward, the blistering pace set by Cofidis, along with some crosswinds, led to another crash, at the 112 kilometer mark. Chavanel won the two intermediate sprints and became the new overall leader of the Vuelta on the road, thanks to the twelve bonus seconds he won with them. Numerous riders attacked on the way into Toledo and a pack led by Paolo Bettini, who won the sprint to the line, was the successful one. The field in fact fractured quite a bit - there were six large groups separated, collectively, by less than a minute at the end of the stage.
Rest day.
5 September 2008
Stage 7.
6 September 2008 – Barbastro to Naturlandia-La Rabassa (Andorra), 223 km
The longest stage of the 2008 Vuelta, as well as one of the most mountainous, the first action after the rest day was a stern test for the riders. There were four categorized climbs along the way, one each in the first, second, and third categories with a special category climb at the finish in Andorra making this stage a playground for riders who like to battle gravity.
This day belonged to Alessandro Ballan. He was part of a five-man group, along with Marc de Maar, Iñigo Landaluze, Gianni Meersman, and Xabier Zandio, that broke away at the 18 kilometer mark, and stayed out in front of the field all day to claim the stage win. He had other prizes awaiting him at the podium in Andorra, namely the golden jersey (giving the Vuelta its sixth different overall leader in seven stages), the red jersey, and the white jersey. He was also only 7 points shy of claiming the blue jersey. The route was marked by terrible weather, in particular rain and cold temperatures, which Ballan would later say helped him win, in that he is accustomed to such weather living in northern Italy.
The lead Ballan's breakaway had over the pack grew to a maximum of just under eleven minutes before Astana, the team of GC hopefuls Levi Leipheimer and Alberto Contador, took the pace of the main field to try to reel them in. Their pace was so blisteringly fast that it cracked more than two-thirds of the field, members of which dropped as much as thirty minutes behind them. When Astana ratcheted up its speed, the breakaway did as well, as Zandio was dropped, falling minutes behind them. Ballan attacked from his group and got free at the 14 kilometers to go mark and quickly attained a lead of two minutes over the other three, staying out front to win the stage. The elite main group led by Astana caught the other members of the day's breakaway, and attacked and jockeyed for position at the finish some three minutes behind Ballan.
Stage 8.
7 September 2008 – Escaldes-Engordany (Andorra) to Plá de Beret, 151 km
This short, yet extremely mountainous, stage was thought to invite many early attacks, as the race re-entered Spain. There were three first category climbs on the course, and the finish was on a slight downhill after the Alto de Plá de Beret. This stage also featured the highest point in the 2008 Vuelta, the first-category Port de la Bonaigua, at 2,070 meters in elevation.
Many riders attempted to break away from the pack from the outset, but no one was successful until an hour had been spent in the saddle and 38 kilometers covered. The five that broke free were Christophe Kern, Nikita Eskov, Juan Manuel Gárate, Sébastien Joly, and David Moncoutié. Their lead quickly rose to three minutes as Garate was the first over the first-category climb El Cantó. It held steady until the category two climb up Eviny 27 kilometers later, and then grew to a maximum of 5' 30" before Astana, again, was the team to come forward to pace the main field. Astana's sporting director Johan Bruyneel explained that this was more to keep things steady, after the race leader's team Lampre dropped off the pace, than to bring the breakaway back, since no one in it was a GC threat.
The autobus formed going up the Puerto de la Bonaigua as Andreas Klöden set an extremely fast pace. Among the many riders to fall into the autobus was race leader Alessandro Ballan. In short order, Levi Leipheimer effectively became the new race leader on the road, as Ballan dropped well back of the main field, which caught every breakaway rider except Moncoutié before the summit of the Bonaigua. Though his advantage continued to shrink, Moncoutié managed to stay out front just long enough to win the stage, with the main chase group, an elite bunch of a dozen or so riders who were able to take Klöden's pace, 34 seconds back. Alejandro Valverde and Alberto Contador traded repeated attacks on the way up to Plá de Beret, gaining themselves as well as Igor Antón five potentially valuable seconds over other contenders such as Leipheimer, Carlos Sastre, and Ezequiel Mosquera. Valverde and Contador went on to don leader's jerseys after the stage, Valverde the blue points jersey and Contador the white combined classification jersey.
Stage 9.
8 September 2008 – Vielha e Mijaran to Sabiñánigo, 200 km
This stage was thought to see a winning breakaway, and did. There were four categorized climbs along the way, including the first-category Puerto de Serrablo 66 kilometers before the finish, to keep the teams of the sprinters from taking control of the race.
Being faced almost immediately with the second-category Alto del Túnel and, not long after, the second-category Coll de l'Espina, no breakaway came successfully clear of the bunch for over an hour. When David Moncoutié topped l'Espina in first position, he took over the King of the Mountains lead from Alessandro Ballan. He later cemented this by topping the Puerto de Serrablo in first place as well.
The race leader's team Astana again set a very fast pace at the head of the main field, such that it fractured into three large groups, with all the major GC contenders in the first group. Finally, after 60 kilometers and close to two hours in the saddle, a 12-man group broke free, attaining an advantage of close to seven minutes. The best-placed man in the breakaway, Euskaltel-Euskadi rider Egoi Martínez, threatened the overall lead of Levi Leipheimer as he was 6' 41" back at the beginning of the day. Team CSC Saxo Bank and Caisse d'Epargne tried to pull the main field along fast enough so that the time gap to the breakaway would be small enough that Leipheimer's Astana Team would have to work to keep him in gold, but the strategy didn't work. Astana eventually retook the pace and willfully let the time gap go low enough so that when all was done at the day's end, Martínez had taken enough time back to become the new holder of the golden jersey. This move was criticized the next day by several local newspapers.
Eleven of the riders in the breakaway finished in Sabiñánigo together, and the sprint to the line was won by Silence-Lotto rider Greg Van Avermaet. The main field, which had consolidated to almost all other riders in the race, finished 6' 42" back (Martínez also gained bonus seconds in intermediate sprints, leading to his 11 second lead in the GC after this stage).
Stage 10.
9 September 2008 – Sabiñánigo to Zaragoza, 151 km
After the climb up and descent from the second-category Puerto de Monrepós after just 34 kilometers, this stage was almost completely flat and saw a mass sprint finish. The finishing city of Zaragoza is a traditional one in the Vuelta, having hosted stage finishes on 47 occasions. The wind that the city is known for was thought to wreak some havoc on the sprinters.
This was a rather straightforward day of racing. There were a few breakaway attempts in the first hour, but none succeeded. The breakaway that did succeed involved a single rider, Milram's Matej Jurčo, who the Euskaltel team let free after 37 kilometers. His maximum advantage grew to 7' 20" before Quick Step and Rabobank, working for Tom Boonen and Óscar Freire, respectively, pulled the bunch ahead to bring him back and ensure a mass sprint finish. Jurčo took both intermediate sprints, and was briefly joined in his effort by José Antonio López as the main field neared him, but the pack became one again with 8 kilometers to the line. The bunched sprint was won by Sébastien Hinault, and the GC was unchanged by the day's results.
Stage 11.
10 September 2008 – Calahorra to Burgos, 178 km
This was branded as a transitional stage, undulating for the 78 kilometers before a gradual increase in elevation that became more steep at the 138 kilometer mark at the third-category Alto de Valmala. After a plateau there, the finish into Burgos was on a lengthy, but slight, downhill.
This, again, was a very normal day of racing. Three riders, Serafín Martínez, Jose Antonio López, and Andriy Hryvko escaped the bunch after 35 kilometers and precisely one hour in the saddle. Their maximum advantage was 7 minutes, but the main field didn't have much trouble reeling them in, which they did 7 kilometers from the line. The majority of the field was together for a bunched sprint finish, which was won by Óscar Freire. The GC was again unchanged by the day's results.

Skytone Alpha-400

The Skytone Alpha-400 is a Linux-based low-cost netbook with a 7 in 800×480 LCD screen. Its measurements (length×width×depth) are 210×140×32 mm and it weighs 0.65 kg.
It is made in China by Skytone and Exon International Technology Co Ltd, with the former providing the GNU/Linux software and the latter producing the hardware. It uses a Chinese Ingenic Jz4730 336 MHz MIPSII-compatible one core 32-bit system-on-a-chip (SoC) with 128 MiB of SDRAM, and a 1–2 GB solid state drive.
The Skytone Alpha-400 was designed with low cost and child-friendliness in mind, some versions being sold for as little as $130 retail. There is an option to swap the standard theme with a children's theme. It also comes with applications geared toward children, and a Flash player to play animated children's songs. The Flash player is not built into the browser, so Flash-dependent sites such as YouTube will not work, but a standalone Flash player is available to run .swf files and can be used to play Flash based games, and such.
Alternative names.
The Skytone Alpha is often marketed, sometimes in slightly altered form, under many different brand names.
Here is a (probably incomplete) list of variants;
Features.
The Skytone Alpha-400 uses a customized version of Linux, based on a 2.4.x kernel, with a user-friendly interface optimized for children.
The Linux desktop is implemented as Kiosk software, meaning that nothing the user can do can modify the available applications, and no new applications can be (easily) added or removed. 
Browsing can be done through the use of the built in browser called "Bon Echo", an Alpha release of Mozilla Firefox 2, using the built-in 10/100 BASE-T Ethernet port, or the integrated 802.11 Wireless LAN, but the browser does not support Flash, meaning that Flash intensive tools, such as YouTube, cannot be used. However, recently Exon, the original design manufacturer of most of these devices, announced full support for YouTube and most Flash enabled websites.
The device sports three USB ports, a small but fully functioning keyboard, a touchpad, stereo speakers, and a 2 cell 2.1 Ah battery.
The Skytone Alpha's processor uses as little as 0.2 W of power, and does not have a heat sink, and thus no ventilation openings. Some versions have extra features like a VGA video port, or a USB On-The-Go port.
Available distributions.
So far all distributions for this device use the 2.4.20-celf3 kernel. The kernel itself is not on the root file system itself and gets loaded by u-boot.
Other similar devices by Exon/Skytone.
The successor of the device, the "Alpha 400P", comes with a 416 MHz XScale, fifth generation ARM architecture, SoC (likely a Marvell PXA27x), USB 2.0 and up to 256 MiB of DDR2 memory. Another similar device comes with the 248 MHz ARM SoC AK7802Q216, 64/128 MiB of DDR RAM and Windows CE 5.0.
Skytone announced another device called "Alpha 680" running Android that features a 533 MHz Jade Tech Z228 ARM CPU. The Alpha-680 has a rotatable touchscreen that can be turned and flipped over, so that the unit becomes a tablet computer.
Another similar machine produced by Exon, but not sold by Skytone, comes with an x86 legacy compatible 800 MHz DM&P PDX-600 SoC CPU and is thus able to run Windows XP.
It uses a XGI Volari Z9s GPU without 3D acceleration. As it is usually sold with Windows XP preinstalled, its default configuration has 512 MiB DDR2 SDRAM and 4/8 GB flash. It is also available with a built-in 0.3 Mpixel camera. This version was first presented at CES 2009.

Cogon, Tagbilaran

Barangay Cogon is one of the biggest barangays in the city of Tagbilaran, in the province of Bohol, Philippines. Located centrally in the city, Cogon overlooks Tagbilaran Bay to the west, to the south, it is bounded by Poblacion 2, to the east by Barangay Dampas and Dao and to the north by Barangay Booy. It has a plain and rolling land terrain. The highest point of elevation is only 180 feet above sea level.
The total land area is 204.4508 hectares, with a population in 2007 of 17,266, the most in the city. It is generally believed that more than one-half of its present population are no longer native Cogonhanons.
History.
Many years ago, the place was a vast plain of land with few houses, two roads and a little vegetation including the balite tree and Cogon grass. At that time, the grass was useful to people as the leaves were used for roofing their houses. Once a Spaniard asked a native what the name of the place was. The native did not understand Spanish and believed he was asking what the grass was called, so the owner of the hut answered "Cogon". This became widespread as the local place name.
Profile.
Political Subdivision.
The barangay is divided into Lower and Upper Cogon. With the Pres. Carlos P. Garcia Avenue as boundary line, Lower Cogon, which is on the west, is flat and plain. It is conducive to commercial establishments as well as residential purposes. Upper Cogon, which is on the east part, is a rolling land.
There are eight puroks with 122 clusters or units in the barangay manned by the elected kagawads including the Punong Barangay.
Economy.
There are tourist facilities located in the barangay such as Bohol Tropics Resort Club, Hotel La Roca and Coralandia Resorts. The Tagbilaran Tourist Port and Tagbilaran Airport, main gateways for inbound tourist traffic, is also geographically located in the barangay. Two health centers and one tertiary private hospital caters to the needs of the people. A shopping center, Plaza Marcela, and other commercial establishments are also situated in Cogon.
Church.
The Birhen sa Barangay Parish Shrine or "Cogon Shrine" for short, is also often called "Simbahang Lingin" (Round Church) by parishioners and residents. The church is located near the Airport, along Benigno Aquino Jr. Avenue, Cogon, Tagbilaran City. The Parish is being led by its Parish Priest, Msgr. Vicente "Boy" Nunag III.

Joseph Leckie

Joseph Alexander Leckie (24 May 1866 – 9 August 1938) was a British Liberal, later Liberal National politician and leather manufacturer.
Education and business life.
Leckie was born in Govan in Glasgow the son of John and Isabella Leckie. He was educated at Glasgow Academy and Bellahouston Academy, Glasgow. Leckie joined his father’s wholesale saddlery and leather goods manufacturing business, which had branches in Glasgow, London and Walsall. He travelled widely on the company’s business in Europe, Canada, the USA and Central America. He continued to work for the company until 1928. During this time he was a member and sometime president of Walsall Incorporated Chamber of Commerce. Leckie later became a member of the Council of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the British Empire. He married Jean Wightman, the daughter of a Walsall Justice of the Peace.
Public life.
Like most late Victorian businessmen, Leckie took an interest in public affairs. As early as 1898 he was chosen as Hon. Secretary to the Walsall Victoria Nursing Institution and he took an active part in temperance, social and religious works. Presumably reflecting his Glasgow roots, Leckie was a Presbyterian. He served as president of the West Midland Federation of Free Churches and treasurer of the Federal Council of the Free Churches. He also served as president of the Walsall and District Band of Hope Union for some years. He was a Chairman of the Walsall Chamber of Commerce in the early years of the 20th century.
Local Politics.
Leckie first stood for election to Walsall Council in the Bridge Ward in 1903, describing himself as a Progressive Candidate. However he was beaten by a local solicitor.
This was only a temporary setback however, for in 1905 Leckie became a member of the Walsall Education Committee and he was Chairman of the Committee from 1930-37. He became a member of Walsall Town Council in 1916. Elections to the council were suspended because of the First World War and when in April 1916 a sitting councillor in Hatherton Ward resigned to devote more time to his business, Leckie was proposed for co-option and chosen over a candidate put forward by the Labour Party and Trades Council. He retained his seat comfortably at the municipal elections of 1919 and went on to a distinguished local government career. He was later an alderman of what was by then the County Borough of Walsall from 1930 until 1937. He was Mayor of Walsall in 1926-27. In 1933 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the Association of Education Committees. In 1937 he was made an honorary freeman of Walsall. He also served as a Justice of the Peace.
Parliament.
Leckie was Chairman of Walsall Liberal Association from 1912-1931 and in 1931 he was chosen to be Liberal candidate for Walsall at the general election. This was the election following the formation of the National Government under Ramsay MacDonald. An agreement was made with the Conservatives, and Leckie got a free run against the sitting Labour Member of Parliament (MP) John McShane. When the Liberal Party withdrew from the National Government after the general election and divided into those who supported the coalition and those against, Leckie stayed with the National Liberal group led by Sir John Simon. He stood as a Liberal National again at the 1935 general election and was returned with a majority of 8,969 votes. The by-election in Walsall which followed Leckie’s death resulted in a win for the Liberal National (government) candidate Sir George Schuster.
Death.
Leckie, who had suffered from increasing deafness as he grew older, died following a seizure on 9 August 1938 at a nursing home in Edgbaston, Birmingham.

Darren Barker

Darren Barker is a retired English middleweight boxer. He is a former holder of the British and European middleweight titles and a former holder of the Commonwealth title. As an amateur he won gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Barker defeated Australian Daniel Geale via a points decision in Atlantic City to become the IBF world middleweight champion on 17 August 2013, losing it in his first defence to Felix Sturm on 7 December.
Amateur career.
Barker started his boxing career at a young age, he trained at Finchley and District Amateur Boxing club in New Barnet where he was trained by Jimmy Oliver (father of former European Champion Spencer Oliver) amongst others. After a successful and long period at the club, Barker decided to move on to further his boxing skills and begun training at the Repton Boys Club in Bethnal Green, there he was trained by the highly regarded boxing coach, Tony Burns. Darren's father, Terry, was also a successful amateur boxer at Repton, winning the ABA Championships in 1981. In 2002 Barker won the Commonwealth Games Gold medal at the championships held in Manchester. He also became a Multi nations Champion and Class C NABC Champion. Prior to the decision to turn professional Barker's amateur record stood at 68 fights, 55 wins and 13 losses.
Professional career.
Barker's first outing as a professional took place on 24 September 2004 with a fight at the Ice Arena in Nottingham defeating journeyman Howard Clarke. He next fought on 12 November 2004 at the Conference center in Wembley stopping David White in the 2nd round ensuring that his debut year as a professional was an unbeaten one.
Throughout 2005 Barker fought on five more occasions winning each time and then kept busy in 2006 with another seven contests winning all of them. One notable contest during that year took place on 15 September 2006 and was for the Southern Area Middleweight title with Barker beating Hussein Osman at the Alexandra Palace in Wood Green. Other notable victories that year included wins over Danny Thornton in May and Paul Samuels in December. A successful start to his career was then violently curtailed when on 10 December 2006 Barker received the news that his brother Gary, also a boxer, had been killed in a car accident. Following the accident Darren decided to take a break from boxing eventually returning to the ring on 5 October 2007 with a win over Greg Barton at the York Hall.
Commonwealth champion.
On 14 November 2007 Barker fought for his first major title, the vacant Commonwealth Middleweight belt. His opponent, the undefeated Australian Ben Crampton had won 20 fights to date with only one draw. Barker won the fight at the York Hall by unanimous decision over 12 rounds to lift the title. His first defence saw him beat former British & European title challenger Steve Bendall with a seventh round stoppage. Barker then travelled to Canada in August 2008 and beat local man Larry Sharpe, a former Canadian champion and Commonwealth challenger, in a non-title fight over 10 rounds. On 13 December 2008, Barker defended his title for the second time against Northern Ireland's Jason McKay forcing him to retire at the end of round six. Barker's third defence of the title took place on 23 May 2009 against Dudley's Darren McDermott in a fight which was also billed as a British title eliminator. The fight which was held at the Watford Colosseum ended with a fourth round stoppage for the champion.
British champion.
On 28 November 2009 Barker defeated Danny Butler, at the Brentwood Centre in Brentwood to lift the vacant British Middleweight title with the fight also doubling as a fourth defence of his Commonwealth crown. The original opponent for the fight Wayne Elcock, a former champion, had withdrawn due to a stomach virus meaning that Butler had come into the contest at short notice. Barker's class showed, and the referee called a stop to the fight in round 7 deciding that Butler, who had recently lost to Darren McDermott in a challenge for the English title, was in no position to continue.
European champion.
On 9 April 2010 Barker claimed the European title with a unanimous points victory over Affif Belghecham of France. The shot at the European belt was unexpected following the surprise vacating of the title by previous holder Matthew Macklin who had hopes of pursuing World title ambitions. The fight against Belghecham, the reigning French and EU champion, proved to be the toughest of his career so far with the Frenchman pushing Barker all the way. Barker, now the holder of three championship belts, decided to vacate the Commonwealth title and set his sights upon defending the British and European belts against Matthew Macklin, whose world title ambitions did not materialise, later in the year in an eagerly anticipated fight dubbed the 'Battle of Britain'. The fight was to be one of the showcases of Frank Warrens 'Magnificent Seven' boxing event to be shown live on SKY PPV on 18 September 2010. The fight however had to be called off following the re-occurrence of a hip injury whilst sparring for the contest meaning that Barker had to pull out of the contest and relinquish the title. Barkers trainer Tony Sims said of the decision to pull him out of the fight ""Everyone knows he had a hip operation a few months back and the day before yesterday (31 August 2010) he broke down for a second time. A few weeks ago is when it first happened I gave him five days off, but it went again this week midway through when he was sparring Danny Cadman...He asked for a few more days off but how long do you keep doing that for?."" Barker's would be opponent Matthew Macklin eventually won the now vacant title fight following a 6th round win over Georgia's late replacement Shalva Jomardashvili.
Two time champion.
On 1 May 2011 Barker regained the now vacant European middleweight title with a points win over Italy's Domenico Spada at the Olympia in London after over 12 months away from the ring. The Londoner was declared the winner after the judges scored the contest 115–113 and 116–113 after 12 rounds. Prior to the fight Barker spoke of his excitement at returning to the ring following his hip injury saying "I'm really excited about it and eager to show the general public what I'm made of" he added "training has gone well. been out for a year now, and I'm really looking forward to getting back in there." The fight also represented Barker's first outing with his new representatives Matchroom Sport after splitting from long time promoter Mick Hennessey, Barker described teaming up with Barry and Eddie Hearn at Matchroom as the "best thing to do" and said that he felt moving promoters would "benefit my career."
Middleweight World Title Attempt.
On 1 October 2011 Barker fought Argentinian Sergio Martinez for the WBC Diamond Middleweight title at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. Martinez, in his previous encounters, had worked his way up to third in the pound for pound world rankings with victories over the likes of Kelly Pavlik, Paul Williams and Sergiy Dzinziruk. The fight resulted in another successful defence for Martinez as Barker suffered a first career defeat with an 11th round knockout.
Rebuilding.
On 9 March 2013, Darren Barker began a comeback by facing off against Italy's Simone Rotolo (34-3, 15 KO's) for the vacant IBF Inter-Continental Middleweight Title in the Wembley Arena in London. Barker scored a first round knockdown and went on to win the title as Rotolo retired with an injured hand in the fourth round.
World Champion.
On 17 August 2013, Barker challenged Australian Daniel Geale for Geale's IBF Middleweight world title. Despite being knocked down by his Australian opponent in the sixth round, Barker battled back and win his first honours at world level taking a split decision victory.
First Title Defense.
In early Autumn 2013, it was announced by Eddie Hearn that Barker's first defense of the IBF Middleweight Title would be against veteran German boxer Felix Sturm at the Porsche-Arena, Stuttgart, Germany on December 7th 2013. A hip injury felled Barker twice in the second round before his corner threw in the towel. Following the fight, Barker spoke about retirement due to a recurring hip injury, for which he had received surgery a few years earlier, but remains undecided on his future.

Flag of Saarland

The flag of Saarland is based on the flag of Germany and is a black, red, and gold (yellow) horizontal tricolor. In the center of the flag is the coat of arms of Saarland. The flag of Saarland is both the civil flag "(Landesflagge)", as well as the state service flag "(Landesdienstflagge)".
History.
The Saar region was formed by the Treaty of Versailles which ended World War I. It was decided that the area belonged to Germany, but would be administered by France on behalf of the League of Nations. On 28 July 1920, it was decided that the area would use a blue, white, and black horizontal tricolour flag. This was used until 1 March 1935, when the area again came under German administration. In 1935, when Germany once again assumed control of the Saarland, it was assumed no new flag was created, since the Saarland was absorbed into the area known as Westmark.
At the conclusion of World War II the French assumed control of the Saar as a protectorate. The flag used at this time was a design with a Scandinavian cross. Left of the vertical bar of the cross was blue, and to the right was red. The colors are derived from the colors of the French flag.
When the Saar protectorate rejoined the Federal Republic of Germany, in 1957 it adopted its current flag. This is based on the flag of Germany, defaced by the Coat of arms of Saarland. The four quarters of the shield of the state coat of arms represent the historic areas of Nassau-Saarbrücken, Archbishopric and Electorate of Trier, Duchy of Lorraine, and Palatinate-Zweibrücken.

Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council, 1916–1918

This is a list of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council from 22 May 1916 to 21 May 1918. The chamber had 30 seats made up of ten provinces each electing three members, on a system of rotation whereby one-third of the members would retire at each biennial election. 
In March 1917, the Labor Party split over the matter of military conscription, with a number of Labor members of Parliament either resigning from the Party or being expelled. By May 1917, they had formed a new National Labor Party with a base in the Goldfields region, historically the heart of the Labor vote in Western Australia. In June 1917, they formed a coalition with the new Nationalist Party (which replaced the former Liberal Party) and the Country Party to form a governing coalition in the Legislative Assembly. With these arrangements, another Ministry was formed under new Premier Henry Lefroy.

Anatomy of Monotony

"Anatomy of Monotony" is a poem from the second, 1931, edition
of Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry,
"Harmonium." Unlike most of
the poems in this collection, it was first published in 1931, so it is
restricted by copyright until 2025 in America and similar
jurisdictions, because of legislation like the
Sonny Bono Copyright Term
Extension Act. However, it is quoted here in full, as justified by
fair use for the purpose of scholarly commentary.
The poet conceives us as evolving and increasingly civilized products of an
earthly process. Indeed the earth itself is growing and growing old,
while we sport our complex bodies and venture ever more sophisticated
desires. Human experience is a kind of illusion engendered by our
evolved sense organs, vulnerable to "the mother's death" and the cold
death of the universe. The spirit sees this and is aggrieved, for it
would harbor experience in some place that transcends nature, free from
the contingencies of earth and universe.
The poem can be read as ironic, as calling into question the pretension
of `the spirit'. This reading is supported by the naturalistic tenor
of the "Harmonium" collection as a whole, and specifically by the
parallel of Invective Against Swans. The
desire for transcendence of nature is one of those "finer, more
implacable chords" that the poet disavows, as also in Sunday Morning.

<doc id="19122199" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19122199" title="Manila rope">
Manila rope

Manila rope is a type of rope made from manila hemp. 
Manila hemp is a type of fiber obtained from the leaves of the abacá. It is not actually hemp, but named so because hemp was long a major source of fiber, and other fibers were sometimes named after it. The name refers to the capital of the Philippines, one of the main producers of abacá.
Applications and properties.
Manila rope is very durable, flexible, and resistant to salt water damage, allowing its use in rope, hawsers, ships' lines, and fishing nets. It can be used to make handcrafts like bags, carpets, clothing, and furniture.
Manila ropes shrink when they become wet. This effect can be advantageous under certain circumstances, but if it is not a wanted feature, it should be well taken into account. Since shrinkage is more pronounced the first time the rope becomes wet, new rope is usually immersed into water and put to dry before use so that the shrinkage is less than it would be if the rope had never been wet. A major disadvantage in this shrinkage is that many knots made with manila rope became harder and more difficult to untie when wet, thus becoming subject of increased stress.

Calyssa Rae Davidson (born December 27, 1989), is an award-winning American violinist. She is the daughter of Emmy Award winning actor, Doug Davidson, and Emmy Award nominated actress, Cindy Fisher.
Education.
Davidson was born in Beverly Hills, California. She dropped out of high school in the beginning of her junior year to pursue music, only to discover that she only needed to take two more classes to earn her high school diploma. She completed these classes at Santa Barbara City College, graduating ahead of her class. She studied violin and music theory for 3 years at the Colburn School of Performing Arts, in Los Angeles, California. She is currently attending the Royal College of Music in London, England.

Agassi–Sampras rivalry

Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are retired professional men's tennis players who were ranked World No. 1 during the 1990s, Sampras holding the world's top-rank spot for a then-record 286 weeks while Agassi held it for 101 weeks. With contrasting styles and temperaments, they played each other 34 times from 1989 through 2002, with Sampras winning 20 of their matches, and Agassi winning 14. It has been named as one of the greatest tennis rivalries of all time.
In Grand Slam tournaments, they played in five finals, with Sampras winning four. They met for the first time in a Grand Slam final at the 1990 US Open, with Agassi the favorite because of his top-three ranking even though Sampras had defeated former World No. 1 players Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe on the way to the final. Sampras defeated Agassi in straight sets.
The next time the pair met at a Grand Slam final was at the 1995 Australian Open. Agassi beat Sampras in four sets. 
In one of their matches, played in the 2001 US Open quarter-final, Sampras won with the score of 6–7(7), 7–6(2), 7–6(2), 7–6(5); throughout the match, no player managed to break the other's serve. The last match in their rivalry came at the 2002 US Open final. It was their first meeting in the final since Sampras won in 1995. Sampras went on to win the match in four sets and shortly after announced his retirement from the game. Agassi retired in 2006 after 20 years on the tour.
From their first ATP match to their 1995 US Open final match, their head-to-head was tied at 8–8. From their 1995 US Open final match to 1999, their head-to-head was 9–3 in favor of Sampras. Agassi has often said that the 1995 US Open loss was a powerful blow to him that took him years to recover from; amid this and other psychological issues he subsequently plummeted to World No. 141, and it marked a significant shift in their rivalry. From 2000 to their last match in 2002, their head-to-head was tied at 3–3. 
At the time of their retirements, Sampras held the all-time record for most men's Grand Slam titles, with 14. This broke Björn Borg's record of 11 titles won in the Open Era, as well as the 12 held then by Roy Emerson, predating the Open Era. Roger Federer has since overtaken Sampras with 17 titles. On the other hand, Agassi, who claimed 8 Grand Slam titles (joint fifth for most titles in the Open Era, and joint sixth all-time), is one of only four men to win the singles Career Grand Slam in the Open Era and one of seven overall. Having won the gold medal in men's singles at the 1996 Olympics, he is the first of only two male players to achieve a Career Golden Slam in singles tennis, the second being Rafael Nadal. The Career Grand Slam proved elusive for Sampras, as he was unable to find significant success on the serve-neutralizing clay courts, reaching only one French Open semi-final in his career. Agassi also held the record for most ATP Masters Series (AMS) shields with 17 (Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have both since overtaken him with 26 and 21 titles respectively), and has been called the best service returner in the history of the game. In retirement, Agassi and Sampras have found bonds to continue their friendship on a deeper level.

<doc id="19122288" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19122288" title="Shouting match">
Shouting match

A shouting match is an argument or debate characterized by the loud volume or intensity of the participants.
Parliamentary procedures.
Large assemblies may easily degenerate into shouting matches as the participants raise their voices in order to be heard. To control this tendency towards chaos, rules of conduct such as Robert's Rules are often used.
Productive confrontation.
Some assemblies may choose this form of discourse deliberately so that creative contributions are not stifled by formal rules. The Bourbaki working parties to establish a definitive new reference work for mathematics were conducted in this way, being described as “"Two or three monologues shouted at top voice, seemingly independently of one another"” by Armand Borel, who attributed the success of this process to the commitment and hard work of the members. At the General Electric company, the successful chief executive, Jack Welch, forced his managers to justify their positions by intensive argument that often became shouting matches. The result was to make the management confront reality and motivate them to make their proposals work.
In commerce.
Shouting matches should be avoided in commercial interactions between customers and suppliers because they tend to poison relations between the parties and so reduce the possibility of a productive deal. Training and role-playing may be used to develop the emotional intelligence required to handle such situations effectively.
In public situations such as a nightclub or bar, staff that get into shouting matches with patrons look badly unprofessional. If they instead ignore the insults, the intoxicated customers will get frustrated and leave.
Online.
Online communication in internet forums commonly takes the form of a shouting match, sometimes using ALL CAPS to denote shouting. This is due to the anonymity which reduces the possibility of sanction for intemperate speech. So, rather than a listening and rational exchange, the format fosters rage and aggression which results in extreme opinions and insults.
As social ritual.
The Yanomamo people of the Orinoco are known as "The Fierce People". When two tribes meet for a feast, their chiefs start by engaging in a ritualised shouting match in which they ostensibly engage in fierce conflict but, by their rhythmic interaction, establish a satisfying bond.

Father Knows Worst

"Father Knows Worst" is the eighteenth episode of the twentieth season of "The Simpsons". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 26, 2009. In the episode, Bart and Lisa start struggling in their academic and social lives at school and Homer starts monitoring them and forcing them to do better, becoming a helicopter parent. Meanwhile, Marge discovers a sauna in the basement. This was the first episode in over eight years written by Rob LaZebnik.
Plot.
Homer, Bart and Lisa go to the carnival on the South-Side Sea Port, and Homer indulges in various varieties of kabobs. While devouring them indiscriminately, he accidentally swallows a flaming stick. He tries to douse it out with water, but gets tricked by Bart into drinking lighter fluid (prompting Homer to strangle and breathe fire at him). Following a brief stint in a tongue cast, Homer's taste buds become hypersensitive, making eating ordinary food an ordeal. Lisa remedies the problem by giving Homer cafeteria food from Springfield Elementary, which is so bland that a supertaster like Homer can tolerate it. Homer decides to dine at the elementary school (and even goes so far as to be a cafeteria server), much to the embarrassment of Bart.
While dining at the school, Homer meets a "helicopter mom", who pressures her son Noah into succeeding by being near him at all times. She makes snide remarks about Homer's children, pointing out how dumb Bart is and how much of a social outcast Lisa is. Homer decides to become a "helicopter parent", fearing that his children's only ambition in life will be to serve children like Noah. Bart must build a balsa wood model to compete in a sculpture assignment, and Homer insists on helping. While shopping for balsa wood, Homer reveals that Bart will build the Washington Monument, but Principal Skinner criticizes this as overly easy. In response, Homer purchases a model kit of Westminster Abbey. He buys a book for Lisa entitled "Chicks with Cliques," and persuades her to try joining a clique, first by declaring that dolphins swim in "cliques" and that the United States was founded by a clique, and then by hosting a cellphone-decorating party for the popular girls.
Homer is convinced that Bart will not build the Abbey model correctly and insists on building it himself. He works late into the night and accidentally falls asleep. During a dream sequence, ghosts of some of the historical figures Homer imagines are buried in Westminster Abbey — including Oscar Wilde, who is actually buried in Paris — advise Homer to let Bart learn from his mistakes. Homer awakes to find he has accidentally crushed the model beyond recognition. At the competition, Superintendent Chalmers notes that Bart's model is the only one that does not appear "too perfect," and thus believes that Bart's model is the only one that was not constructed with the help of a parent, but Bart declines the award and reveals that Homer did all the work. Lisa too confesses to her father that she no longer wants to be popular, noting that "it's hard work being this shallow."
Meanwhile, Marge changes the water heater in the basement and discovers a hidden sauna, keeping it to herself out of fear that Homer will invite his friends and Moe (the latter of whom did not bring a towel because he thought the rest would "go Scandinavian"). Marge visits the sauna on a regular basis and is so deeply relaxed that she does not react when Homer tells her of Bart and Lisa's problems. After Bart declines the balsa model award and Lisa leaves her clique, Homer believes he has failed as a parent. Marge leads him downstairs to the sauna where they revel in steam and relaxation. In the end, Marge douses the sauna rocks with beer and as their towels fall off the two rut like rabbits.
Reception.
The episode received a 4.5/6 Nielsen rating and was watched by 5.94 million viewers. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said "Father Knows Worst" is a "middle-of-the-road" "Simpsons" episode, as "it lands right in the middle between the best "Simpsons" episodes and the worst. Even though Marge and Maggie are completely wasted, and Lisa’s storyline barely gets off the ground, seeing Homer try at anything is good for a laugh, especially if that something is parenting and includes him imagining Marge water-skiing on a stegosaurus. Not exactly a model episode, but a decent entry all the same." Robert Canning of IGN enjoyed the episode. He said, "The main story was entertaining, and the random jokes throughout the episode added to the quality." He went on to say, "All in all, it's tough to complain when the story is solid and the jokes are funny." In addition, Dan Castellaneta won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Homer Simpson in this episode, marking his fourth win for that award.

Four Great Women and a Manicure

"Four Great Women and a Manicure" is the twentieth episode of the twentieth season of "The Simpsons". First broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 10, 2009, it was the second Simpsons episode (after "Simpsons Bible Stories") to have four acts instead of the usual three. The episode tells four tales of famous women featuring "Simpsons" characters in various roles: Selma as Queen Elizabeth I, Lisa as Snow White, Marge as Lady Macbeth and Maggie as Howard Roark from Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead".
Jodie Foster performs the voice of Maggie Simpson. The title is a reference to the 1994 film "Four Weddings and a Funeral". The episode was the lowest-rated episode in terms of viewers in the show's history at the time, though it has since been surpassed. It is the only episode in the history of the show in which Bart Simpson is not seen or mentioned (not counting the opening credits). It is also the second episode (after "Mona Leaves-a") to first air on Mother's Day and deal with women or mothers.
Plot.
Marge takes Lisa to a salon for her first manicure, prompting a debate as to whether a woman can simultaneously be smart, powerful and beautiful.
Queen Elizabeth I.
In the first tale, Marge tells the story of Queen Elizabeth I, with Selma Bouvier playing the Queen.
Various royal suitors wish to win the hand of Queen Elizabeth, including a flamboyant King Julio of Spain. The Queen rejects his advances and King Julio vows revenge on England, summoning the Spanish Armada. Meanwhile, Walter Raleigh, played by Homer, falls for Queen Elizabeth's Lady in Waiting, played by Marge.
When Elizabeth catches the two making out, she sentences them to execution. They are saved at the last minute when Moe dashes in, reporting the arrival of the Spanish Armada. Homer leads an English naval offense against the Armada, defeating them by accidentally setting the lone English warship on fire, which then spreads to the entire Spanish fleet. Queen Elizabeth knights him and then proclaims, "I don't need a man, for I have England" (with Moe sarcastically quipping, "Yeah, you keep telling yourself that").
Snow White.
In the second tale, Lisa tells the story of Snow White, with herself in the title role.
Her version features the dwarves Crabby (Moe), Drunky (Barney), Hungry (Homer), Greedy (Mr. Burns), Lenny (Lenny), Kearney (Kearney) and Doc (...tor Hibbert), following the appearance of the Blue-Haired Lawyer who tells Lisa that "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" has been copyrighted by the Walt Disney Corporation, prompting Lisa to change the characters to avoid being sued. When the wicked queen learns from her magic HD television that Snow White is fairer than she is, she dispatches her huntsman (Groundskeeper Willie) to murder the young maiden. However, Willie the huntsman cannot bring himself to cut out her heart (or to cut out a pig's heart or to cut a heart out of construction paper) and Snow White runs away to the forest, seeking shelter in the dwarves' cottage. She keeps house for them while they work in the mines but the wicked queen, disguised as an old woman, physically forces Snow White to eat a poisoned apple. She escapes the dwarves, only to be brutally lynched by an angry group of woodland animals. In Lisa's version, Snow White doesn't need a man to wake her but is brought back to life by a female doctor.
Lady Macbeth.
In the third tale, Marge relates a story of ruthless ambition, embodied by Lady Macbeth.
Marge (parodying Lady Macbeth) is frustrated with everything. Not only does she have to clean the costumes worn by the other actors, but also Homer does not have the title role in a Springfield production of "Macbeth" and instead plays a tree. She convinces him to murder the lead actor, Sideshow Mel. Homer follows her command and then assumes the role of Macbeth. However, his performance receives unfavorable reviews, even compared with other actors with no lines. Furious, Marge orders Homer to continue his killing spree until he is the only actor left.
While scrubbing the blood from the costumes, Marge is visited by the angry spirits of the actors she has had murdered. She tries to put the blame on Homer, but they refuse to believe her. The spirits are well aware that he was a mere puppet in Marge's plans and level their anger at her. Finally, they kill Marge by causing a fright-induced heart attack in revenge. In her memory (or rather, by her spirit force, since she apparently has not learned her lesson or anything from the experience), Homer performs a stirring soliloquy in the empty theater. Marge's ghost appears in the audience and raves that he has finally given a great performance. She is overjoyed and urges him to appear in more Shakespearean plays by tossing scripts in front of him. However much to Marge's chagrin, Homer decides to kill himself so he doesn't have to audition any more. In his ghost form, a pleased Homer tells her off that auditioning for those plays would be a real tragedy for him and is free to be lazy. A frustrated Marge is forced to learn her lesson the hard way when she realizes that she has to spend the rest of eternity with Homer.
Maggie Roark.
In the final tale, Maggie is depicted as "Maggie Roark," representing Howard Roark from Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead".
Maggie's architectural brilliance is squashed by an oppressive pre-school teacher (Ellsworth Toohey) who encourages only conformity. She builds several famous landmarks (such as The Taj Mahal in India and The Bird's Nest in Beijing, China) out of blocks and other toys, all of which are destroyed by Toohey (to the strains of Beethoven's 9th symphony, 2nd movement), who disapproves of the superiority of her creations over those of the other children. During a Parents' Day at Mediocri-Tots Day Care Center, Maggie dazzles everyone with her rendition of the Empire State Building and ends up on trial for expressing herself. During the trial, Maggie (voiced by Jodie Foster) defends herself by stating that the creative people of her time have never compromised their talent for the sake of others and neither will she. Years later, Maggie is shown as a successful architect who opens a daycare center dedicated to letting babies express themselves freely.
Ending.
The rest of the story is interrupted when Marge stops Maggie from painting Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night" on the nail salon wall, scolding her for "soiling" the wall and not realizing the irony.
Reception.
This episode was watched by 5.16 million viewers, making it not only the least watched episode of the twentieth season but also the third least watched in the series' history (after "The Great Simpsina" and "Million Dollar Maybe"). It was, however, the second most watched show of the night on Fox after "Family Guy".
Steve Heisler of "The A.V. Club" graded the episode a "C-", stating "[...] tonight's classically themed outing didn't fare very well, starting with the story of one of the Bouvier sisters as Queen Elizabeth—an episode segment that clocked in at just over four minutes, far too short a time to do anything lasting... or funny. The longest stretch came near the end, in the form of an extended riff on MacBeth involving Homer killing a ton of people. But aside from the occasional random line or two, it was pretty much a boring retelling of the tale, with Simpsons characters subbing in for Shakespearean ones. So I guess the question is: How much pleasure is there to milk from seeing familiar yellow people reenact parts of Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead"? Given the show's shaky streak lately, not nearly enough."

Going into the second rest day, the field faced a hilly stage, with two second and one third-category climb along the course and lots of descending. The final 40 kilometers, after the second-category Alto del Carracol, undulated very gently, so any type of finish was seen as possible.
The escaping breakaway formed after 10 kilometers, involving Sébastien Hinault, Sandy Casar, and Manuel Quinziato. As the breakaway formed, Tinkoff tried to place a rider in it, but was unsuccessful. The main field was paced alternately by Caisse d'Epargne, Quick Step, and Lampre, and their pace combined with the cold and rainy weather of the day proved a tough test for many riders, dropping back from the field. An unexpected rider to crack, toward the end of the stage, was Alejandro Valverde, who finished more than 3 minutes behind the stage winner and fell out of the top ten in the GC. The rest of his Caisse d'Epargne team went back with him to try to pace him back into the front group, but they were not successful. Ezequiel Mosquera also fell out of the front group briefly, but his Xacobeo-Galicia teammates were able to get him back in there.
The pace that Quick Step and Lampre set kept it so that the breakaway never attained more than 4 minutes of advantage. They were caught well before the line, with some 30 kilometers to race. A 28-man group was together with a sizeable advantage over the rest of the field in the stage's final minutes. The group had several members of the top teams in the GC, Astana and Euskaltel-Euskadi, who took the pace. Alberto Contador was the first of this group to attack for the stage win, but the victory went to Paolo Bettini, who had ironically given interviews earlier in the day describing his dissatisfaction over his team Quick Step signing Stefan Schumacher from the dissolving and vowed to ride for someone else in 2009. Contador took back three seconds on Egoi Martínez in the final sprint to the line.
Rest day.
12 September 2008
Stage 13.
13 September 2008 – San Vicente de la Barquera to Alto de El Angliru, 209 km 
There were five categorized climbs on this course, including three first-category hills, but the main attraction was the special-category Alto de El Angliru at the finish, which made its fourth appearance in the Vuelta and first since 2002. This brutal climb featured gradients as high as 23% near the summit.
The Euskaltel team kept several attempted breakaways in the first hour from going clear. This was not to protect the overall lead of Egoi Martínez, which was all but assured to be lost on such a stage (as Martínez was not seen as a strong enough climber in comparison with others high in the GC), but to protect the chances of victory in the Vuelta's queen stage for Igor Antón. Ironically, Antón would fail to even finish the stage, abandoning after sustaining a broken collarbone in a crash climbing Angliru.
The rider that succeeded at coming clear was Christophe Kern, allowed to leave after 37 kilometers and an hour in the saddle. Shortly afterward, a two-man chase was formed, comprising Maarten Tjallingii and Matej Jurčo. With so much more looming at the finish, the main field was more than content to let these three top the third-category Alto de Ortigueiro well ahead of them. After the descent, Kern pulled up and literally waited at the side of the road for about two minutes for the other two to join him, so they could all work together.
The Astana Team came forward to take the pace at the bottom of the first first-category climb of the day, the Puerto de Arnicio. The breakaway's lead at this point was 11 minutes, but it slowly and steadily fell until a 20-man group who were able to take Astana's pace caught them just after the summit of the third first-category hill, the Alto del Cordal. Domestiques from Astana and Caisse d'Epargne traded shots setting the pace up the Alto de El Angliru, going up to the finish line. As the climb neared its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the end, it was Levi Leipheimer who came forward to sacrifice himself for Alberto Contador, setting a pace that cracked everyone in the group (and caused Leipheimer himself to bonk), but left Contador free to attack for the stage win. The golden jersey came with it.
Stage 14.
14 September 2008 – Oviedo to Fuentes de Invierno, 158 km 
This stage went from hilly to mountainous. There were six categorized climbs on this course, three first-category and three third-category. The three third-category hills were all in the first 35 kilometers, leaving the riders to tackle three first-category climbs over the remainder of the stage, ending nearly as high in elevation as they did the previous day at Angliru when they headed up to the ski resort Fuentes de Invierno.
An eight-man group broke free of the main field after 25 kilometers, just before the third-category climb of San Tirso. A three-man chase joined them on the descent, and the eleven were away as a sustained group for much of the stage. Their maximum advantage grew to five minutes before the main field, paced mostly by Caisse d'Epargne rather than the race leader's Astana Team, started to reel them in. Their sporting director Eusebio Unzue explained that the breakaway had unexepectedly contained some high-profile riders and they needed to keep the time gap as low as possible to try to work for a stage win for Alejandro Valverde at Fuentes de Invierno.
Ezequiel Mosquera made attack after attack on the way up to the summit, and only Valverde and the Astana duo of race leader Alberto Contador and teammate Levi Leipheimer were able to answer. Eventually, Valverde also fell, and the stage was contested among the other three. Contador attacked within a kilometer of the finish and Mosquera couldn't answer, giving Contador a second straight stage win. This time, he had three leader's jerseys awaiting him on the podium - the golden, the white, and the points classification blue jersey.
It was later revealed that Contador and Valverde had struck a deal that they would stick together on the stage and Valverde would take the stage win while Contador retained the overall lead in the Vuelta. However, when Mosquera's attacks cracked Valverde, Contador took the opportunity for the stage win.
Stage 15.
15 September 2008 – Cudillero to Ponferrada, 202 km 
This stage had a first, a second, and a third-category climb on it, in succession. There was as well an uncategorized hill about 10 kilometers before the finish that was thought to keep any sprinters that survived that far honest.
The day's breakaway formed after a little over 50 kilometers, as several escape attempts consolidated into one 17-man breakaway. Their lead grew to a maximum of nearly 17 minutes, as the Astana-paced main field was more than content to let them go, seeing no threats in the group. José Luis Arrieta, Juan Manuel Gárate, and David Arroyo traded attacks on the way into Ponferrada, that cracked some of their breakaway mates who finished as much as seven minutes behind them, but it was Xacobeo-Galicia rider David García who won the stage, launching the decisive attack 3 kilometers from the line. The main field finished 14'23" behind the stage winner, but there were no changes to the top ten in the GC.
Stage 16.
16 September 2008 – Ponferrada to Zamora, 186 km
After the first-category Alto del Acebo at the 15 kilometer mark, the riders escaped the mountains for the time being - there were no further categorized climbs in this stage or the next one. After the descent, the course didn't so much as undulate, so a bunched sprint finish was expected.
The field took it very easy for the first hour. There were no breakaway attempts, and that first hour in the saddle covered just the 15 kilometers to the Alto de Acebo. On the descent, the attacks began. Jesús Rosendo, who had earlier in the Vuelta been the first leader of the King of the Mountains, and Walter Fernando Pedraza were the ones that got away, and attained a maximum advantage of 8 minutes on the main field. The field was pulled along not by the race leader's team Astana, but by Quick Step, and in particular Paolo Bettini, working to get Tom Boonen a second stage victory in this Vuelta. The teams of other prominent sprinters came forward to take the pace over from Bettini when he later needed medical attention. The catch occurred 7 kilometers from the line, and Boonen indeed won his second bunched sprint, after an early leadout headed by Bettini.
Stage 17.
17 September 2008 – Zamora to Valladolid, 148 km
An almost totally flat stage 17 was the reward for the sprinters who made it this far. There were no categorized climbs at all on this course. While there were not be any hills, it was thought that crosswinds would present a bother to the sprinters in the field.
Pedro Horrillo and José Ruiz broke free of the main field after 13 kilometers. The main field kept them well within reach, and kept several other escape attempts from going clear. Horrillo and Ruiz attained a maximum advantage of over 8 minutes, but the bunch, behind the pace of Silence-Lotto and Euskaltel-Euskadi, caught them 7 kilometers from the line. Imanol Erviti tried to attack 3 kilometers from the finish, but the field caught him. The vast majority of the field finished together, and there was no significant change in the GC for the fourth day in a row.
Stage 18.
18 September 2008– Valladolid to Las Rozas, 167 km
Branded as flat, this stage gradually increasesd in elevation to its one categorized climb, the third-category Alto de los Leones at the 39 kilometers to go mark, and then gradually decreased to the finishing town of Las Rozas. Another mass sprint finish was expected, but it did not occur.
After a blisteringly fast first hour that covered nearly 50 kilometers and kept several breakaway attempts from going free, an 18-man break formed at the 56 kilometer mark. The best-placed rider in the break was Nicolas Roche, 17th overall and 19'31" behind race leader Alberto Contador. The second hour in the saddle saw the pace ease up, as Contador's Astana Team was content to let the breakaway go, since they did not figure to gain nineteen and a half minutes in such a course. The advantage grew to a maximum of 8'15" before the riders in the breakaway began attacking each other and fragmenting. The field didn't take much advantage, as they finished 7'29" behind the stage winner. Roche appeared to launch the decisive attack into Las Rozas and to be in line for the stage win, but it was Imanol Erviti, who had attacked too early and paid the price the previous day, who timed the finishing kick just right and overtook Roche in the final meters to win the stage. There was again no significant change in the GC after this stage.
Stage 19.
19 September 2008– Las Rozas to Segovia, 145 km
This stage offered one last taste of the mountains for the 2008 Vuelta before the time trial and the traditional finish in Madrid. There was a short circuit, of which the riders took 2 laps, in the finishing town of Segovia, thought to leave the type of finish up in the air.
The day's breakaway formed slowly, over the course of almost ten kilometers after nearly an hour and a half in the saddle. It numbered fourteen riders, including four from Caisse d'Epargne, which boded well for Alejandro Valverde. The elite group of favorites, another thirteen strong, never let them get more than two minutes' advantage, and caught them with a third of the stage left to race. Numerous riders launched further attacks on the way into Segovia, with none coming more than ten seconds clear. Perhaps the most aggressive among them was Vasili Kiryienka, who was narrowly defeated in his spring to the line by David Arroyo. The group of GC favorites finished 11 seconds behind the stage winner, and only the bonus seconds won by Joaquín Rodríguez in intermediate sprints caused the GC to change in any way.
Stage 20.
20 September 2008 – La Granja de San Ildefonso to Alto de Navacerrada, 17 km (ITT)
This time trial was short, but was thought to still live up to the billing the race against the clock gets as the "race of truth" - it ended at the first-category Alto de Navacerrada. The last 7 kilometers of the course were all uphill.
The early time to beat was set by Rubén Pérez, but, true to form, the GC contenders, strong climbers all of them, all solidly defeated Pérez's time. Carlos Sastre rode with strength and consistency, to hold off the charge of Ezequiel Mosquera and keep his podium position. Young Rabobank rider Robert Gesink slipped two spots in the GC at the end of the day, but was still in the top ten for the time trial, showing how fast, tightly bunched, and truly elite the group of riders ahead of him was. Levi Leipheimer had the best time at each intermediate time check and went on to win the stage by more than 30 seconds over his teammate and team leader Alberto Contador. Contador later took some offense to Leipheimer seemingly riding with winning the Vuelta in mind, after it had been established earlier that he (Contador) was Astana's team leader. Contador nonetheless rode a very strong time trial as well, enough to retain his golden jersey and put him on the cusp of being the youngest ever to win all three cycling Grand Tours in his career and just the third ever, and first in 27 years, to win the Vuelta and the Giro d'Italia in the same year.
Stage 21.
21 September 2008 – San Sebastián de los Reyes to Madrid, 102 km
The sprinters got the final say in one last mad dash for the line in the traditional closing city.
As is tradition when the last day of a Grand Tour is a road stage, this was a straightforward day of racing with no attacking before reaching the closing city. Once on the Madrid circuit, many riders tried to break free of the pack, but none ultimately succeeded - the group was all one in the eighth and final lap. During that eighth lap, two huge crashes thinned the field considerably and limited who could challenge for the stage win. Among the riders to fall was Vuelta champion Alberto Contador. They took place inside 3 kilometers to the finish line, and since this was a flat stage, everyone who fell was given the same finishing time as the group they were in upon falling, which meant the entire field got the same finishing time. The stage was won by CSC's Matti Breschel.

Kamio Mitsuomi

Biography.
Kamio was the younger son of Kamio Heizaburō, a samurai retainer of the Suwa clan in Shinano province (present-day Nagano prefecture). He graduated from military academy in 1874, and served as a sergeant in the Imperial infantry during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. He rose rapidly through the ranks, to sergeant-major and then was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant by the end of the same year. His commission was confirmed as official by the end of the war, and in 1882 was promoted to full lieutenant.
Kamio served in Qing dynasty China as a military attaché from 1885–86, during which time he was promoted to captain. On his return to Japan, he was assigned to various staff positions, and became a major in December 1891.
He returned to China again as a military attaché attached to the Japanese embassy in Beijing from 1892–1894. With the outbreak of the 1894–95 First Sino-Japanese War, he was a staff officer attached to Japanese Second Army. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel at the end of the war, and then to full colonel in 1897 when he assumed command of the 3rd Imperial Guard Regiment.
Kamio was sent to Europe from February 1899 to April 1900. Subsequently he was Chief of Staff of the IJA 1st Division in 1900, and of the IJA 10th Division the following year. In May 1902, he was promoted to major general.
During the Russo-Japanese War, Kamio held a series of further divisional commands: with 22nd Brigade, Japanese China Garrison Army, IJA 9th Division and IJA 18th Division, but not within front-line combat units. In December 1908, he was further promoted to lieutenant general. He was commander of the IJA 18th Division from 1912.
After the start of World War I, Kamio, with a reputation for solid caution rather than brilliance, was selected to lead Allied ground forces in the seizure of Tsingtao from Germany. Kamio made lavish use of logistics and overwhelming firepower to spare bloodshed as much as possible.
In November 1914, Kamio's 18th Division of 23,000 men backed by 142 guns began a bombardment of the port on 2 September 1914. The port fell a little over two months later, Kamio's siege tactics earning him praise for the skill with which he carefully deployed artillery tactics to aid infantry advances.
Kamio served thereafter as Japanese governor of Tsingtao and was promoted to full general in June 1916. A month later, he was honored with elevation to the rank of baron ("danshaku") under the "kazoku" peerage system.
He entered the reserves in August 1917, and retired completely in 1925. He died in 1927 and is buried at Zōshigaya cemetery.

Nova Scotia Voice of Women

The Nova Scotia Voice of Women for Peace (NSVOW) is an active branch of the Canadian Voice of Women for Peace (VOW). Established in 1960, VOW is a local, national and international feminist Non Governmental Organization (NGO) composed of diverse women with consultative status at the United Nations Economic & Social Council (ECOSOC). For almost 50 years, VOW has tirelessly advocated a world without war. The organization's mandate is to "provide a means for women to promote world peace and justice, through education of themselves and others to take an equal part in the democratic process of decision making; and to cooperate with women throughout the world to create the mutual respect and understanding necessary for the peaceful resolution of international conflict."
History.
The Canadian Voice of Women began in 1960 as a popular social movement opposed to nuclear weapons. Muriel Duckworth and Peggy Hope-Simpson were among the founding members of the Nova Scotia Chapter. Because of concerns raised by the Cold War, the time was ripe for ordinary women to become politically active. As Muriel herself explains it:
The Voice of Women grew out of fear of nuclear testing in the 1950s. Around the country, there were already women on the verge of organizing a women's peace group and when it happened, women poured into the membership, because it was such a dangerous time. The women who had come here as war brides were just beside themselves because they couldn't bear the thought of another war.
Current activities.
Among other activities, NSVOW holds a monthly vigil in Halifax, Canada, and co-hosts an annual Peace Day at the World Peace Pavilion in Dartmouth, NS, Canada on August 6, to commemorate the tragedy in Hiroshima. Their current campaign includes encouraging Nova Scotia municipalities to join Mayors For Peace.

Bagra (caste)

Bagra Brahmin (pronounced as Bagda/बाग़डा ) is a part of the Brahmin community mainly concentrated in and around Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India, although members of this community can be found throughout India and also in foreign countries. Basically this is a community of farmers and landlords; however, of late, people of this community are taking education seriously and have shown their presence in business, sciences, the services sector, medicine, higher government jobs, etc. They use Sharma as their surname in common. They are considered in general category, in accordance with the constitution of India. The origin of this community is based on a myth which is not popular even among them, especially among the young belt. 
This community originally lived in geographical parts of Haryana connecting through Shekhawati region of Baggad in Sikar district. A large majority of Bagra Brahamins are residing in Thanagazi tehsil of Alwar district in Rajasthan. Even, they are divided in sub-castes within this community. This category includes such as "Seemawat, Pancholi, Pandey, Daunda, Pradhan, Khoj, Rawal, Khakhsa" etc. It is very interesting and fascinating to know the fact that these sub-branches are further divided in mini-branches, to which they call "foot" (division) in their colloquial language. Though there are some exceptions of such lineage viz "Seemawat" and "Pandey". People of both of these sub-communities are considered as cool as breeze in their nature. They generally treat the others with open heart, demonstrating the immense hospitality as an ideal example of human being. The word "Seemawat/सीमावत" is related to the Hindi word, Mawat (who guides the elephant), suggesting the calmness and absolute composure in their daily life. In earlier time people would call, See! (Look) Mawat is coming which turned into the present word as Seemawat. The comely nature of these people can be gauged by the following lovely lines which are heart stirring;प्यार बरसे चहुँ ओर, दुनिया में अमन हो, नफरत का ना हो शोर, दुनिया में अमन हो,
Bagras are supposed to be Rajpurohit of Tomara clan (community) which is one of the sub-branches of Rajput community. Even, Bagra community can be seen as the inhabitant around Delhi and Gurgaun region where members of their caste are involved in various enterprises like grocery shop, interior designing, milk dairy etc. Most of them are non-alcoholic and pure vegetarians. The new generation of this community is marching towards a bright future by breaking the orthodox rational-less traditions. In Thanagazi, region most of the shops (of tea, grocery, sweets, cyber-cafe, cosmetic products' agency, medical, mobile, foot wearings, clothes etc.) are handled by people of this community. A village of Thanagazi thsil, named as Bhudiawas is well-known for lots of Canteen shops as self-employed business spreading from Alwar to Leh including Jammu, Kashmir, Kolkata, Udhampur, Itanagar, Nagaland etc. " यहाँ पर एक लोक कहावत है कि वह खेत नही जिसमें आकड़ा नहीं हो, और वह गांव नही जिसमें बाग़डा नही हो !" 
Over the ages, the Brahmins in general, and Bagda Brahmins in particular, have branched out based on their regional and occupational similarities. They have started, for long, accepting matrimonial alliances within their such regional categories, by distinguishing their lineage as "shasan" or "alla" rather than their rishi gotras, as was the original institutional norm. 
A Bagda Brahmin, Pandit Sudhir Kumar Bagda is the Raj Purohit of Jaipur Royal Family.

Frederick Hollyer

Frederick Hollyer (17 June 1838 - 21 November 1933) was an English photographer and engraver known for his photographic reproductions of paintings and drawings, particularly those of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and for portraits of literary and artistic figures of late Victorian and Edwardian London.
Family.
Hollyer was the youngest son of Samuel Hollyer (1797–1883), a line engraver, fine art publisher, collector of watercolours, and Deputy Sealer at the Court of Chancery until 1853, when the post was abolished. His brothers Christopher Charles Hollyer (1836–1874), and Samuel Hollyer Jr. (1826–1919) also worked as engravers. Frederick Hollyer's first published works were mezzotint engravings of two paintings by Edwin Landseer published by J. McQueen in 1869.
Photographic career.
Hollyer became interested in photography about 1860. He made albumen and carbon prints, but his preferred medium was the "platinotype" or platinum print process, admired for its permanence and great tonal range. Under the patronage of Frederic Leighton, Hollyer began to photograph paintings and drawings in the 1870s. Artists whose work he published include Edward Burne-Jones, George Frederic Watts, Simeon Solomon, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Of his work with the Pre-Raphaelites, "The Times" noted that
Hollyer's photographs of drawings were particularly successful; printed on high-quality paper, they were often mistaken for originals. One of the most popular was a study of three heads by Burne-Jones for "The Masque of Cupid".
Hollyer also took studio portraits and specialized in interior and exterior photos of houses. For 30 years, he reserved Mondays for portrait photography in his Pembroke Square studio. His sitters included the artists Walter Crane, William Morris, G. F. Watts, and Burne-Jones; the writers John Ruskin, H. G. Wells, and George Bernard Shaw; and the actresses Mrs Patrick Campbell and Ellen Terry. Hollyer eschewed the formal poses of most studio portraiture of his day; in an 1899 interview in "The Photogram" he said
Hollyer did much to establish photography as a fine art. His work was widely acclaimed in his own day; in 1897, a critic in "The Studio" lamented: 
Hollyer joined the Royal Photographic Society 1865 and became a Fellow in 1895, but was also involved in The Linked Ring, a society formed in to support pictorialism in opposition to the Photographic Society. He was a member of the Solar Club and became one of the Founder Members of the Professional Photographers' Association in 1901.
Later life.
Frederick Hollyer married Mary Anne Armstrong (1838–1913). Their eldest son Frederick Thomas Hollyer (1870–1952) worked with his father and took over the studio when the elder Hollyer retired in 1913. Frederick Hollyer died 21 November 1933 at his eldest son's home in Blewbury (then part of Berkshire), aged 95.
Today, Hollyer is remembered chiefly for his photographs of Burne-Jones, William Morris, and their circle. Under British copyright law, Hollyer's photographs are now public domain as he died more than 70 years ago.

Anthony Günther, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst

Anthony Günther, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst (11 January 1653 – 10 December 1714) was a German prince of the House of Ascania.
He was born in Zerbst, the fourth (but second surviving) son of John VI, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Sophie Auguste, daughter of Frederick III, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp.
Life.
After the death of his father in 1667, Anthony Günther received the castle of Mühlingen. The During his minority, his mother the Dowager Princess Sophie Auguste acted as regent.
In 1669 he and his older brother Karl William started their Grand Tour and visited Holland, England, France, and Italy; they only returned to Zerbst in 1672. Soon afterwards he began his military career and fought in Italy against France under the command of Johann Karl, Palatine Count of Birkenfeld, and was present at the sieges of Oudenaarde, Grave (1674) and Philippsburg (1676). After the Treaty of Nijmegen he stayed in Italy until 1681, when he returned to Zerbst. One year later he travelled again, this time to Denmark, Sweden, Courland, and Poland. Under the command of the Elector John George III of Saxony, he fought in the Battle of Vienna (1683).
In 1689 the war against King Louis XIV of France was renewed; he moved with the Brandenburg troops outside Bonn, where he distinguished himself in battle; for this, the Elector Frederick III (later King Frederick I of Prussia) called him "Obersten" ("The Highest"). Anthony Günther marched in 1690 with the Brandenburg troops to Brabant and became Commandant of Ath. In 1692 he fought in the Battle of Steenkerque, where he received five shots in his left arm. Hardly recovered from his wounds, he got another shot in Landau, once again in the arm. Now in charge of a battalion, King William III of England in 1694 appointed him Commander-in-Chief of a brigade of 9 battalions and in 1695 handed him over the governorship of Ath, whose fortress he had surrendered, however, after a brave defense, to Catinat.
In 1698 he was appointed Major-General by the Elector of Brandenburg, and at the same time received command of about 5000 Brandenburg "Hülfstruppen" who had acted in the service of the Dutch Republic. In this position he was present at the siege of Bonn and was wounded by a mat ball in the chest. After the taking of Bonn he went to Brabant and took Huy. Nonetheless, his health was severely weakened by so many wounds and shortly after resigned his command.
After a visit to the Aachen baths, he returned from Berlin to Zerbst. In 1705 King Frederick I appointed him General-Lieutenant.
Marriage and issue.
Around 1680, Anthony Günther began an affair with the delicate and beautiful Auguste Antonie Marschall of Bieberstein (b. Zerbst, 3 March 1659 – d. Calbe, 28 December 1736), a lady-in-waiting of his mother. She lived under the name of "Madame Güntherode" in Naumburg, where the prince regularly visited her in the short intervals between his long trips. The union only produced a daughter:
After his definitive return home, Anthony Günther formally married his beloved Auguste in Zerbst on 1 January 1705; shortly after, she was created "Frau von Günthersfeld." Because Auguste was born into the lesser nobility, the marriage was morganatic and their daughter Antoinette, legitimized by the wedding, could only assume the surname "von Günthersfeld," her mother's new title.
The couple lived quietly at times in Zerbst and at times in Schloss Mühlingen. Dedicating himself during his last years to religion, Anthony Günther died in Zerbst without male issue, and his principality was merged again into Anhalt-Zerbst.

Charles Wilson (composer)

Charles Mills Wilson (b. Toronto, 8 May 1931) is a Canadian composer, choral conductor, and music educator. 
Biography.
Wilson began studying piano at age six with Wilfred Powell and later studied organ with Charles Peaker. He studied composition with Godfrey Ridout at the University of Toronto, earning a Bachelors of Music in 1952 and a Doctorate of Music Composition in 1956. While at the University of Toronto, Wilson also studied at the Berkshire Music Center, at Tanglewood, during the summers with such noted composers as Lukas Foss, Aaron Copland and Carlos Chávez. He became interested in choral music and spent much of his time studying choral conducting. In 1953, Wilson taught music theory and conducted the University Chorale at the University of Saskatchewan while simultaneously finishing his doctoral thesis/composition, "Symphony in A". From 1954-1964 he served as the organist and choirmaster at Chalmer United Church in Guelph, Ontario. While there he founded the Guelph Light Opera and Oratorio Company (later the Guelph Opera and Concert Singers) in 1955, conducting their performances until 1974. During these years he conducted choirs and bands and taught high school in the Guelph area and was for a time music supervisor of Guelph Township public schools. He also conducted the Bach-Elgar Choir of Hamilton from 1962–1974 and was the choirmaster of the Canadian Opera Company from 1973–1981. In 1979 he was appointed to the faculty of music at the University of Guelph where he later became composer-in-residence and the director of the electronic music studio. He retired in 1994. 
Compositions.
As a composer, Wilson is known for employing an eclectic range of musical idioms from serialism to indeterminacy while maintaining a strong emotional lyricism and sense of tonality. His early compositions were primarily instrumental chamber music while his latter output has been more focused on vocal music including operas, choral works, and art songs. He has written one oratorio, "The Angels of the Earth" (1966) and numerous operas. His opera "Héloise and Abelard" (1972) was commissioned by the Canadian Opera Company to mark its 25th anniversary and his opera "Psycho Red" (1977) was commissioned by the Guelph Spring Festival. His other operas include "The Selfish Giant" (1973), "The Summoning of Everyman" (1973), and 
"Kamouraska" (1975).
Wilson has also composed works for the Canadian Children's Opera Chorus, the Festival Singers of Canada, the Canadian Brass, and Dalhousie University. He is an associate of the Canadian Music Centre.

USS West Alsek (ID-3119)

USS "West Alsek" (ID-3119) was a cargo ship in the United States Navy during World War I. She had been built as SS "West Alsek" for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) as part of the "West" boats, cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States. She sailed on two voyages for the U.S. Navy before she was decommissioned after the Armistice.
"West Alsek" was selected for a test program by the addition of coal pulverizers—units that crushed coal and mixed it with air for injection into the boilers. She became the first steamship to cross the Atlantic ocean depending solely on pulverized coal. Test results showed that she sailed faster and used less coal than before the conversion. "West Alsek" was later abandoned by the USSB and scrapped in 1933.
Design and construction.
The "West" ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word "West", like "West Alsek", named, in part, after the Alsek River in Alaska. "West Alsek" was one of some 24 "West" ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle, Washington.
"West Alsek" (Skinner & Eddy No. 22, USSB No. 87) was launched on 4 May 1918 and delivered to the United States Navy upon completion later in the month. "West Alsek" was built in a total of 78 working days, 92 calendar days, and was tied with three other ships for tenth place on a list of the ten fastest constructed ocean-going vessels compiled in 1920. Skinner & Eddy received a $25,000 bonus for completing the ship early. 
The ship was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. "West Alsek" had a steel hull and a mean draft of . She displaced 12,226 t, and had a deadweight tonnage of . The ship had a single triple-expansion steam engine powered by three coal-fired boilers that generated and drove her single screw propeller, and moved the ship at a pace.
Military career.
USS "West Alsek" (ID-3119) was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) on 4 June with Lieutenant Commander J. S. Gibson, USNRF, in command. "West Alsek" took on an initial load of 7,067 tons of flour and departed the Pacific Northwest on 15 June. After transiting the Panama Canal, she reached New York on 16 July. On 1 August, "West Alsek" joined Convoy HB-8 with , United States Army cargo transport , and 13 other ships for France.
Escorted by armed yacht , destroyers and , and French cruiser "Marseillaise", the convoy was some west of its destination of Le Verdon-sur-Mer by the end of the day on 15 August. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, one of three torpedoes from German submarine "U-90" struck "Montanan", while another torpedo from "U-107" hit "West Bridge", which was already adrift with engine trouble. Meanwhile, "West Alsek" and the other surviving ships of the convoy continued on and arrived at Verdon-sur-mer on 18 August.
After unloading her cargo of flour and returning to the United States, "West Alsek" next sailed on 27 October in convoy to Quiberon and Nantes. "West Alsek" unloaded her cargo in Nantes from 15 November—four days after the Armistice—to 30 December. Sailing for New York on that date, "West Alsek" arrived there on 19 January 1919. She was decommissioning on 27 January and returned to the USSB.
Civilian career.
Little is known about "West Alsek"s subsequent civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, "West Alsek", still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers without the need for hand-feeding. "West Alsek" entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.
Upon completion of the conversion work, "West Alsek" was taken out for trials over two passes on a course on 19 June. Representatives from the USSB, the Navy Department, the United States Coast Guard, the Cunard Line, and Todd and other shipbuilders were on board—some 125 guests in all. The ship cruised at an average of , some faster than she had ever steamed.
After returning her guests to New York, "West Alsek" sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, becoming the first ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed that in addition to making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, "West Alsek" used about 30% less coal during the voyage. "West Alsek" continued to be a test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.
No information on "West Alsek"s career after the coal pulverizing tests is available, but it is known that she was abandoned by the USSB, and scrapped in the fourth quarter of 1933.

During the term, the Country Party split into rival Ministerial (MCP) and Executive (ECP) factions–although in the Council, this was diluted somewhat by the refusal of some long-standing Country members to become involved in the dispute. The Executive faction, loyal to the Primary Producers' Association, prevailed and by 1925 the Ministerial faction had merged with the Nationalist Party.

National Disasters Management Institute

The National Disasters Management Institute (, INGC) is the disaster relief agency of Mozambique.
History.
The INGC was formed in 1999
by Government decree no. 37
and operates under the Ministry of State Administration (MAE).
Prior to its creation, disaster management in Mozambique was under the purview of the Department for the Prevention and Combat of Natural Disasters (, DPCCN), a subunit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation that mainly served as a "distributing agency for external aid".
In contrast to its predecessor, the INGC was geared more toward coordination of disaster management efforts than delivery of foreign aid.
As of March 10, 2008, Joao Ribeiro was the director of the INGC.
He was formerly the institute's deputy director
and replaced Paulo Zucula, who was "widely praised" for his leadership of the INGC, when Zucula was appointed Minister of Transport and Communication.
Activities.
The INGC is responsible for conducting mitigation efforts (such as collection and analysis of data),
undertaking preparedness measures (e.g. awareness campaigns),
and coordinating disaster response (including distribution of food, tents, and other supplies).
Since June 2008 it is also responsible, through the Reconstruction Coordination Office (GACOR), for the resettlement of persons displaced by natural disasters.
The INGC prepares for and responds to both natural disasters, such as droughts,
floods, and tropical cyclones—the three natural hazards to which Mozambique is most vulnerable—and
man-made disasters, such as the 2008 South Africa riots.
The INGC coordinates disaster management efforts with and receives support from public and private institutions, non-governmental organisations, and international organisations,
including Concern Worldwide,
the government of Germany,
and the United Nations.
Ad Melkert, the Associate Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, which provides assistance to the INGC through its Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery,
lauded the institute in March 2008 as "an example of effective management of natural disasters".
It received "unanimous" praise from international organisations for its response to the 2007 Mozambican flood.

Old Talbott Tavern

The Old Talbott Tavern, also known as the Old Stone Tavern, a historic tavern built in 1779, is located in the Bardstown Historic District of Bardstown, Kentucky, across from the historic Nelson County Courthouse. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 30, 1973. According to tradition, the tavern has never closed since its opening in 1779.
History.
The Old Talbott Tavern was built in 1779, a year before the settlement of Salem (later renamed Bardstown) began, making it the "oldest western stagecoach stop" still in operation. According to an old map of Bardstown, the lot was originally purchased by a man named Hynes; the tavern was called the Hynes Hotel. It was strategically located near the end of the stagecoach road that once led east to Philadelphia and Virginia. George Rogers Clark used it as a resource base during the end of the American Revolutionary War); Daniel Boone stayed here, and the exiled Louis-Philippe of France, stayed at the tavern on October 17, 1797, with a member of his entourage painting murals that were rediscovered in the 20th century and were on display until the 1998 fire.
Visitors in the 19th century included future presidents Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, and Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's parents stayed at the tavern when a court ruling went against them, leading the family to move to Indiana when Lincoln was only seven years old. Other prominent figures who visited the tavern were Henry Clay, the inventor of steamboats John Fitch, environmentalist John James Audubon, songwriter Stephen Foster, and Jesse James, who is said to have been the cause of the bullet holes in the murals as he was drunk and shooting at imaginary butterflies.
George Talbott purchased the tavern in 1886. Within two years, six of his children died in the tavern, included one by falling down the stairs, and another hanging herself after being unlucky in love.
Queen Marie of Romania is known to have lunched at the tavern in 1926. Likewise, World War II general George Patton once visited the tavern.
Throughout its history, the tavern has been called different names: Hynes House, Bardstown Hotel, Chapman's House, Shady Bower Hotel, the Newman House,
Talbott Hotel, Talbott Tavern, and the Old Stone Tavern. The Talbott Tavern was the official name from 1885 to 1968.
On March 7, 1998, a fire damaged the tavern, severely damaging the roof and second floor. The fire also damaged the Louise-Phillippe murals, which have still not been restored. The renovations to repair the fire damage were described as "generic". The Old Talbott Tavern reopened on November 9, 1999.
The old Talbott Tavern currently serves as both a restaurant and a five-room bed and breakfast. A writer for "Travel and Leisure" magazine described it as having "slightly spooky charm". It has been featured on Food Network and Travel Channel, and was once ranked the 13th most haunted inn in the United States.
It is next to the historic Nelson County Jail.
Construction.
The original tavern consisted of the present eastern section, built of stone walls two feet thick and heavy ceiling timbers, with two separate fireplaces to cook the food. It originally had two guest rooms on the second floor: one for men and one for women, as individual rooms for guests did not become widespread in the United States until the early 19th century. The brick western section was built a century later.
