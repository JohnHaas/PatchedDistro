Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (, 28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German writer and politician. His body of work includes epic and lyric poetry written in a variety of metres and styles; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour; and four novels. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him are extant.
A literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Carl August in 1782 after first taking up residence there in November of 1775 following the success of his first novel, "The Sorrows of Young Werther". He was an early participant in the "Sturm und Drang" literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe served as a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace, which in 1998 were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
After returning from a tour of Italy in 1788, his first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship", the verse epic "Hermann and Dorothea", and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, "Faust". His conversations and various common undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have, in later years, been collectively termed Weimar Classicism.
Arthur Schopenhauer cited "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship" as one of the four greatest novels ever written and Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe, along with Plato, Napoleon, and William Shakespeare, as one of six "representative men" in his work of the same name. Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, most notably Johann Peter Eckermann's "Conversations with Goethe". There are frequent references to Goethe's various sayings and maxims throughout the course of Friedrich Nietzsche's work and there are numerous allusions to Goethe in the novels of Hermann Hesse and Thomas Mann as well as in the psychological writings of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Goethe's poems were set to music throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by a number of composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, and Gustav Mahler.
Biography.
Early life.
Goethe's father, Johann Caspar Goethe, lived with his family in a large house in Frankfurt, then an Imperial Free City of the Holy Roman Empire. Though he had studied law in Leipzig and had been appointed Imperial Councillor, he was not involved in the city's official affairs. 38-year-old Johann Caspar married Goethe's mother, Catharina Elizabeth Textor, the daughter of the mayor of Frankfurt Johann Wolfgang Textor and his wife Anna Margaretha Lindheimer, when she was 17 at Frankfurt on 20 August 1748. All their children, except for Goethe and his sister, Cornelia Friederike Christiana, who was born in 1750, died at early ages.
His father and private tutors gave Goethe lessons in all the common subjects of their time, especially languages (Latin, Greek, French, Italian, English and Hebrew). Goethe also received lessons in dancing, riding and fencing. Johann Caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.
Goethe had a persistent dislike of the Roman Catholic Church, and characterized its history as a "hotchpotch of fallacy and violence" ("Mischmasch von Irrtum und Gewalt"). His great passion was drawing. Goethe quickly became interested in literature; Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Homer were among his early favourites. He had a lively devotion to theatre as well and was greatly fascinated by puppet shows that were annually arranged in his home; a familiar theme in "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship".
He also took great pleasure in reading from the great works about history and religion. He writes about this period:
Goethe became acquainted with Frankfurt actors. Around early literary attempts, he was infatuated with "Gretchen", who would later reappear in his "Faust" and the adventures with whom he would concisely describe in "Dichtung und Wahrheit". He adored Charitas Meixner (July 27, 1750 - December 31, 1773), a wealthy Worms trader's daughter and friend of his sister, who would later marry the merchant G. F. Schuler.
Legal career.
Goethe studied law in Leipzig from 1765 to 1768. He detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of Christian Fürchtegott Gellert. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with Anna Katharina Schönkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the Rococo genre. In 1770, he anonymously released "Annette", his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in Lessing and Wieland. Already at this time, Goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy "Die Mitschuldigen". The restaurant Auerbachs Keller and its legend of Faust's 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his closet drama "Faust Part One". As his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.
In Frankfurt, Goethe became severely ill. During the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. In April 1770, Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies in Strasbourg.
In Alsace, Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met Johann Gottfried Herder. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, it was Herder who kindled his interest in Shakespeare, Ossian and in the notion of Volkspoesie (folk poetry). On October 14, 1772 he held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first German "Shakespeare Day". His first acquaintance with Shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.
On a trip to the village Sessenheim, Goethe fell in love with Friederike Brion, in October 1770, but, after ten months, terminated the relationship in August 1771. Several of his poems, like ', ' and "", originate from this time.
At the end of August 1771, Goethe acquired the academic degree of the "Lizenziat" (Licentia docendi) in Frankfurt and established a small legal practice. Although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make jurisprudence progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the court of Darmstadt, where his inventiveness was praised. From this milieu came Johann Georg Schlosser (who was later to become his brother-in-law) and Johann Heinrich Merck. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a noble highwayman from the German Peasants' War. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama. Entitled "Götz von Berlichingen," the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.
Goethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at Wetzlar. In 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, "The Sorrows of Young Werther". The outer shape of the work's plot is widely taken over from what Goethe experienced during his Wetzlar time with Charlotte Buff (1753–1828) and her fiancé, Johann Christian Kestner (1741–1800), as well as from the suicide of the author's friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem (1747–1772); in it, Goethe made a desperate passion of what was in reality a hearty and relaxed friendship. Despite the immense success of "Werther", it did not bring Goethe much financial gain because copyright laws at the time were essentially nonexistent. (In later years Goethe would bypass this problem by periodically authorizing "new, revised" editions of his Complete Works.)
Early years in Weimar.
In 1775, Goethe was invited, on the strength of his fame as the author of "The Sorrows of Young Werther", to the court of Carl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, who would become Grand Duke in 1815. (The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's 26.) Goethe thus went to live in Weimar, where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the Duke's chief adviser.
In 1776, Goethe formed a close relationship to Charlotte von Stein, an older, married woman. The intimate bond with Frau von Stein lasted for ten years, after which Goethe abruptly left for Italy without giving his companion any notice. She was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.
Goethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. Goethe was ennobled in 1782 (this being indicated by the "von" in his name).
Italy.
Goethe's journey to the Italian peninsula from 1786 to 1788 was of great significance in his aesthetic and philosophical development. His father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical art of ancient Greece and Rome. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists Angelica Kauffman and Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, as well as encountering such notable characters as Lady Hamilton and Alessandro Cagliostro (see Affair of the Diamond Necklace).
He also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that "To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything." While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.
Goethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction "Italian Journey". "Italian Journey" only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in Venice. This "gap in the record" has been the source of much speculation over the years.
In the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816 "Italian Journey" inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in George Eliot's "Middlemarch".
Weimar.
In late 1792, Goethe took part in the battle of Valmy against revolutionary France, assisting Duke Carl August of Saxe-Weimar during the failed invasion of France. Again during the Siege of Mainz he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his Complete Works.
In 1794 Friedrich Schiller wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.
In 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress Christiane Vulpius, the sister of Christian A Vulpius, and their son Julius August Walter von Goethe. On 13 October, Napoleon's army invaded the town. The French "spoon guards," the least-disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house. 
The next day, Goethe legitimized their 18-year relationship by marrying Christiane in a quiet marriage service at the court chapel. They already had several children together by this time, including their son, Julius August Walter von Goethe (25 December 1789 – 28 October 1830), whose wife, Ottilie von Pogwisch (31 October 1796 – 26 October 1872), cared for the elder Goethe until his death in 1832. The younger couple had three children: Walther, Freiherr von Goethe (9 April 1818 – 15 April 1885), Wolfgang, Freiherr von Goethe (18 September 1820 – 20 January 1883) and Alma von Goethe (29 October 1827 – 29 September 1844). Christiane von Goethe died in 1816.
Later life.
After 1793, Goethe devoted his endeavours primarily to literature. By 1820, Goethe was on amiable terms with Kaspar Maria von Sternberg.
In 1823, having recovered from a near fatal heart illness, Goethe fell in love with Ulrike von Levetzow whom he wanted to marry, but because of the opposition of her mother he never proposed. Their last meeting in Carlsbad on 5 September 1823 inspired him to the famous "Marienbad Elegy" which he considered one of his finest works. During that time he also developed a deep emotional bond with the Polish pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska.
In 1832, Goethe died in Weimar. He is buried in the Ducal Vault at Weimar's Historical Cemetery.
Eckermann closes his famous work, "Conversations with Goethe", with this passage:
The first production of Richard Wagner's opera "Lohengrin" took place in Weimar in 1850. The conductor was Franz Liszt, who chose the date 28 August in honour of Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749.
Literary work.
The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were "Götz von Berlichingen" (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther" (called "Die Leiden des jungen Werthers" in German) (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the "Sturm und Drang" period which marked the early phase of Romanticism – indeed the book is often considered to be the "spark" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first "best-seller". (For the entirety of his life this was the work with which the vast majority of Goethe's contemporaries associated him). During the years at Weimar before he met Schiller he began "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship", wrote the dramas "Iphigenie auf Tauris" ("Iphigenia in Tauris"), "Egmont", "Torquato Tasso", and the fable "Reineke Fuchs".
To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong "Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years" (the continuation of "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship"), the idyll of "Hermann and Dorothea", the "Roman Elegies " and the verse drama "The Natural Daughter". In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared "Faust Part One", "Elective Affinities", the "West-Eastern Divan" (a collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical "Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit" ("From My Life: Poetry and Truth") which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his "Italian Journey", and a series of treatises on art. His writings were immediately influential in literary and artistic circles.
Goethe was fascinated by Kalidasa's "Abhijñānaśākuntalam", which was one of the first works of Sanskrit literature that became known in Europe, after being translated from English to German.
"Faust Part Two" was only finished in the year of his death, and was published posthumously. Also published after his death was the so-called "Urfaust", the first sketches, made probably in 1773–74.

The short epistolary novel, "Die Leiden des jungen Werthers", or "The Sorrows of Young Werther", published in 1774, recounts an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide. Goethe admitted that he "shot his hero to save himself": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary archetype. The fact that "Werther" ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral—a funeral which "no clergyman attended"—made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide was considered sinful by Christian doctrine: suicides were denied Christian burial with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church. Epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication. What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.
The next work, his epic closet drama "Faust", was to be completed in stages, and only published in its entirety after his death. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. The first operatic version, by Spohr, appeared in 1814, and was subsequently the inspiration for operas and oratorios by Schumann, Berlioz, Gounod, Boito, Busoni, and Schnittke as well as symphonic works by Liszt, Wagner, and Mahler. Faust became the ur-myth of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the Goetheanum staged the world premiere of a complete production of Faust. On occasion, the play is still staged in Germany and other parts around the world.
Goethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed "Innerlichkeit" ("introversion") and represented by, for example, Heine. Goethe's words inspired a number of compositions by, among others, Mozart, Beethoven (who idolised Goethe), Schubert, Berlioz and Wolf. Perhaps the single most influential piece is "Mignon's Song" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: """?" ("Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?").
He is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as "Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him", "Divide and rule, a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one", and "Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from "Faust", such as "", "", or "" have entered everyday German usage.
It may be taken as another measure of Goethe's fame that other well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to him, such as Hippocrates' "Art is long, life is short", which is found in Goethe's "Faust" ("Art is something so long to be learned, and life is so short!") and "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship".
Scientific work.
Although his literary work has attracted the greatest amount of interest, Goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science. He wrote several works on morphology, and colour theory. Goethe also had the largest private collection of minerals in all of Europe. By the time of his death, in order to gain a comprehensive view in geology, he had collected 17,800 rock samples.
His focus on morphology and what was later called homology influenced 19th century naturalists, although his ideas of transformation were about the continuous metamorphosis of living things and did not relate to contemporary ideas of "transformisme" or transmutation of species. Homology, or as Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire called it "analogie", was used by Charles Darwin as strong evidence of common descent and of laws of variation. Goethe's studies led him to independently discover the human intermaxillary bone in 1784, which Broussonet (1779) and Vicq d'Azyr (1780) had (using different methods) identified several years earlier. While not the only one in his time to question the prevailing view that this bone did not exist in humans, Goethe, who believed ancient anatomists had known about this bone, was the first to prove its peculiarity to all mammals.
During his Italian journey, Goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the "leaf" – he writes, "from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other". In 1790, he published his "Metamorphosis of Plants". As one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought, Goethe wrote in "Story of My Botanical Studies" (1831):
The ever-changing display of plant forms, which I have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: The plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given... a felicitous mobility and plasticity that allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.
Goethe also popularized the Goethe Barometer using a principle established by Torricelli. According to Hegel, 'Goethe has occupied himself a good deal with meteorology; barometer readings interested him particularly... What he says is important: the main thing is that he gives a comparative table of barometric readings during the whole month of December 1822, at Weimar, Jena, London, Boston, Vienna, Töpel... He claims to deduce from it that the barometric level varies in the same propoportion not only in each zone but that it has the same variation, too, at different altitudes above sea-level'.
In 1810, Goethe published his "Theory of Colours", which he considered his most important work. In it, he contentiously characterized color as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium. In 1816, Schopenhauer went on to develop his own theory in "On Vision and Colors" based on the observations supplied in Goethe's book. After being translated into English by Charles Eastlake in 1840, his theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably J. M. W. Turner. Goethe's work also inspired the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, to write his "Remarks on Color". Goethe was vehemently opposed to Newton's analytic treatment of color, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive "rational description" of a wide variety of color phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his theory's failure to demonstrate significant predictive validity eventually rendered it scientifically irrelevant. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of color, and his observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel, 'for the colors diametrically opposed to each other... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. (Goethe, "Theory of Colours", 1810). In this, he anticipated Ewald Hering's opponent color theory (1872).
Goethe outlines his method in the essay "The experiment as mediator between subject and object" (1772). In the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, the science editor, Rudolf Steiner, presents Goethe's approach to science as phenomenological. Steiner elaborated on that in the books "The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception" and "Goethe’s World View", in which he characterizes intuition as the instrument by which one grasps Goethe's biological archetype—"The Typus".
Novalis, himself a geologist and mining engineer, expressed the opinion that Goethe was the first physicist of his time and 'epoch-making in the history of physics', writing that Goethe's studies of light, of the metamorphosis of plants and of insects were indications and proofs 'that the perfect educational lecture belongs in the artist's sphere of work'; and that Goethe would be surpassed 'but only in the way in which the ancients can be surpassed, in inner content and force, in variety and depth – as an artist actually not, or only very little, for his rightness and intensity are perhaps already more exemplary than it would seem'.
Eroticism.
Many of Goethe's works, especially "Faust", the "Roman Elegies", and the "Venetian Epigrams", depict erotic passions and acts. For instance, in "Faust", the first use of Faust's power after literally signing a contract with the devil is to fall in love with and impregnate a teenage girl. Some of the "Venetian Epigrams" were held back from publication due to their sexual content. Goethe clearly saw human sexuality as a topic worthy of poetic and artistic depiction, an idea that was uncommon in a time when the private nature of sexuality was rigorously normative.
Religion and politics.
Born into a Lutheran family, Goethe's early faith was shaken by news of such events as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and the Seven Years' War. In July 1782, he described himself as "not anti-Christian, nor un-Christian, but most decidedly non-Christian." In his Venetian Epigram 66, Goethe listed four things that he disliked: "tobacco smoke, bugs and garlic and the cross." In the book "Conversations with Goethe" by Goethe's secretary Eckermann, however, Goethe is portrayed as enthusiastic about Christianity, Jesus, Martin Luther, and the Protestant Reformation, even calling Christianity the "ultimate religion". Although he opposed many of the central teachings of the Christian churches, he thought that he could nevertheless be inwardly Christian.
His later spiritual perspective evolved among pantheism (heavily influenced by Spinoza), humanism, and various elements of Western esotericism, as seen most vividly in Part II of "Faust". According to Nietzsche, Goethe had "a kind of almost "joyous" and "trusting fatalism"" that has "faith that only in the totality everything redeems itself and appears good and justified."
On the other hand, a year before his death, in a letter to Sulpiz Boisserée, Goethe wrote that he had the feeling that all his life he had been aspiring to qualify as one of the Hypsistarians, an ancient Jewish-pagan sect of the Black Sea region. After describing his difficulties with mainstream religion, he mentioned that he had learned of this sect who, hemmed in between heathens, Jews and Christians, declared that they would reverence, as being close to the Godhead, what came to their knowledge of the best and most perfect.
In politics, Goethe was conservative. At the time of the French Revolution, he thought the enthusiasm of the students and professors to be a perversion of their energy and remained skeptical of the ability of the masses to govern. Likewise, he did not oppose the War of Liberation (1813–15) waged by the German states against Napoleon, and remained aloof from the patriotic efforts to unite the various parts of Germany into one nation.
Influence.
Goethe had a great effect on the nineteenth century. In many respects, he was the originator of many ideas which later became widespread. He produced volumes of poetry, essays, criticism, a theory of colours and early work on evolution and linguistics. He was fascinated by mineralogy, and the mineral goethite (iron oxide) is named after him. His non-fiction writings, most of which are philosophic and aphoristic in nature, spurred the development of many philosophers, including G.W.F. Hegel, Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ernst Cassirer, Carl Jung, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Along with Schiller, he was one of the leading figures of Weimar Classicism.
Goethe embodied many of the contending strands in art over the next century: his work could be lushly emotional, and rigorously formal, brief and epigrammatic, and epic. He would argue that classicism was the means of controlling art, and that romanticism was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of German poetry. Even in contemporary culture, he stands in the background as the author of the ballad upon which Disney's The Sorcerer's Apprentice is based.
His poetry was set to music by almost every major Austrian and German composer from Mozart to Mahler, and his influence would spread to French drama and opera as well. Beethoven declared that a "Faust" Symphony would be the greatest thing for art. Liszt and Mahler both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this seminal work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: Doctor Faustus. 
The Faust tragedy/drama, often called ' (the drama of the Germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation. Followers of the twentieth century esotericist Rudolf Steiner built a theatre named the Goetheanum after him—where festival performances of Faust are still performed.
Goethe was also a cultural force, who argued that the organic nature of the land moulded the people and their customs—an argument that has recurred ever since. He argued that laws could not be created by pure rationalism, since geography and history shaped habits and patterns. This stood in sharp contrast to the prevailing Enlightenment view that reason was sufficient to create well-ordered societies and good laws.
It was to a considerable degree due to Goethe's reputation that the city of Weimar was chosen in 1919 as the venue for the national assembly, convened to draft a new constitution for what would become known as Germany's Weimar Republic.
The Federal Republic of Germany’s cultural institution, The Goethe-Institut is named after him, and promotes the study of German abroad and fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on its culture, society and politics.
The literary estate of Goethe in the Goethe and Schiller Archives was inscribed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 2001 in recognition of its historical significance.
Goethe's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was a transition in European sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, the indescribable, and the emotional. This is not to say that he was emotionalistic or excessive; on the contrary, he lauded personal restraint and felt that excess was a disease: "There is nothing worse than imagination without taste". He argued in his scientific works that a "formative impulse", which he said is operative in every organism, causes an organism to form itself according to its own distinct laws, and therefore rational laws or fiats could not be imposed at all from a higher, transcendent sphere; this placed him in direct opposition to those who attempted to form "enlightened" monarchies based on "rational" laws by, for example, Joseph II of Austria or the subsequent Emperor of the French, Napoleon I. A quotation from Goethe's "Scientific Studies" will suffice:
That change later became the basis for 19th-century thought: organic rather than geometrical, evolving rather than created, and based on sensibility and intuition rather than on imposed order, culminating in, as Goethe said, a "living quality", wherein the subject and object are dissolved together in a poise of inquiry. Consequently, Goethe embraced neither teleological nor deterministic views of growth within every organism. Instead, his view was that the world as a whole grows through continual, external, and internal strife. Moreover, Goethe did not embrace the mechanistic views that contemporaneous science subsumed during his time, and therewith he denied rationality's superiority as the sole interpreter of reality. Furthermore, Goethe declared that all knowledge is related to humanity through its functional value alone and that knowledge presupposes a perspectival quality. He also stated that the fundamental nature of the world is aesthetic.
His views make him, along with Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, and Ludwig van Beethoven, a figure in two worlds: on the one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order, and finely crafted detail, which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of the Age of Reason and the neo-classical period of architecture; on the other, seeking a personal, intuitive, and personalized form of expression and society, firmly supporting the idea of self-regulating and organic systems. Thinkers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson would take up many similar ideas in the 1800s. Goethe's ideas on evolution would frame the question that Darwin and Wallace would approach within the scientific paradigm. The Serbian inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla was heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, his favorite poem, and had actually memorized the entire text. It was while reciting a certain verse that he was struck with the epiphany that would lead to the idea of the rotating magnetic field and ultimately, alternating current.

Lamey Island Massacre

The Lamey Island Massacre was the slaughter of aboriginal inhabitants of Hsiao Liuchiu island (then known as "Lamey", "Lamay" or "Gouden Leeuwseylant") off the coast of Taiwan by Dutch soldiers in 1636. The killings were part of a campaign in retaliation for the murder of shipwrecked Dutch sailors in two separate incidents in 1622 and 1631 by natives of the island.
Background.
Two years before the Dutch East India Company established a presence on Taiwan in 1624, a Dutch ship named the "Golden Lion" (Early Modern Dutch: "Gouden Leeuw") was wrecked on the coral reefs of Hsiao Liuchiu, then known to the Dutch as "Lamey" or "Lamay" island. The entire crew was killed by the native inhabitants.
Subsequently in 1631 a yacht named the "Beverwijck" was also wrecked on the treacherous reefs, with survivors (numbering around fifty) battling the Lameyans for two days before being overwhelmed and slaughtered to a man.
Following the murder of the "Gouden Leeuw" survivors, the island was sometimes referred to by the Dutch as "Gouden Leeuwseylant" (Golden Lion Island). There was a desire at the very highest levels of the Dutch East India Company not to let the killings go unpunished, with Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Hendrik Brouwer ordering Governor of Formosa Hans Putmans to "punish and exterminate the people of [...] the Golden Lion Island as an example for their murderous actions committed against our people."
Punitive expedition campaigns.
Putmans was determined to assault Lamey as soon as possible, at one stage requesting that the warriors of Mattau assist them in punishing the islanders. The first expedition arrived in 1633, led by Claes Bruijn and consisting of 250 Dutch soldiers, forty Han Chinese pirates and 250 Aboriginal Formosans. It met with little success, but they did manage to find evidence of the murdered crew of the "Beverwijck", including coins, copper from the ship's galley and a Dutch hat. They also learned that a large cave on the island was used by the natives as a refuge in times of trouble.
In 1636, a larger expedition under Jan Jurriansz van Lingga landed on the island, this time chasing the Lameyans into the cave. The Dutch and their allies proceeded to block up all the entrances, leaving small holes where pans of burning pitch and sulphur were placed. Some of the trapped Lameyans managed to crawl out of the holes, where they were captured by the Dutch force. On May 4, after the poisonous fumes had been constantly produced for eight days (during which the cries of those inside could be clearly heard), the cave grew still and the entrances were unblocked. When soldiers entered to investigate, they found the corpses of around 300 men, women and children who had been suffocated by the fumes.
Aftermath.
The captured men of the island were put to work as slaves in both Taiwan and Batavia. The women and children were put up in the homes of Dutch people in Taiwan as servants; some later became wives for Dutch men.
There were numerous other raids following this expedition until the island was finally completely depopulated in 1645 when a Chinese merchant who had rented rights to the island from the Dutch East India Company removed the last thirteen inhabitants.
Alternate stories.
There have been a number of erroneous accounts of the incident, the most obvious of which is the plaque outside the cave where the massacre occurred.
This account is almost completely false from start to finish, as noted by several writers.

Early political career of Sarah Palin

Sarah Palin was a member of the Wasilla, Alaska city council from 1992 to 1996 and the city's mayor from 1996 to 2002. Wasilla is located 29 miles (47 km) north-east of the port of Anchorage, and is the largest population center in the Mat-Su Valley. At the conclusion of Palin's tenure as mayor in 2002, the city had about 6,300 residents, and is now the fifth largest city in the state. Term limits prevented Palin from running for a third term as mayor.
City council of Wasilla.
Palin was elected twice to the city council of Wasilla, in 1992 and 1995. Wasilla's city councillors serve three-year terms. Palin says she entered politics because she was concerned that revenue from a new Wasilla sales tax would not be spent wisely.
Palin's first foray into politics was in 1992, when the then 28-year-old ran for Wasilla city council against John Hartrick, a local telephone company worker. She won 530 votes against Hartrick's 310. On the council, she successfully opposed a measure to curtail the hours at Wasilla's bars by two hours. This surprised Hartrick because she was then a member of a church that advocated abstinence from alcohol. After serving on the city council for three years, she ran for reelection against R’nita Rogers in 1995, winning 413 votes to Rogers' 185. Palin did not complete her second term on the city council because she ran for mayor in 1996.
Remark about library book.
According to Laura Chase of Wasilla, and former Wasilla mayor John Stein, Palin mentioned in 1995 that she saw the book "Daddy's Roommate" in the public library and did not think that it belonged there. Chase later became Palin's campaign manager for mayor in 1996, when Palin defeated John Stein, but Chase had a falling out with Palin and then became a vocal critic.
City of Wasilla Library records indicate that there was never a request for the library to remove the book and that no books were ever censored or banned. A "New York Times" article in 2008 mentioned the "Daddy's Roommate" episode, and intimated that the episode is relevant to accusations that Palin may be sympathetic to censorship. The "Times" article was subsequently criticized by the "Times own ombudsman for presenting "confusing and incomplete" anecdotes about Palin.
The McCain-Palin campaign said that Palin was not advocating censorship. Eventually, the Wasilla Library did remove the book in question, according to Kathy Martin-Albright who became library director in 2005: "The books were removed as part of ongoing collection development and not due to the subject matter presented in the books."
Duties of mayor.
The duties of Wasilla's mayor are more circumscribed than those of many other mayors in the United States. Firefighting and schools are overseen by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough government, and the state government handles social services and environmental regulation, such as storm water management for building projects. Palin told the "Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman" that she could handle the job of Mayor without any assistance from veteran town officials: "It's not rocket science. It's $6 million and 53 employees."
Campaign for mayor in 1996.
In 1996, Palin had been serving on the city council for four years, and decided to run for mayor. She defeated three-term incumbent mayor John Stein, running on a platform of "fresh ideas and energy".
In the campaign, she vowed to replace "stale leadership" and criticized Stein for wasteful spending and high taxes. She also introduced campaign issues such as abortion, gun rights, and term limits into the race. Although the mayoral election was non-partisan, the state Republican party ran advertisements on her behalf. Palin did not brandish her religious views during that campaign, but did play up her church work. A local cable TV program referred to Palin as Wasilla's first "Christian mayor," which prompted an objection from Stein who noted that he and several previous mayors were Christian.
First term as mayor.
Upon taking office in October 1996, she began to make staffing changes. She eliminated the position of museum director and asked for updated resumes and resignation letters from Wasilla police chief Irl Stambaugh, public works director Jack Felton, finance director Duane Dvorak, and librarian Mary Ellen Emmons. She temporarily required department heads to get her approval before talking to reporters, stating they first needed to become better acquainted with her policies. As promised during her campaign, she reduced her own salary by 10%, from $68,000 to $61,200; she also reduced her workload by hiring a new City Administrator. By 1999, the City Council had raised her salary back to $68,000. In her first term, state Republican party leaders began grooming her for higher office.
Her first months in office were so rocky that there was talk of a recall attempt in 1997, which fizzled. Her recollection was that she "grew tremendously in my early months as mayor". Palin would gain favor with Wasillans. She kept a jar with the names of Wasilla residents on her desk, and once a week she pulled a name from it and picked up the phone. She would ask: "How's the city doing?"
Police department matters.
Stambaugh's dismissal.
Palin gave a signed letter to Police Chief Stambaugh on January 30, 1997 stating: "I do not feel I have your full support in my efforts to govern the city of Wasilla. Therefore I intend to terminate your employment." Palin spoke with Stambaugh at least three times about his continued service, but ultimately he was fired as planned. Stambaugh filed a lawsuit claiming discrimination and that his dismissal was politically motivated. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a court that found the mayor has the right to fire city employees even for political reasons or for no reason at all and ordered Stambaugh to pay $22,000 of Palin's legal expenses.
As mayor of Wasilla, Palin was in charge of the city Police Department, consisting of 25 officers and Chief of Police, Charlie Fannon. She was credited with strengthening the Police Department. She would later come into conflict with Fannon when he ran for political office using campaign ads containing a false endorsement from Palin. Palin actually supported another candidate, Curt Menard.
HB 270.
In 2000, state legislators in Alaska learned that some police agencies were charging rape victims or their insurance companies for forensic medical examination necessary to gather evidence, which can cost $500 to $1200. A bill was proposed to require police departments to cover the cost of the exams and became law later the same year. Fannon responded to the new law by expressing concern about the cost of the rape kits, stating "In the past we've charged the cost of exams to the victim's insurance company when possible. I just don't want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer...Ultimately it is the criminal who should bear the burden of the added costs.". The City of Wasilla Office of the Mayor reported searching records extending "back to the beginning of fiscal year 2000", and "found no record of sexual assault victims billed for forensic exams".
The Wasilla newspaper, "The Frontiersman", conducted an e-mail interview with Palin, comprising fourteen questions:(Frontiersman)"6. During your tenure as mayor in 2000, then police chief Charlie Fannon commented in a May 23, 2000 Frontiersman article about legislation Gov. Tony Knowles signed protecting victims of sexual assault from being billed for rape kits collected by police as part of their investigations. Fannon revealed then that Knowles’ decision would cost Wasilla $5,000 to $14,000 a year, insinuating that the department’s policy was to bill victims for this testing. During your tenure as Mayor, what was the police department and city’s standard operating procedure in recovering costs of rape kits? Were any sexual assault victims ever charged for this testing while you were mayor?"<br>
(Palin)"The entire notion of making a victim of a crime pay for anything is crazy. I do not believe, nor have I ever believed, that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence-gathering test. As governor, I worked in a variety of ways to tackle the problem of sexual assault and rape, including making domestic violence a priority of my administration." Also in 2008, Palin's spokeswoman reiterated her response, adding, "Gov. Palin's position could not be more clear. To suggest otherwise is a deliberate misrepresentation of her commitment to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice."
Library matters.
According to librarian Mary Ellen Emmons, she and Palin discussed the question of library censorship on October 28, 1996. Emmons recalls Palin asking if Emmons would object to censorship, and raising the possibility of people circling the library in protest, to which Emmons replied that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) would get involved. In early December, Palin spoke publicly about the issue, using it as an example of a discussion she'd had with her department heads, stating that "many issues were discussed, both rhetorical and realistic in nature." Anne Kilkenny, a long-time registered Democrat and activist who was at the meeting of October 28, on Palin's statement: "There's no way I thought it was rhetorical". Palin stated that the issue of censorship "was discussed in the context of a professional question being asked in regards to library policy" and that she did not have a specific list of books in mind. "This is different than a normal book-selection procedure or a book-challenge policy," Emmons said. "She was asking me how I would deal with her saying a book can't be in the library."
Emmons stated that she supported the ability of people to challenge the selection and availability of library material according to a set of procedures previously established by the city of Wasilla. She also indicated that this discussion with Palin arose at a time when she was trying to help Wasilla's procedural policies become more similar to those established by the neighboring Mat-Su Borough which Emmons described as "a good process, and almost all public libraries have one." Emmons added that she suspected Palin might encourage a departure from those procedures. From 1986 to 2008, several books acquired by the Wasilla Public Library were challenged by various citizens as poor selections, such as a challenge to "Heather Has Two Mommies" in 1997. None of the challenged books were opposed or removed by Palin.
Palin gave a signed letter to Emmons on January 30, 1997 stating: "I do not feel I have your full support in my efforts to govern the city of Wasilla. Therefore I intend to terminate your employment..." This was the same day Palin gave a similar letter to Police Chief Stambaugh; Emmons as well as Stambaugh had publicly supported Palin's defeated mayoral opponent, John Stein. Palin rescinded the firing of Emmons the next day after meeting with her and after what the "Anchorage Daily News" called "a wave of public support for Emmons." Palin stated that her concerns had been alleviated, and that Emmons agreed to support Palin's plan to merge the town's library and museum operations.
Taxes and spending.
Due to income generated by a 2% sales tax that was enacted prior to her election, Palin was able to cut property taxes by 75% and to eliminate personal property and business inventory taxes. She also secured funding for improvements to the roads and sewers. She reduced spending on the town museum and prevented building of a new library and city hall, while putting in bike paths, and she was able to get funding for storm-water treatment in order to protect the region's many lakes.
Campaign for reelection in 1999.
Palin ran for re-election against Stein in 1999 and was returned to office by a margin of 909 to 292 votes. Palin was also elected president of the Alaska Conference of Mayors.
Palin wore a Buchanan button during a visit by presidential candidate Pat Buchanan in 1999, but Palin was a co-chair on the Alaska campaign of rival presidential candidate Steve Forbes in 2000. Shortly after wearing the Buchanan button, Palin responded to a newspaper article about it: "When presidential candidates visit our community, I am always happy to meet them. I’ll even put on their button when handed one as a polite gesture of respect...The article may have left your readers with the perception that I am endorsing this candidate, as opposed to welcoming his visit to Wasilla." 
Second term as mayor.
Taxes, borrowing and spending.
According to Dianne M. Keller, who served on the city council when Palin was mayor and would later serve as mayor herself, Wasilla's budgets and tax receipts increased during Palin's terms as mayor, but much of that increase was caused by growth of the city. In the last two years of Palin's mayoralty alone, Wasilla's population grew roughly 13%. Democratic activist Anne Kilkenny claimed that during Palin's six years as mayor, general government expenditures increased by over 33%, while city taxes went up by 38%.
The property tax rate fell from 2 mils to .5 mils under Palin. The sales tax rate increased from 2 percent to 2.5 percent (and was changed to include everything, even food purchases), and that increase was approved by voter referendum to pay off the city’s new sports complex. Voters also approved a bond issue for road improvements.
According to PolitiFact, when Palin took office, she inherited a long-term city debt of just over a million dollars and that debt increased to about $25 million by the time she left office. The big-ticket items responsible for the debt were: $14.7 million for the new multi-use sports complex; $5.5 million for street projects; and $3 million for water improvement projects. Because of economic growth, Keller anticipates that Wasilla can stop charging the extra .5 percent sales tax two years sooner than expected.
Sports complex.
During her second term as mayor, Palin introduced a ballot measure proposing construction of a municipal sports center to be financed by the 0.5% sales tax increase. The $14.7 million Curtis D. Menard Memorial Sports Center was built on time and under budget, but cost the city an additional $1.3 million due to an eminent domain lawsuit caused by a failure to obtain legal ownership of the property before beginning construction.
In 2001, the judge hearing the initial property dispute had ruled for the city and the city's attorney advised the city to proceed with construction; subsequently the judge reversed himself and ruled that the city had never signed the proper papers.
CBS News obtained 86 pages of city council documents showing Palin sought to justify the tax increase to fund the sports complex partly because the private sector had not stepped in to fill the gap. She writes that the ice rink offers an opportunity for government to stop social ills like drug abuse and juvenile delinquency before they start.
Federal funding.
During her second term, Palin joined with nearby communities in jointly hiring the Anchorage-based firm of Robertson, Monagle & Eastaugh to lobby for earmarks for Wasilla. The effort was led by Steven Silver, a former chief of staff for Senator Ted Stevens, and the firm secured nearly $27 million in earmarked funds for public and private entities in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, but only $7.95 million of that amount went to the Wasilla city government.
Earmarks from the firm included $500,000 for a youth shelter, $1.9 million for a transportation hub, $900,000 for sewer repairs, and $15 million for a rail project linking Wasilla and the ski resort community of Girdwood. Earmark requests from this firm were criticized by Senator John McCain on three occasions, but Palin was only involved in one of those three.
Mayoral succession.
In 2002, term limits prevented Palin from running for a third term as mayor. Palin's pro-choice Democratic stepmother-in-law, Faye Palin, ran for the office but lost to Republican Dianne Keller, who received Palin's endorsement.
Post-mayoral years.
In 2002, Palin ran for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, coming in second to Loren Leman in a five-way Republican primary. The Republican ticket of U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski and Leman won the November 2002 election. When Murkowski resigned from his long-held U.S. Senate seat in December 2002 to become governor, he considered appointing Palin to replace him in the Senate, but chose his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, who was then an Alaskan state representative.
Governor Murkowski appointed Palin to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. She chaired the Commission beginning in 2003, serving as Ethics Supervisor. Palin resigned in January 2004, protesting what she called the "lack of ethics" of fellow Republican members.
After resigning, Palin filed a formal complaint against Oil and Gas Conservation Commissioner Randy Ruedrich, also the chair of the state Republican Party, accusing him of doing work for the party on public time and of working closely with a company he was supposed to be regulating. She also joined with Democratic legislator Eric Croft to file a complaint against Gregg Renkes, a former Alaskan Attorney General, accusing him of having a financial conflict of interest in negotiating a coal exporting trade agreement, while Renkes was the subject of investigation and after records suggesting a possible conflict of interest had been released to the public. Ruedrich and Renkes both resigned and Ruedrich paid a record $12,000 fine. From 2003 to June 2005, Palin served as one of three directors of "Ted Stevens Excellence in Public Service, Inc.," a 527 group designed to provide political training for Republican women in Alaska. In 2004, Palin told the "Anchorage Daily News" that she had decided not to run for the U.S. Senate that year, against the Republican incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, because her teenage son opposed it. Palin said, "How could I be the team mom if I was a U.S. Senator?"

Lock 18 of Enlarged Erie Canal

Lock 18 of the Enlarged Erie Canal is located off North Mohawk Street in Cohoes, New York, United States. It is made of stone blocks 3 by 2 by 1.5 feet (90 by 50 by 40 cm) in size, roughly in length, laid in a random ashlar pattern. The lock's wooden gates are no longer extant.
The lock was built as part of an 1837-1842 plan to make the canal bed larger, heading off competition from railroads, and allowing a detour around the section of canal between Albany and Schenectady to the south, which had fewer locks and was difficult to navigate. Holmes Hutchinson, a canal engineer who later became chief of that department and a director of several railroads, surveyed the route and drew up the plans for all locks in the mid-1830s. The canal was relocated slightly within the city of Cohoes; North Mohawk Street today parallels the original alignment, with sections of the original canal kept open to provide water power to nearby mill complexes along the Mohawk River.
Ten of the locks from the Enlarged Erie Canal remain within Cohoes. Lock 18 was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, added in 1970 in recognition of the high quality of its remaining stonework; the remainder of the locks on city-owned land were added to the National Register in 2004 as a non-contiguous historic district. A city-owned trail along the former towpath allows visitors to see them. There is also a small parking lot along the street northeast of the lock with an interpretive sign.

Vann Vannak

Vann Vannak was a popular actor in Cambodia during the late 1960s until 1975. Despite his talents, producers usually favored casting his rivals "Kong Som Oeurn" or "Chea Yuthorn" in their movies. Due to their lack of support, Vann Vannak starred in considerably fewer films when compared to his rivals. Nevertheless he was pivotal in movies such as "Sovann Pancha", "Neang Kakey", and "Champa Meas" all which had "Vichara Dany" as the female lead. To increase his presence in the industry he created his own production company known as "Pisnoka" in 1970 which made eight films casting himself as the male lead in all of them.
Details of his life are relatively unknown and he is believed to have perished under the Khmer Rouge regime. Of all the films he's starred in only "Sovann Pancha" is known to have survived and remained intact.

True Adventures

True Adventures, Ltd., is a role-playing game company started by Jeff Martin. It operates two entertainment venues at Gen Con Indy: True Dungeon and True Dungeon Fantasy Tavern. True Adventures is notable because their signature event, True Dungeon, is "the single most popular event" at Gen Con, drawing people to the convention just for it. The event is also notable for its scale; about 3,000 players play in groups of up to eight people (more recently ten) over four days each year. With tickets for each player costing $44 each, or $28 for True Grind, the event grosses about $100,000, a phenomenal amount for a LARP in the United States. The company also hosted the event True Heroes in 2004 and 2005. True Adventures ran these events at Gen Con SoCal when the convention was still in existence. The company grew out of Martin's work in creating elaborate props and puzzles for his Dungeons & Dragons game.
True Dungeon.
Although True Dungeon shares some characteristics with live action roleplaying (LARP) games, the game's developers don't consider it a LARP. While players are free to role-play particular characters, True Dungeon does not emphasize role-playing aspects; characters lack backgrounds and names. Instead characters primarily are collections of spells and statistics useful for solving puzzles and battling opponents. The rules mechanics are loosely based on those of Dungeons & Dragons. Combat is played out by sliding weapon counters along a waist-high shuffleboard table. True Dungeon focuses on riddle and puzzle solving along with the shuffle board combat system.
Jeff Martin originally ran yearly immersive games of this sort for groups of friends. Gen Con owner Peter Adkison was invited to one of these events, then running under the name "Jeff Con" for about 30 people.
After his experience, Adkison invited Martin to run the game at Gen Con after participating in one of Martin's events. True Dungeon was first run at Gen Con Indy in 2003. The first event was arranged at the last minute; there was no promotion and tickets were not in Gen Con's system.
The events takes about 100 volunteers to run. The 2006 event supplies filled two semi-trailers.
Equipment for player characters exists in the form of "treasure tokens". These are marked wooden tokens indicating various pieces of traditional Dungeons & Dragons equipment. Examples include rope, small steel mirrors, weapons, and armor. In 2005 players were given a random weapon and random armor; they were expected to trade within their group to optimize their equipment usage. In 2006 players were given a random bag of 10 tokens. Since the game began players could also purchase additional bags of random tokens. There is a substantial after-market for these tradable tokens on eBay.
True Dungeon provides an interactive environment, complete with multiple solutions to many problems. There are a small number of NPCs as the plot requires. Players move through various rooms in the game world. Each room contains a challenge in either the form of a puzzle, a fight, or both. The puzzles can be very difficult and the game has a high rate of character death, although the game's lethality has dropped over the years. Jeff Martin said of the 2004 Gen Con Indy game that only 20% of characters survived, while in 2005 42% did.
Closer to live action role-playing, players are expected to physically explore their surroundings, not simply describing interactions with the gamemaster Many interactions do require gamemaster interaction, with some details of the environment described to players by the gamemaster assigned to each room.
The first few years, each group of players were accompanied by a gamemaster throughout the dungeon. In 2005, this was switched to having a gamemaster assigned to each room to ensure more consistent rulings for a given room.
To maximize throughput of players, each room of the dungeon has a group of players in it. Groups all advance to the next room simultaneously. As a result, each room has a hard time limit. If players finish early, they must wait for the time limit to expire before advancing. If the players are too slow, they are penalized hit points and are moved into the next room. The plot for each dungeon usually provides a reason for the time limit. One year the plot specified that the characters were fleeing lizardmen. Sometimes the rooms themselves explain the time limit; in 2005 one room had a moving wall that would crush characters who failed to open the locked door into the next room quickly enough.
Player success in True Dungeon (and True Heroes) is tracked in the form of Experience Points. Players with larger numbers of Experience Points (or XP) are given levels. These levels have no impact on the gameplay, but offer benefits outside of the game.
Events.
In 2005 two different adventures were run in parallel: "Battle Below Castle Greyhawk" and "Assault Above Castle Greyhawk". In the last room of one of the adventures players could send a brief message to the other adventure, a clue to help the second party complete their last room. Players were free to play both adventures.
In 2006 two very similar copies of the same adventure, "Escape from the Spider Cult", were run in parallel, effectively doubling the number of slots available for players. The playable classes were also expanded to include Barbarian, Druid, and Monk, in addition to the previous Wizard, Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, Ranger and Bard.
In 2007, again two very similar copies of the same adventure, "Race Across Greyhawk", were run in parallel. But this year, one dungeon was more combat oriented while the other was more puzzle oriented. This year also marked the addition of live monsters to the game including a shambling mound, a medusa, and a stone golem.
2008's adventure was entitled "Hope of the Lost." The plot line had the players infiltrating a temple of Pelor that had been taken over by evil forces. Again two versions were run in parallel, a "combat" version and a "puzzle" version. Like 2005's game, groups on the two paths had to work together at the very end to win. Unlike the 2005 year, the two teams actually joined up in the same room. The puzzle group had to solve a puzzle while the combat group had to fight a monster. Both groups had to succeed to win.
In 2009 True Adventures ran four events. "Five Aspects" was a revised version of the original 2004 game. "Smoak" was a new full length event. "Getting In" was a shorter event. "True Grind" was an all combat event.
In 2010 True Adventures ran three events. "The Evading Hilt" offered 1,500 tickets, "DragonWard" offered 3,000 tickets and the True Grind event offered around 300 tickets.
In 2013 True Adventures ran three events for total of 7,500 tickets available. "Lycans Afoot" available in Puzzle and Combat versions, "Golembane" available in Puzzle and Combat versions, and the True Grind. Lycans Afoot and Golembane offer 4 levels of challenge: Non-Lethal, Normal, Hardcore, and Nightmare.
True Dungeon Fantasy Tavern.
In 2005, True Dungeon added a tavern area in front of the True Dungeon adventures proper. The area is decorated as a stereotypical fantasy tavern. Drinks are available for purchase. The area is intended to be a fantasy-themed area for gamers to congregate and socialize. It also acts as a staging area for players waiting for their session of True Dungeon. A shuffle board is available to practice combat, and many players meet here to trade tokens.
In 2006 players with a ticket for the day's event could enter the tavern. Any player with enough Experience Points to be fourth level could also enter. Anyone else wishing to enter needed to pay a fee.
True Heroes.
True Heroes was a superhero-themed game that is played much like True Dungeon. It was produced in conjunction with Upper Deck Entertainment and Marvel Comics. Combat involved throwing small balls containing magnets at metal targets. Combat also used aspects of Upper Deck's "VS System". True Heroes operated at Gen Con Indy and So Cal in 2004 and 2005 before being cancelled.

Darkon Wargaming Club

The Darkon Wargaming Club is a non-profit battle gaming and live-action role-playing (LARP) club in the United States based in the Washington, D.C. Metro area. 
Founded in 1985 and built upon the rules of the now-defunct "Emarthnguarth Outdoor Wargaming System", Darkon grew from a handful of LARP enthusiasts to almost 2,000 members in 2005, with a small number of chapters dotting the country. 
Darkon is notable for its age and media coverage. The club was featured on two Fox News broadcasts and in a CNN story by Oliver Janney. On June 3, 2009, a segment featuring several members of the Club was featured on National Public Radio. There is also an award-winning feature-length documentary based on the club, "Darkon".
Administration of The Darkon Wargaming Club is composed of three official governing bodies: the "Executive Board," the "Noble Council," and the "Senate." The Club administration is run much like the United States Government, with a system of checks and balances to prevent one body from gaining too much power.
The group has various tie-ins with local park services and other public-grounds administrative bodies, meaning they often have opportunities to set up their events in public parks and nature preserves as well as through personal arrangements with private farmers, landowners, and high school and college grounds.
Club administration.
Executive Board.
The Executive Board of Darkon handles the day-to-day administration of the Club, such as finances, registration, records, and contact with other LARPs. Members of this governing body are the official representatives of the Darkon Wargaming Club. The Board is composed of: 
All Executive Board members are elected annually by the Senate.
Senate.
The Senate of Darkon is made up of one or two representatives from each country (team) in Darkon. Duties of the Senate consist of introducing and voting on new rules and bylaws, electing Executive Board members, and making specific Club decisions. Additionally, the Senate may overrule any official decision made by the Executive Board.
Noble Council.
The Noble Council is a governing body consisting of Club members who have earned the title of "Knight of the Realm" through Club service and high esteem of the Club members. It is this council's task to ensure that safety policies and practices are being performed by Club members at all times, and to discipline those who violate such policies. 
Individual Knights are held to a higher standard and expected to maintain conduct becoming of their rank at all times. Knights are expected to serve as Elders (referees) and safety Marshals periodically throughout the year. Any Knight may challenge the Noble Council in a contest of arms in order to gain a higher title (such as Baron, Earl, Marquis, Count, Duke or Prince) and the right to play the class Cavalier. They may also go up in higher rank via promotion from the High King or the Noble Council.
Those who wish to gain nobility must submit a petition to the Noble Council. Based upon that player's merit, the Council may then accept or deny the applicant. However, Nobles approved by the Noble Council may be decommissioned by the Senate if seen unfit. Additionally, the Noble Council may bestow the title of "Knight Errant" on any Club member. Knights Errant are Nobles in title and must be regarded as such, but they do not have voting rights on the Noble Council.
Gameplay.
Countries and retinues.
Darkon is made up of a number of teams, or "countries". A country is a group of players, usually friends, who have all pledged allegiance to the same leader, agreed to wear the same country symbol, and fight for the same goals. Country rosters are fairly static; players may drift from one country to another, but for the most part, membership in a country is very personal and moving is generally an important decision (as it is in real life).
All countries in Darkon have some type of recorded history. The history may be the actual history of a Medieval or ancient nation (such as Sparta) or may consist of pure fiction. Most countries select a fictional background as it is generally easier to roleplay. Countries also exist on a map kept by the administration of Darkon. Land "hexes" may be discovered and claimed, wars (both land and naval) may be fought, and cities, ships, and other structures may be built. The amount of land a country owns has a direct impact on how much in-game money (represented by gold- and silver-colored metal coins minted by the Club administration) is earned. 
Presently there are sixteen officially recognized countries in Darkon. They are (from oldest to newest):
Elidor, Aquilonia, The Bloody Axe Mercenary Company, Nurgle, Moot, Ched Nasad,
The Northern Kingdoms, Laconia, Legion Exsilium, Chosen Blood, Carcosa, New Mordom, and Kindred.
Other countries may unofficially exist in the realm, but until they petition for recognition by the Club administration they may not claim hexes on — or earn money from — the map, nor engage in a land war.
Nomads are players who have no allegiance to any country. They generally are hired out (i.e. become mercenaries) by a country during an event.
Darkon also allows another form of unit, a Knight's Retinue. A person that has attained the title of Knight in the realm of Darkon may wear their own personal symbol on their tabard and manage their own personal army. The retinue members would all wear the same symbol as the Knight they serve under. Members of a retinue can sign in as any country and be members of any country. Currently there are two officially recognized knights retinue in Darkon: House Dubh (rendered to Marquis Bendore Dubh), and the Temple of Athena (rendered to Lord Absolom).
Weapons.
Darkon is full-contact padded weapons sport and therefore must be guaranteed safe for the players. Individual members of the club are trusted to build his or her own weapons in a manner consistent with the Club rules. The large selection of legal weapons available to players are one-handed swords, two-handed swords, hand axes, battle axes, hammers, clubs, maces, spears, daggers, chained flails, quarterstaves, glaives, and halberds. Bows, crossbows, and specially-built javelins also may be used. At the simplest level, Darkon melee weapons are composed of a firm core with several layers of hard- and soft-cell foam taped or glued to it. Cloth must also cover the blade and pommel of every weapon. As of 2012, the Club has decided to include weapons covered in a soft rubberized coat as an alternative to cloth.
Cores are made using various lightweight-yet-sturdy materials. Common cores are PVC pipe and the more expensive fiberglass. Wood and bamboo cores may only be used for spears. Metal cores are not to be used except with express permission from the Club administration.
Darkon players also use different varieties of foam for their weapons ranging from simple camping mats to high-end industrial foams. Adhesives are also used to keep the foam and core together in one solid weapon; contact cement, double-sided tape, and duct tape are the most common for this purpose.
Javelins are long tubes built using foam and adhesive, containing a ½" PVC or hollow fiberglass core.
Arrows and crossbow bolts are built using an actual arrow or bolt with the head removed. The tip of the arrow shaft is then padded with foam and secured with tape.
Siege engines are also in use in the game of Darkon for specialized battle campaigns. Siege weapons include ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets. While there are currently few specific rules governing the construction of a siege engine in Darkon, all siege engines must be built with the utmost degree of safety in mind. Ballista bolts are built much like javelins, while catapult/trebuchet stones are cloth balls filled with cotton fiber, known as "spellballs" (please see the Magic section of this article for more information about spellballs.)
Armor and shields.
Armor and shields in Darkon afford a player special protections against physical and magic damage. Armor may either be built by the player or bought (provided they follow the official specifications and safety guidelines), and can range from a basic leather bracer or greave to full plate mail. In Darkon, leather armor must be at least 5-ounce genuine leather (Pleather is not acceptable) and metal armor be made of steel, brass, or bronze. Damage taken while wearing armor is determined by the type of weapon versus the class of armor worn. For example, chain mail (Armor Rating 2) worn on the torso would give the player one extra hit versus a "black weapon" (i.e., two-handed sword, halberd, "black" glaive, or battle axe), and the second hit would result in a mortal wound. 
Shields are ½" pieces of plywood (¼" for bucklers) wrapped in hard- and soft-cell foam and covered with cloth. Any weapon (save for the "Arrow of Piercing" relic) may be deflected by a shield and cause no damage as long as the weapon does not solidly strike the individual before or after contact with the shield. Shields may be destroyed by a halberd, certain-sized two-handed axes, or via the "Mace of Disruption" relic in three solid hits, or the "Javelin of Lightning" relic in one hit. Additionally, certain magic spells such as "Warp Wood" or "Lightning Bolt" destroy shields.
Shields may block some spells (i.e. "Word of Holding") but not others (i.e. "Curse").
Magic.
Like most fantasy role-playing games, Magic is used in Darkon as part of the fantasy spirit of the game. Magic takes place in the form of spells, written by the player, which must be read in order for the spell to be invoked. Spells may be offensive (i.e., "Fireball"), defensive (i.e., "Cure Light Wounds"), or utility (i.e., "Hold Portal") in nature. Most spells that affect other characters utilize a "spellball," which is a round cloth ball stuffed with cotton fiber. The color of the spellball determines the magic's effect. For example, a Mage could read the "Lightning Bolt" spell from his or her spellbook, then throw a blue spellball at his or her target. If the target is hit, he or she takes a specific amount of damage to the area of the body hit. Every spell is different and it is the player's responsibility to know the effect of every spell.
Green damage spellballs are used specifically with siege engines in the game, and causes immediate "death" to any player directly hit by it. Those within a three-foot radius of the spellball's landing point are "mortally wounded," which is to say he or she becomes incapacitated for 5 minutes and will "die" if not properly healed. It should be noted the green spellsballs are also used in the Druid spell ""Nature Love"".
Roleplaying.
Roleplaying, or "acting out one's character" is a prominent part of Darkon. Players may elect to roleplay a valiant nobleman, a cutthroat rogue, a chaotic abomination of some magic-twisted species, or anywhere in between. Additionally, all players choose a race for their character, be it relatively mundane (e.g., human), literary (e.g., elf, dwarf, sprite) or godlike in power (e.g., storm giant). Race may play a large part of a character's motivations in Darkon. For example, one who has chosen a Drow would usually roleplay as a member of an evil and treacherous race of elves whose sole ambition is money and status.
There are no set rules for roleplaying. Darkon contains a large spectrum of players, from those who play entirely for the competition of the fight and do not engage in roleplay, to those who do not fight at all and spend the majority of their time in the game roleplaying their character.
Furthermore, a player is in no way required to reveal his or her personal agenda or background to another player, though it is generally considered good form to truthfully respond when a player asks, "What do I see?" Players may outright answer or simply give a short visual description of themselves.
During "Adventure" events, plots are put into place in which the countries of Darkon work together (or against each other) to fulfill a quest, solve a puzzle, and/or defeat an enemy. Roleplaying is of particular importance at these events, as the overall "plot" of Darkon exists from one Adventure event to the next. Roleplaying still exists in "Battle" events (events where no plot is outlined; members simply fight), though to a much lesser degree.
Culture.
Members of the Darkon Wargaming Club come from all walks of life, yet a strong sense of camaraderie exists regardless of background, social status, or any other factor. One thread usually common to all members, though, is a hobby for gaming in general, whether it be video games, tabletop role-playing games, or others. 
Some players who meet in Darkon often end up becoming lifelong friends. Darkon has also been responsible for the occasional marriage or two.
As with most other subcultures, Darkon utilizes a vocabulary of slang borne of all live-action roleplaying games. "Rhinohiding" (the act of "blowing off" one's hits; also known as "ego armor"), "powergaming" (splitting hairs in the rules in order to gain an advantage), and "metagaming" (using out-of-game knowledge in-game in an advantageous fashion) are a few examples.

Piero Strozzi (composer)

Piero (or Pietro) Strozzi (1550 - after 1 September 1609) was an Italian nobleman and amateur composer. 
A member of the powerful Strozzi family, Piero was born and died in Florence, where he played an important intellectual role in fostering the "new music" during the late 16th century. He was a member of the Camerata of Count Giovanni de' Bardi and a member of the Camerata of Jacopo Corsi. He was supportive of Giulio Caccini and commissioned several works by the composer. Among his compositions are several madrigals and one opera, "La mascherata degli accecati" (1596).

Industry of Pakistan

! Global<br> ranking !! Company Name 
Pakistan ranks forty-first in the world and fifty-fifth worldwide in factory output.
Pakistan's industrial sector accounts for about 24% of GDP. Cotton textile production and apparel manufacturing are Pakistan's largest industries, accounting for about 66% of the merchandise exports and almost 40% of the employed labour force. [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf] Cotton and cotton-based products account for 61% of export earnings of Pakistan. The consumption of cotton increased by 5.7% over the past five years while the economic growth rate was 7%. By 2010 the spinning capacity increased to 15 million spindles and textile exports hit 15.5$ billion. Other major industries include cement, fertilizer, edible oil, sugar, steel, tobacco, chemicals, machinery and food processing.
The government is privatizing large-scale parastatal units, and the public sector accounts for a shrinking proportion of industrial output, while growth in overall industrial output (including the private sector) has accelerated. Government policies aim to diversify the country's industrial base and bolster export industries.
Mining and quarrying.
The country has immense reserves of various minerals and natural resources. Important minerals found in Pakistan are gypsum, limestone, chromites, iron ore, rock salt, silver, gold, precious stones, gems, marble, copper, coal, graphite, sulphur, fire clay, silica. The salt range in Punjab Province has the largest deposit of pure salt found anywhere in the world. Balochistan province is a mineral-rich area having substantial mineral, oil and gas reserves which have not been exploited to their full capacity or fully explored, recent government policies have begun to develop this region of the country and to tap into the immense resources found there. The province has significant quantities of copper, chromite and iron, and pockets of antimony and zinc in the south and gold in the far west. Natural gas was discovered near Sui in 1952, and the province has been gradually developing its oil and gas projects over the past fifty years.
Major reserves of copper and gold in Balochistan's Reko Diq area have been discovered in early 2006. The Reko Diq mining area has proven estimated reserves of 2 billion tons of copper and 20 million ounces of gold. According to the current market price, the value of the deposits has been estimated at about $65 billion, which would generate thousands of jobs.
The discovery has ranked Rekodiq among the world's top seven copper reserves. The Rekodiq project is estimated to produce 200,000 tons of copper and 400,000 ounces of gold per year, at an estimated value of $1.25 billion at current market prices. The copper and gold are currently traded at about $5,000 per ton and $600 per ounce respectively in the international market.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province accounts for at least 78% of the marble production in Pakistan. Pakistan is home to some of the most finest and purest grades of marble, granite and slate found in the world. Much of the grades A Marble that is exported out of European countries like Italy actually have their origins in Pakistan which previously lacked fine polishing and processing machinery. The Government has taken steps to invest in this crucial sector with the recent establishment of a "Marble City" within Balochistan. [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf]
The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs.211,851 million in 2005 thus registering over 99% growth since 2000. [http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/statistics/national_accounts/table4.pdf]
Fuel extraction industry.
Pakistan's first oil field was discovered in the late 1952 in Balochistan near a giant gas field at Sui in Balochistan. The Toot oilfield was discovered in the early 1960s Islamabad in the Punjab. Production has steadily increased since then. [http://www.pakpositive.com/2005/01/06/canadian-firm-to-develop-pakistan-oilfield/]
Pakistan's first gas field was the giant gas field at Sui in Balochistan which was discovered in the late 1952.
[http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/ContentInfo.jsp?DivID=49&cPath=768_867&ContentID=5217]
Pakistan is also a major producer of Bituminous coal, Sub-bituminous coal and Lignite. Coal mining started in the British colonial era and has continued to be used by Pakistani industries after independence in 1947. [http://islamabad.usembassy.gov/pakistan/h07091701.html]
[http://www.pakistaneconomist.com/database2/cover/c2001-41.asp]
Pakistan produced about 45 tonnes of Uranium in 2006. [http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html]
Manufacturing.
In FY 2002-03, real growth in manufacturing was 7.7%. In the twelve months ending 30 June 2004, large-scale manufacturing grew by more than 18% compared to the previous twelve-month period. The textile and garment industry's share in the economy along with its contribution to exports, employment, foreign-exchange earnings, investment and value added make it Pakistan’s single largest manufacturing sector. The industry comprises 453 textile mills: 50 integrated units; and 403 spinning units, with 9.33 million spindles and 148,000 rotors, The capacity utilization was 83% for spindles and 47% for rotors during 2003. [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf]
The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued large-scale manufacturing at Rs.981,518 million in 2005 thus registering over 138% growth since 2000 [http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/statistics/national_accounts/table4.pdf] while small-scale manufacturing was valued at Rs.356,835 million in 2005 thus registering over 80% growth since 2000.
Technology.
Pakistan has huge potential for the technology industry, which includes software development and electronics manufacturing. Pakistan Aeronautical Complex recently started manufacturing of Tablet PCs, Ebook readers and notebooks in collaboration with INNAVTEK of China. Software development also has a huge potential, which is being utilized as a result of numerous projects initiated by the Government of Pakistan.
Construction.
After the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake Pakistan has instituted stricter building codes. The cost of construction in Pakistan will increase 30 to 50% due to implementation of a new building code which requires strengthening of structures to withstand earthquake of 8 to 8.5 magnitude. The demand for cement has increased due to reconstruction after the earthquake. The price of cement has increased by 50% and Pakistan government banned export of cement to lower the prices and the reconstruction costs.
Dubai Ports World, announced on June 1, 2006 that it will spend $10 billion to develop transport infrastructure and real estate in Pakistan. Dubai Ports World is also discussing the possibility of the company taking over operational management of Gwadar port in Balochistan.
Emaar Properties, announced on May 31, 2006 three real estate developments in the cities of Islamabad and Karachi in Pakistan. The projects, with a total investment of $2.4 billion, will include a series of master planned communities that will set new benchmarks in commercial, residential and retail property within Pakistan.

Electricity, gas and water supply.
Pakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable natural gas reserves, some proven oil reserves, coal (Pakistan has the fourth-largest coal reserves in the world), and a large hydropower potential. However, the exploitation of energy resources has been slow due to a shortage of capital and domestic political constraints. Domestic petroleum production totals only about half the country's oil needs, and the need to import oil has contributed to Pakistan's trade deficits and past shortages of foreign exchange.
The current government has announced that privatization in the oil and gas sector is a priority, as is the substitution of indigenous gas for imported oil, especially in the production of power. Pakistan is a world leader in the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) for personal automobiles.
The short-term national energy demand has expanded significantly since 2001 due to massive rise in sales of durable goods like refrigerators, washing machines, split air conditioners, "et al.". [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5338402.stm]
In 2004, Access Group International announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next 5 years in solar cell manufacture and wind farms. MOUs have been signed with Alternate Energy Development Board. In early 2005, the government approved a 25-year Energy Security Plan to boost electric capacity eightfold. [http://pakistantimes.net/2005/03/23/business4.htm

FH-88

The FH-88 or Field Howitzer 88 was the first locally-designed howitzer developed for the Singapore Army. It is a 155 mm/39-calibre towed howitzer gun.
Development.
Ordnance Development and Engineering of Singapore (ODE, now Singapore Technologies Kinetics) began development of the FH-88 in 1983 with five prototypes being produced over a period of four years. These were followed by a preproduction batch of six 155 mm FH-88 gun-howitzers that incorporated a number of improvements as a result of trials with the prototype weapons. First production FH-88s were completed in 1987, with the weapon becoming operational with the Singapore Army the following year replacing the Soltam M-71.

Herringbone seating

A Herringbone seating arrangement describes the positioning of seats partially and equally askew in one direction. As the name suggests, the arrangement of the seats looks very similar to the skeleton of a fish, and has been called "fish-bone seats" in a few languages.
The term is derived from the arrangement of interlocking brickwork, and has been applied for seating found in aircraft, buses and theatres.
Herringbone seating is increasingly being adopted in the first and business class section of airlines, including Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific (being phased out with newer Sicma Cirrus seat), Delta Air Lines, Qantas, Jet Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Herringbone seats may also include ottomans, and some have the ability to convert into a full flat beds.
Herringbone seating allows all passengers to have direct access to an aisle, and provides increased privacy. However passenger access to a window may be limited. To maintain cost economies airlines may compromise seat width for seat length, leading some passengers to feel as if their seats are narrow, claustophobic cubicles.

Jules C. Silber

Jules Crawford Silber was a German spy working as a censor with the United Kingdom, during the World War One
He was born in Breslau, Silesia.
Biography.
While being based on the autobiographical account of Silber published in 1932 in Germany, Ronald Seth wrote, under the title of "The Spy Who Wasn't Caught", a work astounding reporting the exploits of this fabulous Master of forgotten espionage because it was probably most intelligent of all. Information of this article comes from the French version of this book published in 1968 pennies the title of "the Most English of the German spies".
Little is known of Silber's early life, the names of his parents, his birth date and his place of birth. When he was conscripted into the British Army in 1915 in the United Kingdom, he declared “to have exceeded about thirty years of age”. This would place his birth date at sometime around 1870. As a Teenager, he departed Germany for South Africa where he learned to speak English, Afrikaans, and Zulu.
During the Second Anglo-Boer War, the British used his services as an interpreter and agent of the censure. 1,500 prisoners of war were sent to Ceylon and in India, Silber accompanied them as an agent for the censure for 18 months. He was stationed in the city-garrison of Abbottabad, not far from the Afghan border. Following the Treaty of Vereeniging, the repatriation of the prisoners, began and Silber returned to South Africa where he resided for 2 years.
He later emigrated to the United States. Silber lived there for a few years. In 1914, war was declared between the United Kingdom and Germany. This awoke Silber's patriotism. Thinking of the best way of helping his native land, he decided to travel to the United Kingdom, where he would offer his services to the post office as a censor. With this position, he could obtain information, useful to the German war effort. While in New York, he gave the address of letter-box to the German ambassador.
Not holding a Passport to go to London, he traveled through Canada, where security was more lax, because Canadians were considered to be British citizens. Carrying official British documents that showed his service in South Africa and India, none of which mentioned his nationality, but bearing his true name, he spent some time in Montreal while trying to pass as French Canadian to fool the British.
He set sail for England on September 19, 1914, arriving 10 days later without a passport and was interrogated in Manchester. Eventually he was permitted to enter the United Kingdom and traveled to London later that evening. Although he had yet to commit any acts of espionage, he had already carried out an exploit, because he was a German who had managed to get into the United kingdom during the war. 
The thwarting the investigations of MI5, he obtained an employ at the office of the censure, after an interview with an old man Colonel having already been used for the Punjab region. They were discovered several common relations and Silber began its work of critic then on October 12, 1914.
Using mailed window envelopes, therefore stamped, it forwarded to Germany Microfilm or letters abounding in increasingly important information, because it was regularly promoted. It culminated in the hierarchy while becoming chief censor, which enabled him to analyze all the suspect documents handed by his employee.
Once the war ended, Silber had to wait until 1925 so that the restrictions concerning the continental voyages are reduced to be able to return to his home country.
He finished his days in Germany after having written an autobiographical account of his life in 1932.

Franklin Pierce Burnham

Franklin Pierce Burnham (October 30, 1853 – December 16, 1909) was an American architect. He is best known for his collaborations with Willoughby J. Edbrooke, especially the 1889 Georgia State Capitol. Burnham was also named the Kenilworth Company Architect for Kenilworth, Illinois, and thus designed several of the planned community's original structures. After 1903, Burnham focused his works on California, including a series of twelve Carnegie libraries. Five of his buildings are today recognized by the National Park Service on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Capitol, a National Historic Landmark.
Biography.
Franklin Pierce Burnham was born in Rockford, Illinois on October 30, 1853, to Paul and Sarah J. Burnham. Burnham is of no relation to fellow Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. He was the youngest of their five children, and the only one born in Illinois. Paul Burnham was a carpenter, which probably influenced Franklin's future profession. Franklin Burnham was educated at Old Moseley School in Chicago before working in the architectural offices of J. H. Barrows when he was fourteen. On January 29, 1877, Burnham married Adelia S. Milliken. After the marriage, the couple would move to San Francisco, where Burnham planned to opened a new practice. One of his commissions, with Chicago architect Willoughby J. Edbrooke, was for the Wesley Avenue School at the University of Notre Dame in 1879. Burnham's first son, John Paul, was born in 1883.
At some point around 1887, the Burnhams returned to Chicago. He established a working relationship with Edbrooke in the Chamber of Commerce Building. Burnham was the chief designer while Edbrooke oversaw general management. They designed residences in Evanston, Chicago, and Kansas City. They were also commissioned by the Young Men's Christian Association to design a building in Atlanta for $100,000. It was in Atlanta that Edbrooke & Burnham would receive their most notable commission a few years later—the Georgia State Capitol. A national competition was held for the building, which had to only use materials from Georgia. The Renaissance and Classical Revival design submitted by Edbrooke & Burnham was announced as the winner, and the cornerstone was dedicated on September 2, 1885. The building would be completed in June 1889 for $998,157, in line with the $1 million budget. In 1974, the Georgia State Capitol would become the forty-third National Historic Landmark in the state. Edbrooke & Burnham's 7th District Police Station, built in Chicago in 1888, would be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996.
Burnham was independently appointed the Kenilworth Company Architect in 1889. Kenilworth, Illinois was a planned community by Joseph Sears who sought to develop a Chicago suburb with large lots and high standards of construction. He designed several residences, a train station, and a church for the town. The Mr. J. William de Coursey O'Grady House at 149 Kenilworth Avenue would be listed on the NRHP in 2008. Burnham himself would live in one of his Kenilworth houses at 37 Kenilworth Avenue.
Burnham assumed all responsibility for the practice after Edbrooke was appointed Supervising Architect of the Treasury in 1891. In 1892, the firm designed the Kane County Courthouse in Geneva, Illinois. One of the pair's last major commissions was for the Mecca Flats in Chicago. The apartment building held almost five hundred residents, and was designed in an unusual U-shape that allowed for a central courtyard. This courtyard design would become the template for Chicago apartment design over the next few decades. Burnham contributed the Cold Storage Warehouse for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. The partnership officially ended upon the death of Edbrooke in 1896. Burnham returned to California in 1898 to again open an independent practice.
While in California, Burnham focused his practice on designing Carnegie libraries. He designed twelve libraries; nine on his own, and three as part of the firm of Burnham & Bliesner. Only three are still standing, two of which are recognized by the NRHP. The library in Oxnard, California, now the Carnegie Art Museum, was listed in 1971. The Carnegie Public Library Building in Colton was listed in 1988. Burnham was also commissioned to design the Riverside County Courthouse in Riverside in 1903. He designed San Diego's first skyscraper, the twelve-story First National Bank of San Diego, in 1909. One of his last commissions was the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Pasadena. 
Franklin Pierce Burnham died at noon on December 16, 1909, at the age of 56. At the time, he resided at 1945 La France Street in South Pasadena.

Electricity sector in Pakistan

Electricity in Pakistan is generated, transmitted, distributed, and retail supplied by two vertically integrated public sector utilities: Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) for all of Pakistan (except Karachi), and the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) for the city of Karachi and its surrounding areas. There are around 20 independent power producers that contribute significantly in electricity generation in Pakistan.
For years, the matter of balancing Pakistan's supply against the demand for electricity has remained a largely unresolved matter. Pakistan faces a significant challenge in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity. Pakistan's electricity producers are now seeking a parity in returns for both domestic and foreign investors which indicates it to be one of the key unresolved issues in overseeing a surge in electricity generation when the country faces growing shortages.
As of 2013 massive long-standing electricity shortages continued with long-standing failure to provide reliable service and rampant corruption being met by public protests, unauthorized connections, and refusal by consumers to pay for intermittent service. Electricity generation in Pakistan has shrunk by up to 50% in recent years due to an over-reliance on fossil fuels. Pakistan was hit by its worst power crisis in 2007 when production fell by 6000 Megawatts and massive blackouts followed suit. Load Shedding and power blackouts have become severe in Pakistan in recent years. The main problem with Pakistan's poor power generation is rising political instability, together with rising demands for power and lack of efficiency. Provincial and federal agencies, who are the largest consumers, often do not pay their bills. China, India, Central Asia, and Iran have been offering to export electricity to Pakistan at subsidized rates but the government of Pakistan has not yet responded to the offers for unknown reasons.
Installed capacity.
There are four major power producers in country: WAPDA (Water & Power Development Authority), KESC (Karachi Electric Supply Company), IPPs (Independent Power Producers) and PAEC (Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission).
The break-up of the installed capacity of each of these power producers (as of Jan-2012) is as follows:
WAPDA Hydel
WAPDA Thermal 
WAPDA’s total hydel and thermal capacity is 11,272 MW. Hydel electricity generated by WAPDA varies between two extremities, i.e., between minimum of 2,414 MW and maximum of 6,761 MW depending upon the river flow.
Karachi Electric Supply Company
KESC total generation capacity is 1756 MW.
Independent Power Producers (IPPs)
Total generation capacity of IPPs is 7070 MW.
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission
Total electricity generated from PAEC is 852 MW.
The total power generation capacity of Pakistan is 21,143 MW and the electricity demand (as of April 2010) is 14,500 MW and PEPCO is merely generating 10,000 MW.
Effects of natural and man-made disasters.
During 2010 Pakistan floods and 2005 Kashmir earthquake power stations, power distribution and transmission and other energy infrastructures were damaged. During the floods and rainfalls the recently constructed Jinnah hydroelectric power plant was flooded in addition to severe damages to transmission and distribution network and installations while several power plants and refineries were threatened by rising waters and had to be shut down. Natural gas field output had to be reduced as the flood waters approached the wells. There has also been some concern by Pakistani nuclear activists over the effect of natural disasters on nuclear plants specially over the Chashma Nuclear Power Complex, since the plant lies over a geological fault.
Due to over reliance of Pakistan on dams for electricity generation, some environmental impacts of dams such as submergence of usable/ecological land and their negative impact on Pakistan's mangrove forests due to loss of river silt load, as well as increased risk of severe floods have become evident.

Life of Franz Liszt

Franz Liszt (October 22, 1811 – July 31, 1886) was a 19th-century composer, virtuoso pianist and teacher who became well known throughout Europe for his excellent piano performing skills.
Origin.
Franz Liszt was born on October 22, 1811, in the village of Raiding () in the Kingdom of Hungary, then part of the Habsburg Empire (and since 1920 also part of Austria), in Sopron County (). Liszt was the only child of Adam Liszt and Anna Lager. Anna Lager was half Austrian and half Bavarian. Liszts god-parents were Magyars: Franciscus Zambothy and Julianna Szalay. Liszt was baptized Franciscus, the Latin version of the name Franz or Ferenc. The main language in that region was German, while only a small minority could speak and understand Hungarian. For official purposes Latin was used. Children had only had lessons in Hungarian since 1835. Liszt himself became fluent in German, French and Italian. He also had some knowledge of English, but his knowledge of Hungarian was very poor. In the early 1870s, Liszt also tried to learn it, but after some lessons he gave up.
The issue of Liszt's nationality has triggered a few interpretations. The question is considered by some to be controversial to this day, since important sources are missing. According to the mainstream literature about Liszt, his great grandfather Sebastian List was a German who came to Hungary in the early 18th century. This is according to Walker, but other sources mention Sebestyén born in Rajka, Sopron county, Kingdom of Hungary, about 1703. Since in Hungary the nationality of a child was inherited from the father's side, Liszt's grandfather Georg List and Liszt's father Adam List would have been Germans too if Sebastian would have immigrated from Austria. On the other hand, the theory of Sebastian List's German origin is an assumption without sufficient proof in sources. During the 1930s, Ernő Békefi searched in Hungarian archives for Sebastian List's birth certificate. Since he could not find it, he presumed that Sebastian List must in his youth have come to Hungary. However, Sebastian List's birth certificate has not been found in German or Austrian archives either. Since during the 18th century many materials in Hungarian archives were destroyed by the Ottoman Turks, it can be imagined that this was the reason Békefi could not find Sebastian List's birth certificate – Sebastian List might therefore have been born in Hungary. According to Lina Ramann, Sebestyens father was an officer of lower rang at a Hussar-regiment and died at Rajka.
In the vast majority of Liszt literature he is regarded as either Hungarian or German. Many authors, among them Émile Haraszti and Béla Bartók, regarded the character of Liszt's music as mainly French. Liszt, since 1838 at least, insisted that he was Hungarian. Liszt and his father Adam only ever had Hungarian passports. Furthermore his children bore Hungarian citizenship as well. In an 1845 letter to the abbot Lamennais, Liszt wrote: "My children bear their father's nationality. Whether they like it or not they are Hungarians". One also has to note that the name "Liszt" means "flour" in Hungarian.
There might be a family connection to the baronial Listi family of László Liszti who lost all their fortunes but before had a castle at Köpcsény (Kittsee) in the area where the composer's family actually lived. Liszt himself tried to prove a relation to this family. Lina Ramann wrote about this probable family connection in her biography.
The first known Liszt (Listi) was a certain Kristóf from Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary. He had three sons: Sebestyén, born in Nagyszeben (Sibiu or Herrmanstadt)), András and János. They were ennobled in 1554. János was baron of Köpcsény and died in Prague in 1577. He married Lucretia Oláh and became bishop of Győr. They had children: János, István and Ágnes.
Ferenc Liszti (baron of Köpcsény was an advisor to Gabriel Bethlen. He had a son László Liszti (born 1628 in Nagyszeben, executed 1662 in Vienna) who was a poet. There was also one Sámuel List, born in Késmárk who became a medical doctor at the university of Nagyszombat in 1777.
Other Liszts, with the spelling List are described by Hungarian author István Csekey in his Liszt biography. These lived in Sopron, western Hungary, and some are already from the beginning of the 15th century. List means treeleaf in Croatian and Slovakian, which is one of the reasons to Slavic claims. Croatia and what later became Slovakia was up to 1920 parts of the Hungarian Kingdom. Liszt means flour in Hungarian.
The earliest form of his name appears to be Listhius, which Kuhac claims with some plausibility as Slavonic ("nase gore list"). But as early as 1747 the Magyarised form appears in the person of Canon Johann Liszt; and there can be little doubt that by the time of the pianist's birth the family had become thoroughly Hungarian. There are, of course, many Hungarian families in which Magyar and Slavonic strains are united, and in the music of Liszt the Magyar element unquestionably predominates. The earliest spelling of "Liszt" was a Stephani (István) Liszt by Miklós Oláh (Nicolaus Olahus).Per magnificam olim Dominam Susannam Gyulaffy, Magnifici condam Domini Stephani Liszty relictam viduam Valentino Szenté donatum. Per eum viro Celsissimo Dominó Comiti Paulo Eszterhazi, hodic concordi imiversorum Statuum et Ordinum voto et desiderio in Regni Hungáriáé Palatimim electo tamquam libri huius Dominó proprietario restitutus et luimillime presentatus per Valentinum Szenté manu propria.</ref>
The German Lina Ramann, who wrote the first biography, credits Liszt as an ethnical Hungarian. Another biographer, the German national-socialist Peter Raabe, wrote that Liszts German origin could not be proved. Liszts compatriot composer Béla Bartók said that according to the prevailing documents it was impossible to tell if Liszt's origin was German, slav or magyar, The Croatian Kuhac claimed plausible Slavonic (i.e. Slavic from Slavonia, then in the Kingdom of Hungary) origin. Sir William Henry Hadow wrote that Liszt was an ethnical Hungarian. In Walker' s Liszt family-tree there are also Germanized Magyar names (Schandor instead of Sándor) as there are Germanized Slavic ones (Schlesak instead of Slezak) to add to the general confusion. The German-Magyar battle over Liszt started first after WW1, when Váralja/Burgenland became Austrian. During the national-socialist era (1933–1945) most German biographers claimed Liszt to be German. Liszt considered himself Hungarian, wrote in 1873: "It must surely be conceded to me that, regardless of my lamentable ignorance of the Hungarian language, I remain from birth to the grave, in heart and mind, a Magyar." Liszt also wrote: "I too belong to that strong and ancient race, I too am a son of that original an undaunted nation..."
Early life.
Every attempt to describe Liszt's development during his childhood and early youth has met with the difficulties of terribly sparse information. It had been Adam Liszt's own dream to become a musician. He played piano, violin, cello, and guitar, was in the services of Prince Nikolaus II Esterházy and knew Joseph Haydn, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Ludwig van Beethoven personally. Franz Liszt, as a mature artist, frequently said himself that the most important musical impressions of his childhood had been the playing of Gypsy artists. However, the actual repertoire that he studied as a boy at the piano was different. According to Adam Liszt's letter to Prince Esterházy of April 13, 1820, he had bought 1,100 "Bogen", i.e. 8,800 pages, of music of the best masters. During the previous 22 months, his son already had worked through the complete works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Clementi, Hummel, Cramer, and further composers besides.
In October 1820, at the old casino of Ödenburg, he took part in a concert of the violinist (alleged) Baron von Praun, who was a child prodigy himself. In the second part of the concert, Liszt played a concerto in E flat major by Ferdinand Ries with much success and an improvisation of his own."Ferenc Liszt" p. 81. Playing a concerto usually meant playing only the first movement. In November 1820 Adam Liszt took up an even better opportunity to present his son's playing to the public. In Pressburg, the Diet met for the first time after a break of 13 years. On November 26, at Count Michael Esterházy's palace in Pressburg, Liszt performed for an audience of aristocrats and members of the society. A group of magnates undertook to pay Liszt an annual sum of 600 Austro-Hungarian Gulden for six years so that he could study abroad.
In Vienna, Liszt received piano lessons from Carl Czerny, who in his own youth had been Beethoven's student. Czerny, according to his "Lebenserinnerungen" ("Memoires"), was struck by the boy's talent but found that the boy had no knowledge of proper fingerings and that his playing style was very chaotic. Since July 1822, Liszt was also studying composition with Antonio Salieri. According to Salieri's letter to Prince Esterházy of August 25, 1822, he had until then introduced his pupil to some elements of music theory. Earnest lessons in composition were to follow later. As the child prodigy's admirers soon began idolizing him as a new Mozart or Beethoven, Salieri had his work cut out for him. Allusions to this problem can be found in Schilling's "Franz Liszt".
Very soon Liszt was heard in private circles. His public debut in Vienna was on December 1, 1822, at a concert at the "Landständischer Saal". Liszt played Hummel's Concerto in A minor as well as an improvisation on an air from Rossini's opera "Zelmira" and the Allegretto of Beethoven's 7th Symphony. On April 13, 1823, he gave a famous concert at the "Kleiner Redoutensaal". This time he played Hummel's Concerto in B minor, variations by Moscheles, and an own improvisation. According to legend, he impressed Beethoven, although deaf, to such an extent that he congratulated Liszt on the stage, kissing him on the forehead and giving him enthusiastic praise. According to Schilling's account, authorized by Liszt, during the concert the boy had had the impression that Beethoven was looking at him from a distance but did not address him, let alone kiss him.
In spring 1823, when the one year's leave of absence came to an end, Adam Liszt asked Prince Esterházy in vain for two more years. Adam Liszt therefore took his leave of the Prince's services. At the end of April 1823, the family for the last time returned to Hungary. At the end of May 1823, the family returned to Vienna.
The child prodigy.
On September 20, 1823, the Liszt family left Vienna for Paris. To support himself and his parents, Liszt gave concerts in Munich, Augsburg, Stuttgart and Strasbourg. In Miesich he was regarded as an equal to the boy Mozart. On December 11, 1823, the family arrived in Paris. The next day, Adam Liszt together with his son went to the Conservatoire, hoping the child prodigy would be accepted as a student. But Cherubini, the director, told them that according to a new rule only the French were allowed to take part in piano class. Consequentially, Adam Liszt, who had very despotic manners, now became his son's only piano teacher. He had his son practise scales and études with a metronome and also play a number of fugues by J. S. Bach every day, transposing them into different keys.
Liszt learned French quickly and it became his main language. He made the acquaintance of the piano manufacturer Sébastien Érard, pioneer of the "double-escapement" system of piano mechanics. Liszt played in private circles and gave concerts on March 7 and April 12, 1824, at the "Theâtre Italiènne", quickly augmenting his popularity. He was well known in Paris as "petit Liszt" ("little Liszt"). In 1824, 1825 and 1827, together with his father, he visited England, where he was known as "Master Liszt". His share of the admissions was large enough for his father to invest a sum of 60,000 Francs in bonds of his former employer Prince Esterházy. The principal was repaid in 1866 when Liszt's mother died. She had until then received the interest payments.
Since 1824, Liszt studied composition with Anton Reicha and Ferdinando Paer. From Adam Liszt's letters it is known that his son had composed several concertos, sonatas, works of chamber music, and much more. While nearly all of those works are lost, some piano works of 1824 were published. These pieces were written in the common style of the contemporary brilliant Viennese school. He had taken works of his former master Czerny as a model, which Liszt's later virtuoso rivals Sigismond Thalberg and Theodor Döhler would also emulate. The response to these early works was disheartening. In spring 1824, with Paer's help, Liszt started composing an opera Don Sanche, ou Le château de l'amour ("Don Sanche, or The Castle of Love"). Conducted by Rodolphe Kreutzer, with Adolphe Nourrit as Don Sanche, the opera premiered on October 17, 1825 at the Académie royale de Musique, but without success. Liszt afterwards felt drawn in a different direction. He started disliking music and spent much time with religious ideas. However, he was forced by his father to continue giving concerts. In 1826 in Marseille he started composing original etudes. They were projected as 48 pieces, but only 12 pieces were realized and published as his Opus 6.
In summer 1827, Liszt fell ill. Adam Liszt went with his son to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a spa town on the English Channel. While Liszt himself was recovering, his father fell ill with typhus. On August 28, 1827, Adam Liszt died. Liszt composed a short funeral march which might have carried a double meaning. Together with his father, the concertizing child prodigy had died. Adam Liszt was buried in Boulogne. Liszt never visited his father's grave.
In later years, Liszt himself always took a skeptical point of view regarding his career as child prodigy. While he had earned much money and gained a prominent name, his general education had had no chance of development. He made up for this lack by intense reading. Starting in the early 1830s, he read voraciously, and by the time of his death in 1886 he had acquired many thousands of books. Regarding his compositional oeuvre as child prodigy, he wrote to Lina Ramann in March 1880 that nothing had come of it because there was nothing to it. For young as well as for old composers it was always the best when the manuscripts were lost, he felt.
Adolescence in Paris.
Artistic development.
After his father's death Liszt returned to Paris. For the next five years he was to live with his mother in a small apartment at 7 Rue Montholon. In 1831 they moved to 61 Rue de Provence. At the end of 1833 Liszt rented his own apartment which he called "Ratzenloch". To earn money, Liszt gave lessons in piano playing and composition, privately as well as at a private school for young ladies at 43 Rue de Clichy, run by one Madame Alix. On October 23, 1828, the "Corsair" erroneously reported that Liszt had died. But a correction appeared in the same paper three days later: a note from Madame Alix said that he had not ceased teaching at her school and was in good health.
On occasion Liszt performed at private soirées typically organized by Rossini, who would invite other artists as well. At the designated time, they all entered their host's mansion via the back door. In the salon, they silently assembled around the piano. They would perform their pieces in turn. After the host had politely thanked them, they would leave. Rossini would receive the money the next day to distribute among the artists. Liszt also took part in concerts by other artists. At the end of December 1830 or at the beginning of January 1831, Liszt left Paris, travelling to Geneva. The voyage led to severe problems in his private life. For those reasons there was a gap of nearly two years in Liszt's concert activities. It was not until January 28, 1832, that he accepted an invitation to a charity concert in Rouen. On April 2, 1832, he performed at a concert in Paris again.
During winter 1831–32, Liszt made the acquaintance of Felix Mendelssohn and Frédéric Chopin. Both of them arrived in Paris with a suitcase full of masterworks. In comparison with this, Liszt —neglecting his works as child prodigy— had not much more to offer than an oeuvre of a single piece, his "Bride-fantasy". Their impression of Liszt is known from their letters. Chopin, in a letter to Titus Woyciechowski of December 12, 1831, wrote that "all Parisian pianists, including Liszt, were zeros in comparison with Kalkbrenner". Mendelssohn, in a letter to his sister Fanny of December 28, 1831, wrote that Liszt was the most dilettantic of all dilettantes. He played everything from memory, but with wrong basses, i.e. with wrong harmonies.
Important influences on Liszt also came from the sect of the religiously-oriented Père Enfantin faction of the Saint-Simonists. As part of their ideology, contemporary forms of marriage were regarded as prison for women and in this sense as a kind of crime. In the beginning of January 1832 they distributed a flyer according to which all artists should take part in the new religion. They were to create better music than Beethoven and Rossini. On January 11, 1832, Liszt —himself a follower of the Père Enfantin— told his student Valerie Boissier and her mother Auguste that he would cease giving lessons to concentrate all of his forces on his development as artist.
In spite of his announcement, Liszt continued giving lessons. Then, after attending an April 20, 1832 charity concert, for the victims of a Parisian cholera epidemic, by Niccolò Paganini Liszt became determined to become as great a virtuoso on the piano as Paganini was on the violin. According to a letter to Pierre Wolff of May 2, 1832, he had for a whole fortnight practised, four to five hours a day, thirds, sixths, octaves, tremolos, repetitions of notes, cadenzas, etc. However, by the time the letter was delivered, Liszt was no longer practising that much. According to a second part, written on May 8, he had left Paris, following an invitation by one family Reiset for a vacation in Ecoutebœuf, a small place near Rouen.
In Ecoutebœuf, Liszt started composing his "Grande Fantaisie de Bravoure sur La Clochette de Paganini" ("Grand Bravura Fantasy on Paganini's "La Campanella"") on a melody from the rondo finale of Paganini's second violin concerto. The early version of the "Clochette-fantasy" was not yet completed because Liszt fell ill in Ecoutebœuf. When on November 5, 1834, at a concert of Berlioz, he for the first time played the fantasy, it was a complete fiasco and taken as new proof that Liszt had no talent for composition at all. A shorter piece using the same melody as well as a melody from the finale of Paganini's first concerto was included in the 1838–39 "Etudes d'exécution transcendante d'après Paganini" ("Studies of Transcendental Execution after Paganini").
In 1833, Liszt began seeing Marie d'Agoult. In addition to this, at the end of April 1834 he made the acquaintance of Felicité de Lamennais. Under the influence of both, Liszt's creative output exploded. Until May 1835 he composed at least half a dozen works for piano and orchestra, a duo-sonata for piano and violin on a Mazurka by Chopin, a duo for two pianos on two of Mendelssohn's "Lieder ohne Worte", and much more. All this found a very abrupt end, after Liszt on June 1, 1835, left Paris, travelling to Basel. Most of the works he had composed from summer 1832 to May 1835 were neither published nor performed. In a "Baccalaureus-letter" to George Sand, published in the "Revue et Gazette musicale" of February 12, 1837, Liszt vowed to consign them to the fire.
Private life.
Caroline de Saint-Cricq.
As an integral part of the usual Liszt biography, a love affair with his pupil Caroline de Saint-Cricq must be mentioned, although documented evidence for this is less than meager. Traditionally Caroline has been described as nothing short of an angel come down to earth, without worldly desires of whatsoever kind. Besides, she was very beautiful and very rich. Liszt, who had not the least interest in those qualities, became her piano teacher in spring 1828 when he was 16 and she was 17. While talking exclusively of holy things, they quickly fell in love. Supported by Caroline's mother, they wanted to marry. Shortly afterwards, on June 30 or July 1, 1828, the mother died. Caroline's father, French Minister of Commerce in the government of Charles X, then acted as antagonist, showing Liszt the door. Caroline fell ill, and Liszt suffered a nervous breakdown. At age 19, i.e., in 1830, Caroline married one Bertrand d'Artigaux. Together with her husband, she moved to Pau in southern France. Unfortunately, no matter how touching the story is, until this day not a single author has given contemporary sources supporting it.
Adèle de Laprunarède.
A further love affair, as reported by Liszt's biographers, sounds even more adventurous. Per Alan Walker, after the revolution of 1830 a total change of Liszt's personality must have occurred. His nervous breakdown was forgotten, his holy ideas were discarded, and he was now hungry for whatever experiences life had to offer. With Adèle de Laprunarède, very beautiful and very rich, although married, he enjoyed his first long love affair. Surrounded by snow and ice, with mountain roads impassable, they were marooned on Marlioz Castle in the Savoy for the whole winter of 1832/33. However, the impression created by Liszt's own comment in one of his early letters to Marie d'Agoult is again different: "I've been nothing but a cowardly and miserable poltroon for Adèle." In addition, there was still another lady, also very beautiful, with whom Liszt traveled to the Savoyen Alps. Her name was "Mlle. de Barré". Besides, Walker mentions ladies "Madame D..." and "Charlotte Laborie", who both wanted to get Liszt married. More reliable sources indicate that "Madame D..." was Madame Didier, a very close friend of Liszt's mother. She also lived at 7 Rue Montholon and wanted to marry her daughter Euphémie to Liszt.
Marie d'Agoult.
In summer 1832, while Liszt was composing his "Clochette-fantasy", he was also making plans for other works. But he found no time to carry them out. At the end of August 1832 he went to Bourges where his former student Rose Petit was getting married. On October 6 he returned to Paris. During the whole winter of 1832–33, i.e., until the end of April 1833, he was involved in many social events, often returning home in the early morning. For this reason only a single new work, a free transcription of Schubert's song "Die Rose", was published. On December 9, 1832, Liszt attended a concert at which Berlioz' "Symphonie fantastique" and —with brilliant success— for the first time the sequel "Lélio ou le Retour à la Vie" ("Lélio or the Return to Life") were performed. The concert was also attended by Marie d'Agoult.
Liszt was feeling more and more averse to the social life; Marie d'Agoult's situation was similar. In the winter of 1831/32, with her husband Charles and their daughters Claire and Louise, she travelled to Geneva where the married couple experienced a crisis. In addition in January 1832, one of Marie d'Agoult's cousins committed suicide. Marie d'Agoult herself had ideas of suicide and was attended to at the sanatorium of one Dr. Coindet in Geneva; her husband took their daughters back with him to Paris. In April 1832, Marie d'Agoult's half-sister Auguste Ehrmann committed suicide. After Marie d'Agoult's own return to Paris, she started in December 1832 to rejoin the social life but found the usual customs stupid and annoying. She then decided to buy an estate with a castle at Croissy, a small village near Paris. The contract of sale was concluded on April 18, 1833, for a sum of more than 300,000 Francs.
According to Marie d'Agoult's "Memoirs", written from a distance of more than 30 years, she had made Liszt's acquaintance at end the of 1833 at a soiree given by a Marquise le Vayer. But the Marquise had already died on February 1, 1833, and Marie d'Agoult's correspondence with Liszt includes letters from spring 1833. The question of the precise beginning of their acquaintance is therefore open. Liszt performed at soirees of the same social circles which were frequented by Marie d'Agoult. An example is Count Rudolph Apponyi, Austrian ambassador in Paris, who arranged private concerts at his home on every Sunday. His wife was a close friend of Marie d'Agoult, who on December 23, 1832, visited the Apponyis. One week later, on December 30, Liszt performed at the same place. Liszt and Marie d'Agoult therefore might have met already at earlier occasions. However, Liszt himself, in a letter of July 17, 1834, gave a hint pointing back to a date 18 months prior. Hence January 1833 might be regarded as their starting point.
In winter 1833–34 Liszt rented the "Ratzenloch". Several times Marie d'Agoult visited him disguised as "Comte de la B...". Also, Liszt visited her at Croissy. He made friends with her daughters who gave him the nickname "Bon Vieux" ("Good Old One"). Since April 28, 1834, Liszt was in Paris alone again, while Marie d'Agoult had retired to Croissy. In May 1834, he had a dispute with Madame Laborie. She presumed that he was still in love with Adèle de Laprunarède and tried to force him to give her Adèles letters. On May 16 Liszt left Paris, following an invitation by one Madame Haineville to Castle Carentonne near Bernay in Normandy. While he was in Carentonne Marie d'Agoult found some of his old letters to Euphémie Didier, suspecting they were written to Adèle and Liszt had become engaged with her.
Returning from Carentonne, Liszt arrived in Paris on June 22, 1834. A couple of days later Marie d'Agoult left, travelling to Mortier, an estate of her mother where she stayed for two months. As of summer 1834 it was clear that Liszt and Marie d'Agoult were a couple. But their affaire had a colour of a very particular kind. Liszt's letters of spring and summer 1834 are full of complaints about his illness and depression. Yet even in letters of July 1834 he described Marie d'Agoult as a woman whom he desired, after whom he always had to run but without ever reaching her.
George Sand.
In autumn and winter 1834–35, Liszt made the acquaintance of George Sand. He had in the "Revue des Deux Mondes" of May 15, 1834, read her first "Lettre d'un voyageur" on her impressions of Italy, which he found magnificent. In a letter to Marie d'Agoult of August 25, 1834, he wrote, he had two days earlier met Alfred de Musset. Musset had told him much about George Sand. Liszt had asked Musset to gain him an introduction when Musset would next meet George Sand.
At the time – January 1835 – George Sand and Musset were getting along. However, new problems arose after she had met Liszt: rumours of Liszt and George Sand having an intimate affair with each other. Later that same month, in order to defend herself George Sand tried to get Liszt to vouch for her innocence, but he had disappeared and two letters to him were not answered. In letters to the Abbé de Lamennais and to Marie d'Agoult of January 14, Liszt had announced that he would leave Paris for a voyage the following day. Afterwards, for the whole period of January 15 until the end of February 1835, he seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth.
Liszt in Geneva.
From July 28, 1835, Liszt and Marie d'Agoult lived in an apartment of the building on the corner of Rue Tabazan and Rue des Belles-Filles, now 22 Rue Etienne Dumont, where Liszt's first child, Blandine, was born. He also taught at the Conservatoire de musique de Genève.
Concert tours.
Problematic beginning.
In autumn 1837 Liszt's situation was precarious. He had on September 6, together with Marie d'Agoult, arrived in Bellagio and had there started composing. By October 22, 1837, his "12 Grandes Etudes" were complete. Liszt had also commenced his "Impressions et poésies" which were destined to be published one year later as part of the "Album d'un voyageur". Unfortunately his reputation as a composer languished at a low level. It was difficult for Liszt to find a publisher willing to take his works. Liszt contacted the publishers Mori in London and Haslinger in Vienna. The answers which he received from both were nearly identical. They requested that Liszt first travel to London and Vienna and play his works in concerts there. In addition, Liszt received a letter from his former teacher Czerny who also suggested a voyage for concerts to Vienna. Until the end of 1837 Liszt's arrival in Vienna was daily expected, but he was tied down in Italy, standing by the very pregnant Marie d'Agoult. On December 24 their second daughter Cosima was born.
In the beginning of April 1838, Liszt and Marie d'Agoult were now living in Venice, and he travelled for concerts to Vienna, taking a flood in Hungary as his chance. When Liszt left Vienna at the end of May 1838, he had to promise that he would return in September for concerts in Vienna and also in Hungary. In order to make it possible, he agreed with Marie d'Agoult that they would together travel along the Danube to Constantinople. In spite of preparations, Liszt's plan did not work. On May 9, 1839, Liszt's son Daniel was born in Rome, and he started his virtuoso career as the father of three children.
One and a half years.
Trieste, Vienna, Leipzig.
On October 18, 1839, Liszt accompanied Marie d'Agoult to Livorno, from where she and her daughters Blandine and Cosima traveled via Genoa, Marseille and Lyon to Paris, arriving on November 3. Daniel had been left behind in Italy where the painter Henri Lehmann took care of him. Liszt first travelled to Venice, then to Trieste where he gave concerts on November 5 and 11. On November 19, 1839, Liszt gave a first concert in Vienna. He was afterwards ill for about a week. From November 27, Liszt gave additional concerts in Vienna. They were huge successes. On December 5, 1839, Liszt headlined the bill, playing for the first time his "Sonnambula-fantasy", and at a "Concert Spirituel" at which he played Beethoven's Concerto in C Minor. He had learnt both works during the previous night. Liszt also took part in concerts of other artists, among them Madame Camilla Pleyel with whom he had had a love affair several years before. They played a brilliant fantasy for four hands on Rossini's "Wilhelm Tell" by Herz.
On February 1, 1840, Liszt returned to Vienna where he gave further concerts. During the first half of March 1840, he played in Prague. Although until now the success of Liszt's concerts had been sensational, his successes decreased after he left the city, travelling to Dresden and Leipzig. Especially in Leipzig, Liszt encountered strong hostility. Schumann, who had met Liszt in Dresden, wrote reviews praising Liszt's concerts. Mendelssohn also tried to save the situation. To help Liszt, he organized a concert on March 30 in the Gewandhaus. Together with Liszt and Ferdinand Hiller, he played a concerto for three pianos by J. S. Bach. But when Liszt left Leipzig, he still had many enemies there.
Paris, London, first British tour.
In the beginning of April 1840, Liszt travelled via Metz to Paris. In letters to Marie d'Agoult he had imagined his return as the triumphant beginning of a new period of his life. As a point of honour, he would give a series of concerts in Paris, earning at least 20,000 Francs from them. But after his arrival Liszt learnt that his successes in Vienna, Pest and Prague counted as nearly nothing in Paris. The "sabre of honour" brought less pleasure than pain to him. It evoked a flood of caricatures, sarcastic comments and polemical attacks in the press. Berlioz wrote in an article in the "Journal des Debates", "We let Mozart and Beethoven starve to death, while giving a sabre of honour to Mr. Liszt."
Instead of a series of concerts, Liszt gave only a single matinee on April 20 at the Salons Erard. Besides he took part in a concert of ecclesiastical music, given by the Princess Belgiojoso. The matinee had had the character of a private concert, since Liszt himself had invited his audience. This brought his total earnings in Paris to zero. Even worse, reviewers compared Liszt to his rival Thalberg, who had arrived in Paris a couple of weeks before Liszt. Although Thalberg gave no concert he was nevertheless regarded as the leading piano virtuoso of the time. In contrast to Liszt, Thalberg was also praised as composer of genius.
In the beginning of May 1840 Liszt went to London. He had hoped that he could in London gain a victory over Thalberg by earning more money than his rival, but the financial result of his concerts was disappointing. On June 7, 1840, Marie d'Agoult joined Liszt in England. She stayed in Richmond while Liszt was occupied with concerts in London. On June 20, an éclat occurred.
On August 15, 1840, in Rotterdam, Liszt and Marie d'Agoult had to separate. While Marie d'Agoult returned to Paris, Liszt travelled to England. As a member of the troupe of Lewis Henry Lavenu he made a tour of England consisting of about 50 concerts covering the length and breadth of the country. Lavenu was the stepson of publisher and violinist Nicolas Mori. Accompanying them on the tour were Lavenu's half-brother Frank Mori, a pupil of Sigismond Thalberg, two singers, Louisa Bassano and Mlle. de Varny, and John Orlando Parry, a musician, singer and entertainer (who vividly recorded the tour in his diary). They started on August 17, giving concerts in Chichester and Portsmouth. Six weeks later, the tour ended with concerts on September 25 and 26 in Brighton. The success was only moderate. Lavenu came out with a net loss of 5,000–6,000 Francs, but he negotiated a second tour with Liszt for winter 1840/41.
Fontainebleau, Hamburg, second British tour.
Following Liszt's first tour in England he returned to Paris to meet Marie d'Agoult. They traveled to Fontainebleau for a fortnight's holiday, enjoying a happy respite from their cares. Later they would both claim not to have considered marriage. But it is known from their letters that during their stay in Fontainebleau they became engaged. Marie d'Agoult, still wedded to her husband Charles, hoped she could follow the recent example of Princess Belgiojoso. The Princess, after several years of being separated from her husband, had just been divorced. Liszt might have thought of still another example. He admired Schumann, who had on September 12, 1840, married Clara Wieck.
Liszt planned to give concerts from Fontainebleau to Hamburg. After, he would go to Berlin. During the winter he would play in Great Britain, travelling once again with Lavenu's troupe. In January 1841 he would return via Brussels to Paris. Together with Robert and Clara Schumann, he would then play in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, concluding in May and June 1841 with concerts in London. After this last stay, his touring days would be over. Together with Marie d'Agoult he would travel via Geneva to Italy, where a stay with a long rest would follow. In order to avoid further strife, Liszt had promised to take Marie d'Agoult's counsel in all important matters.
Liszt left on October 19. He first returned to Paris, visiting the music publishers Bernard Latte and Maurice Schlesinger. At Schlesinger's office he met by chance his later son-in-law Richard Wagner. It was a fleeting first encounter that left no traces. From Paris, Liszt travelled to Hamburg, arriving on October 26. His first concert was on October 28. The program included some pieces of vocal music, but it turned out that the singers were not allowed to take part in the concert. In a short speech Liszt announced that he would play more solo pieces instead. His second concert, on October 31, was a greater success. On November 2 he took part in a concert of his pupil Hermann Cohen. While Liszt had planned to leave on November 4 for Berlin, he took his chance in Hamburg, giving an additional "last concert" on November 6. On that day he received a letter by Lavenu according to which he was expected in London on November 22. Since this did not leave enough time for traveling to Berlin and performing at concerts there, he gave another "farewell concert" in Hamburg on November 10.
A becalmed Channel slowed him down, and it was not until November 23 that Liszt arrived in Dover. Yet another delay occurred when Liszt missed his train to London. Lavenu's troupe had on November 23 already given a first concert in Reading. Since Liszt, announced as a superstar, was absent, most of the 140 people in the audience had left in anger. A concert in Newbury, also announced for November 23, was therefore cancelled. Lavenu travelled to London where he met Liszt on November 24. That evening, Liszt arrived in Oxford and took part in his first concert of the tour. During the following months the troupe traveled by coach come rain or come shine, usually giving two concerts at different places every day, with Sundays being their day off. In large cities such as Dublin they had an easier time of it. They performed at several concerts and could stay for some days. But this was an exception. After a last concert on January 29, 1841, in Halifax, it turned out that the financial result was catastrophic. Liszt himself had lost a sum of more than 15,000 Gulden, i.e. more than 43,000 Francs. The troupe returned to London where Liszt was lent money by Ignaz Moscheles and the publisher Beale of Cramer & Co.
Belgium, Paris, London.
On February 3, 1841, Liszt took part in a concert in London given by Jules Benedict. The next day he left for Brussels. Liszt had to cross the Channel again and was again late. Much ice was on the sea, and the captain of Liszt's ship had to wait until he could dare to enter the harbour of Ostend. When Liszt arrived in Brussels late in the evening on February 9, the concert had already ended five hours before. Fétis, director of the Conservatoire in Brussels, organized a private concert on February 11 at which Liszt performed to an audience of 150. Liszt afterwards gave concerts on February 13 in Liège, February 16 in Brussels, February 19 in Liège, February 20 in Ghent, February 24 in Liège and February 26 in Brussels. On March 2 and 4 he gave concerts in Antwerp. After a last concert on March 13 in Brussels, Liszt returned to Paris. By comparison with his former plans, he was two months late in arriving. His plan for a voyage to St. Petersburg and Moscow was therefore cancelled.
Liszt's stay in Paris turned out to be his most successful season since his time as child prodigy. His rival Thalberg, who had announced his own concerts in Paris, changed his plans, performing in Frankfurt am Main, Leipzig and Warsaw instead. In Paris, Liszt gave concerts on March 27 and on April 13 and 25. On March 27 he played his fantasy on "Robert le Diable" which was a huge success. More important, from Liszt's own perspective, was the concert on April 25. It was a charity concert in favour of the Beethoven memorial in Bonn. On April 3 Liszt gave an additional concert in Rouen and on April 28 a concert in Tours. On May 5 he left Paris, travelling via Boulogne to London. At that moment he was convinced that he had at last gained the position in Paris he always coveted.
In London, Liszt performed at several private soirées and at concerts of other artists. However, while Liszt's reputation as virtuoso was steadily increasing, his earnings in London were dismal. In order to solve his financial problems, Liszt was reflecting on an offer he had received from Hamburg. According to this, he should on July 7 take part in a concert at a North German music festival. Around July 10 he should give an own concert in Hamburg besides. Regarding this, he wrote in a letter to Marie d'Agoult of June 16,
On one of the following days, Liszt's financial situation got even worse. In his letter to Marie d'Agoult of June 19 Liszt wrote about an ugly scene that had taken place with Moscheles. Liszt had entirely repaid the money he had lent from Moscheles as well as from Beale. Until the end of his stay in London, Liszt received several letters from Marie d'Agoult with objections against his new ideas. But his decision had already been made. On July 1, after he had performed at a soirée of Lady Ashbourne, Liszt left London for Hamburg. He performed at the concert on July 7 and gave on July 9 an own concert.
Nonnenwerth.
After his concert in Hamburg Liszt received an invitation to Copenhagen. He played on July 15 at the Danish court and afterwards gave several concerts. During Liszt's stay in Copenhagen he and Marie d'Agoult agreed to meet around August 4 at Nonnenwerth, a small island in the Rhine near Bonn. At Nonnenwerth they stayed at a hotel that used to be a monastery.
In contrast to his letters to Marie d'Agoult, Liszt had in a letter to Simon Löwy of May 20, 1841, already announced that he would in November 1841 set out for Berlin and pass the whole next winter in Russia. On August 4, shortly before arriving at Nonnenwerth, Liszt wrote in a letter to Count Alberti that he was planning to keep shelling the both banks and of the Rhine with concerts. As a consequence, Liszt's solitude and happiness together with Marie d'Agoult were short-lived.
Liszt in Weimar.
In 1847, Liszt gave up public performances on the piano and in the following year finally took up the invitation of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia to settle at Weimar, where he had been appointed "Kapellmeister Extraordinaire" in 1842, remaining there until 1861. During this period he acted as conductor at court concerts and on special occasions at the theatre, gave lessons to a number of pianists, including Hans von Bülow, who married Liszt's daughter Cosima in 1857 (before her marriage to Richard Wagner). He also wrote articles championing Berlioz and Wagner, and produced those orchestral and choral pieces upon which his reputation as a composer mainly rests. His efforts on behalf of Wagner, who was then an exile in Switzerland, culminated in the first performance of "Lohengrin" in 1850.
Among his compositions written during his time at Weimar are the first and second piano concertos, the "Totentanz", the "Concerto pathétique" for two pianos, the Piano Sonata in B minor, a number of Etudes, fifteen Hungarian Rhapsodies, twelve orchestral symphonic poems, the Faust Symphony and Dante Symphony, the 13th Psalm for tenor solo, chorus and orchestra, the choruses to Herder's dramatic scenes "Prometheus", and the "Graner Fest Messe". Much of Liszt's organ music also comes from this period, including the well-known Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale Ad nos, ad salutarem undam and Fantasy and Fugue on the Theme B-A-C-H (the latter also arranged for solo piano).
In 1851 he published a revised version of his 1837 "Douze grandes études", now titled "Études d'execution transcendante", and the following year the "Grandes études de Paganini" (Grand etudes after Paganini), the most famous of which is "La campanella" (The Little Bell), a study in octaves, trills and leaps.
Meets Princess von Sayn-Wittgenstein.
Also in 1847, while touring in the Polish Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire), Liszt met Princess Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein. The Princess was an author, whose major work was published in 16 volumes, each containing over 1,600 pages. Her long-winded writing style had some effect on Liszt himself. His biography of Chopin ("Life of Chopin") and his chronology and analysis of Gypsy music were both written in the Princess's loquacious style (Grove's Dictionary says that she undoubtedly collaborated with him on this and other works). Princess Carolyne lived with Liszt during his years in Weimar.
Failed marriage attempt.
The Princess eventually wished to marry Liszt, but since she had been previously married and her husband, Russian military officer Prince Nikolaus von Sayn-Wittgenstein-Ludwigsburg (1812–1864), was still alive, she had to convince the Roman Catholic authorities that her marriage to him had been invalid. After huge efforts and a monstrously intricate process, she was temporarily successful (September 1860). It was planned that the couple would marry in Rome, on Liszt's 50th birthday, October 22, 1861. Liszt arrived in Rome the previous day, but by the late evening the Princess declined to marry him. It appears that both her husband and the Tsar of Russia had managed to have the Vatican's agreement revoked. The Russian government also impounded her several estates in the Polish Ukraine, which made her later marriage to anybody unfeasible.
Later relations with the Princess.
Much later, in a letter of May 30, 1875, she wrote to Eduard Liszt that she had found Liszt to have been ungrateful. While she had spent her money and had lost nearly all of her former fortune, it had been several millions, he had had during all the time of the Weimar years love affairs with other women. Especially in September 1860 there had been an affaire with the singer Emilie Genast. For this reason she had decided that the planned wedding should be cancelled.
The question whether the Princess was correct in her accusations against Liszt, remains open. Regarding Emilie Genast, in the second half of September 1860 she had for a time of about two weeks visited Liszt in Weimar, on his invitation. In the beginning of October she left, travelling to the Rhineland. Liszt composed for her the love song "Wieder möcht' ich Dir begegnen" ("I'm wishing to meet you again"). Besides, he made a new version of his song "Nonnenwerth" as well as orchestrations of the songs "Die junge Nonne", "Gretchen am Spinnrade" and "Song of Mignon" by Schubert. While they were now all dedicated to Emilie Genast, they had in Liszt's youth been strongly correlated with his affair with Marie d'Agoult. "Mignon" has words "Dahin!, dahin möcht' ich mit dir, o mein Geliebter, ziehn!" (She wants to go together with her darling to Italy.) Reflecting this, Liszt also made a new version of his song "Es rauschen die Winde" with words "Dahin, dahin, sind die Tage der Liebe dahin!" ("the days of love are gone"). From those hints no certain conclusion can be drawn, but Liszt seems to have detected a kind of resemblance between Emilie Genast and the young Marie d'Agoult. However, nearly all of Liszt's letters to Emilie Genast, at least 98, have survived, but are still unpublished; so nothing more can be said.
Might the suspicion of the Princess regarding Emilie Genast insofar have been true or false, it is sure that she was not altogether wrong. It is known from Liszt's correspondence with his mother that in the beginning of 1848 he was in Weimar living together with a Madame F... from Frankfurt-am-Main, a former mistress of Prince Wittgenstein. In March 1848, after Liszt had received a letter of the Princess in which she announced her arrival, Madame F... was very hastily transported to Paris. She visited Liszt’s mother as well as his former secretary Belloni and received an amount of money, telling them that she was pregnant by Liszt. In November 1848 she claimed, she had had an abortion, and disappeared. In 1853 or 1854, Liszt's main mistress was in secret Agnes Street-Klindworth. Liszt visited her for a last time in autumn 1861 in Brussels. It is suspected that the father of some of her children was Liszt.
Liszt in Rome.
The 1860s were a period of severe catastrophes of Liszt's private life. After he had on December 13, 1859, already lost his son Daniel, on September 11, 1862, also his daughter Blandine died. In letters to friends Liszt afterwards announced, he would retreat to a solitary living. A more precise impression of his ideas can be gained by looking at his works. On October 22, 1862, his 51st birthday, Liszt took his arrangement of the overture to Wagner's opera "Tannhäuser" and cut the music illustrating Tannhäuser's living with "Frau Venus" and her ladies away. He had good reasons for identifying him himself with Tannhäuser. One year earlier he had like Tannhäuser travelled from Thuringia to Rome. Like Tannhäuser, also his sins had not been forgiven, as can be seen from his failed marriage. It was Liszt's conclusion that his sexual life had been the cause of his bad luck. He considered a living of continence and resignation as the only appropriate choice for him. There is little doubt that he was insofar following Princess Wittgenstein's advice. It was her opinion that sexuality was the worst of all evils in the world.
Liszt also searched for an adequate environment. He found it at the monastery "Madonna del Rosario", just outside Rome, where on June 20, 1863, he took up quarters in a small, Spartan apartment. He had on June 23, 1857, already joined a Franciscan order. On April 25, 1865, he received from Gustav Hohenlohe the tonsure and a first one of the minor orders of the Catholic Church. Three further minor orders followed on July 30, 1865. Until then, Liszt was Porter, Lector, Exorcist, and Acolyte. While Princess Wittgenstein tried to persuade him to proceed in order to become priest, he did not follow her. In his later years he explained, he had wanted to preserve a rest of his freedom. By chance, there was a worldly counterpoint to Liszt's becoming ecclesiastic. In the second half of 1865 his two "Episoden aus Lenaus Faust" appeared. The first piece, the "1st Mephisto-Waltz", musically paints a vulgar scene in a village inn. Was this coincidence merely an accident, the transcriptions of the pieces "Confutatis maledictis" and "Lacrymosa" of Mozart's Requiem, which Liszt made on January 21, 1865, were in a better sense characteristic for him. As child prodigy he had been compared and equalled with the child Mozart. While this aspect of his personality had died, he had in 1865 a rebirth as "Abbé Liszt".
During the 1860s in Rome, Liszt's main works were sacral works such as the oratorios "Die Legende von der heiligen Elisabeth" and "Christus" as well as masses such as the "Missa choralis" and the "Ungarische Krönungsmesse". For many of his piano works Liszt also took sacral subjects. Examples are the piece "À la Chapelle Sixtine" on melodies by Mozart and Allegri, the two pieces "Alleluja" and "Ave Maria d'Arcadelt", and the two Legends "St. François d'Assise" and "St. François de Paule, marchant sur les flots". The two pieces "Illustrations de l'Africaine" on melodies by Meyerbeer are at least in parts of a sacral style. The same goes for the transcription of a scene of Verdi's opera "Don Carlos". But, besides, Liszt still composed works on worldly subjects. Examples of this kind are the concert etudes "Waldesrauschen" and "Gnomenreigen" as well as the fantasy on Mosonyi's opera "Szep Ilonka" and the transcription of the final scene "Liebestod" of Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde". Further examples are the pieces "Rêverie sur un motif de l'opéra Roméo et Juliette" and "Les sabéennes, Berceuse de l'opéra La Reine de Saba" after Gounod.
At some occasions, Liszt took part in Rome's musical life. On March 26, 1863, at a concert at the "Palazzo Altieri", he directed a program of sacral music. The "Seligkeiten" of his "Christus-Oratorio" and his "Cantico del Sol di Francesco d'Assisi", as well as Haydn's "Die Schöpfung" and works by J. S. Bach, Beethoven, Jornelli, Mendelssohn and Palestrina were performed. On January 4, 1866, Liszt directed the "Stabat mater" of his "Christus-Oratorio", and on February 26, 1866, his "Dante-Symphony". There were several further occasions of similar kind, but in comparison with the duration of Liszt's stay in Rome, they were exceptions. Bódog Pichler, who visited Liszt in 1864 and asked him for his future plans, had the impression that Rome's musical life was not satisfying for Liszt.
Threefold life.
Liszt returned to Weimar in 1869. He began a series of piano master classes there, which he would teach a few months every year. From 1876 he also taught for several months every year at the Hungarian Music Academy at Budapest. He continued to live part of each year in Rome, as well. Liszt continued this threefold existence, as he is said to have called it, for the rest of his life.
Last years.
From 1876 until his death he also taught for several months every year at the Hungarian Conservatoire at Budapest. On July 2, 1881, Liszt fell down the stairs of the Hofgärtnerei in Weimar. Though friends and colleagues had noted swelling in Liszt's feet and legs when he had arrived in Weimar the previous month, Liszt had up to this point been in reasonably good health, his body retained the slimness and suppleness of earlier years. The accident, which immobilized him eight weeks, changed all this. A number of ailments manifested—dropsy, asthma, insomnia, a cataract of the left eye and chronic heart disease. The latter would eventually contribute to Liszt's death. He would become increasingly plagued with feelings of desolation, despair and death—feelings he would continue to express nakedly in his works from this period. As he told Lina Ramann, "I carry a deep sadness of the heart which must now and then break out in sound."
Liszt's last concert was performed at the Casino Bourgeois in Luxembourg on July 19, 1886.
He died in Bayreuth on July 31, 1886, officially as a result of pneumonia which he may have contracted during the Bayreuth Festival hosted by his daughter Cosima. At first, he was surrounded by some of his more adoring pupils, including Arthur Friedheim, Siloti and Bernhard Stavenhagen, but they were denied access to his room by Cosima shortly before his death at 11:30 p.m. He is buried in the Bayreuth cemetery. Questions have been posed as to whether medical malpractice played a direct part in Liszt's demise. At 11:30 Liszt was given two injections in the area of the heart. Some sources have claimed these were injections of morphine. Others have claimed the injections were of camphor, shallow injections of which, followed by massage, would warm the body. An accidental injection of camphor into the heart itself would result in a swift infarction and death. This series of events is exactly what Lina Schmalhausen describes in the eyewitness account in her private diary, the most detailed source regarding Liszt's final illness.

Margaret Street, Brisbane

Margaret Street is a major road in the central business district of Brisbane. The street is one of a number that were named after female members of the royal family shortly after the penal colony was settled.
Alice Street lies to the south, while Mary Street runs parallel to the north. Traffic flow along the street is restricted to one direction, towards the north east. From the south an exit ramp from the Riverside Expressway becomes Margaret Street at the William Street intersection.
Buildings.
The building known as 80 George Street has a multi-storey section built across both sides of Margaret Street. A second approach to the Vision Brisbane residential skyscraper is being built on Margaret Street (now on hold). Another prominent building on the road is the skyscraper called Mineral House containing offices. Other tall buildings on the street are mostly apartment buildings including the Royal on Park and The Grosvenor.
History.
In 1885 the Brisbane Hebrew Congregation built a synagogue on Margaret Street, which still stands today, largely unaltered. In 1889, six attached houses, now known as The Mansions were built on the corner of George Street and Margaret Streets, an area that was once highly sought after because of its prestigious location.

Béla Szabados (composer)

Béla Szabados (3 June 1867 – 5 September 1936) was a Hungarian composer. 
Szabados was born in Pest. He first studied composition and the piano with Gyula Erkel, later with Robert Volkmann, Hans Koessler and Sándor Nikolits. In 1888 he joined the staff of the Academy of Music and Dramatic Art as accompanist and coach, and in 1893 was appointed piano teacher and coach at the reorganized Academy of Music. His first string quartet was awarded the Milleniumi Király-dij (Millennial King’s Prize) in 1896. He was appointed professor of singing at the academy in 1920 and two years later he became head of the newly established department for training professors of singing. In 1927 he was appointed principal of the National Conservatory, in which position he remained until his death in Budapest.
Szabados’s music, at once poetic and restrained, is essentially conservative in character; his language never advanced beyond that of the late Romantics. He was principally known as a composer for the theatre and also as a singing teacher: his pedagogical works were in official use by the academy. He composed two operas, "Maria" (1905), "Fanny" (1927).

Stanley Chi

Stanley Tan Chi (born May 12, 1978) is a Chinese Filipino observational comedian, cartoonist and graphics master. Currently, he is the co-host of TV5's Front Act. Best known for his Manila Bulletin-based comicstrip, "Chopsticks," Chi has gained an underground cult following because of his unique comedic chops. He was a semi-finalist on the radio reality show, LOL (Laugh Out Loud) sponsored by AM station DZMM.
Early years.
A Fine Arts graduate who majored in Advertising, Chi graduated from the University of Santo Tomas and quickly acquired a position as Art Director in some of the country's creative centers. His previous working engagements include: J. Romero Advertising and Competitivedge. Meanwhile, various projects and clients he has handled include: PLDT, Petron, Ayala Cebu, Molecules, Sharp, Nikon, Pillsbury, Dunkin' Donuts, Nestea, Makro, Ace Hardware, & SM Appliance Center.
In the year 2003, however, Chi decided to resign from advertising and engage in his true passion.
Chopsticks - the comic strip.
Following his resignation in 2003, Chi sent a sample of his comic strip, Chopsticks to one of the Philippines' biggest dailies, the Manila Bulletin owned by the Manila Bulletin Publishing company. Immediately, Chopsticks entered daily circulation as part of the comics section of Bulletin. The first appearance of the said comic strip was on August 1, 2003.
The daily circulation of Chi's Chopsticks continued for two years. In 2005, his comic became part of the prestigious Manila Bulletin Sunday Colored Comic Section. Chi's works appeared alongside established artist legends, such as Roni Santiago.
In 2007, PSICOM Publishing, Inc. published Chopsticks book 1.
Observational Comedy.
Besides venturing into comic strips and illustrations to express his Tsinoy point of view humor, Chi has also been involved in Observational Stand Up Comedy, since 2005.
Front Act and Robo Rock.
On July 19, 2009, Stanley Chi and Mike Unson premiered the show, Front Act on TV5. Billed as a comedy talk show, Chi regularly does the segment, "Stanley goes to..." In the said segment, Chi has gone to interview Palawan Mayor Ed Hagedorn, tried out for the UST Growling Tigers and studied magic under JB Dela Cruz.
Other regular segments of the show include: Tambytes, The Lighter Side, Mike and Stanley Presents, Open Mike and Funnymation. In May 2010, the show was later moved to RPN with new co-hosts LC Reklamo and Benedict Bartolome. Currently, The Front Act Show is shown on RPN/Solar TV every Saturday at 4:30 PM.
Aside from TV, Chi is also one of the co-hosts of the Robo Rock Radio Show as "Mazinger Chi" heard on UR 105.9 every Thursday nights.
Suplado Tips.
Suplado Tips is the brainchild of Stanley Chi. It started as a random and impromptu post on Facebook. “That online post turned out to be my very first suplado tip,” Chi said. “I toyed with the idea that being cocky can be a means of getting what you want – or at least a way to delude yourself that you already have everything in the first place.” Soon after he shared several of his suplado tips on Facebook, people started reposting his tips.
“Many people dream of sticking it to their bosses or giving someone they hate a nasty remark or two, but they often resort to doing none of the above. Filipinos tend to be non-confrontational, avoiding conflicts as much as they can. Suplado Tips is the funny respite that people with a grudge have been looking for,” Chi said. “Reading a suplado tip is like acting out a fantasy. The book gives you many scenarios where being standoffish gives you the upper hand, something which otherwise would not happen in real life,” Chi added.
Having been released nationwide in National Bookstore and Fully Booked outlets just last March, stores have reported a shortage of the book. In under three months, there have been about 3000 copies sold nationwide. Suplado Tips is already undergoing its first reprinting. The book has reaped a cult following even before the book’s release, with readers already scouring bookstores months before the book made it to the shelves.
Suplado Tips has spurred on a series of video testimonials, all of which hailed the book in comical embroidery. Ramon Bautista, a TV celebrity and a host of the former radio show, The Brewrats, gave the first testimonial. “Simula nung tinuruan ako ni Stanley Chi na maging suplado, nawala ang ubo ko (Ever since Stanley Chi taught me how to be stuck-up, my cough disappeared),” Bautista said in the video with pokerfaced wit. Obviously meant as a comical testament, Bautista went on to describe how being suplado has gained him more fans and stalkers, and how it eventually cured his skin problems. (Bautista also stepped up later on to write the book’s foreword.) Since then, many other celebrities have given their own hilarious accounts of how Suplado Tips has helped them, some of which were not entirely fictional.
With the book selling well months before the official book launch last May, PSICOM Publishing Inc.’s Tom Aquitania was more than happy that he asked Chi to write the book. After the undeniable popularity of Stanley Chi’s suplado tips on Facebook and on television’s Front Act (of which Chi was a host), Aquitania asked Chi to compile them into a book. “Stanley’s suplado tips on Facebook has even led to the creation of the Suplado Society of the Philippines, complete with its own suplado oath. All of this, despite being clearly just a pseudo-serious joke, is also an unmistakable sign that Stanley Chi’s suplado tips is something the public will want more of,” Aquitania said.
Suplado Tips, Chi’s newest venture into humor, is now available online through Psicom Publishing and may also be purchased from all National Bookstore and Fully Booked outlets nationwide.
Trivia.
Stanley Chi was the editor (2007-2007) of Topak Humor Magazine.
In 2008, Topak Magazine was reformatted and turned into the first Philippine Interactive Humor Magazine, Nosebleed Magazine.

Charlie Nothing

Charles Martin Simon (July 8, 1941 – October 23, 2007), better known as Charlie Nothing, was an American musician, musical instrument maker and writer. He created the dingulator, guitar sculptures made out of American cars, and performed at several music festivals in the United States and Europe. He made two albums and published 12 books.
Biography.
Charles Martin Simon was schooled at the Montclair Academy for Boys (later the Montclair Kimberley Academy) in Montclair, New Jersey. After graduating in 1959, Simon went to Rutgers University in New Jersey where he majored in Agriculture and English Literature. But after two years at university he grew unhappy with the courses and dropped out.
After the death of his artist wife in 1965, Simon was "reduced to nothing" which produced a "psyche fragmentation" he called Charlie Nothing the Artist. As Charlie Nothing, he pursued music and the visual arts. He created guitar sculptures made out of American cars he called dingulators and formed a number of "dingulation" bands in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
In the mid-1960s in New York City Nothing formed his first band which included himself on sopranino saxophone, a classically trained Indian tabla player and a female Japanese vocalist. Then came The First Uniphrenic Church and Bank Band, a group which played at The Village Gate and is said to have included "a young, pre-Blondie Debbie Harry."
Nothing moved to Los Angeles in 1966 where he performed in a show with Frank Zappa and briefly joined the cast of the musical "Hair". He then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he recorded his first album for John Fahey's Takoma Records, "The Psychedelic Saxophone of Charlie Nothing". It featured a sequence of saxophone improvisations by Nothing accompanied by gong, conga and a banjo ukulele. Nothing also did the album cover artwork. The album did not sell well in the United States, but achieved minor cult status in Europe in free improvised music circles.
In 1967 Nothing moved to Santa Cruz, California where he joined an organic farming movement and for the next ten years, worked a farm entirely by hand. He continued his musical performances until 1984, during which time he also recorded several songs, including "Steal-A-Meal", "Fuck You and Your Stupid Wars", "Eatin’ Ain’t Cheatin" and "A Pizza and a Piece of Ass". In the mid-1970s he formed The Superfabulous Dingulators, a band consisting of Charlie Nothing (dingulator), Patrick Bisconti (dingulator), John Kertisz (bamboo flute) and Jesse Ward Jr. (percussion).
Between 1984 and 2005, Nothing stopped performing and focused on his other activities, which included beekeeping and writing. Under the name Charles Martin Simon he set up his own Stinging Insect Removal business, and published over a dozen fiction and non-fiction books, each handmade and self-published. His non-fiction included books on health and nutrition, and his accounts of the psychedelic 1960s.
In 2004 Nothing resumed performing in public again. He started playing at small venues in the Santa Cruz area, but soon began receiving invitations to play at music festivals. He gave a dingulation performance in 2005 at the Two Million Tongues Festival in Chicago, and in 2006 at the Pauze Festival in Ghent, Belgium with Swedish musician Jakob Olausson. In 2007 he released a new CD of dingulator songs entitled "My Cuntree Tits of Me", a play on the phrase "my country, 'tis of thee".
Charlie Nothing died of cancer at the age of 66 on 23 October 2007 at his home in Soquel, California. An anthology album, "40 Years of the Ding : A Charlie Nothing Anthology" comprising all his previously recorded LPs and singles, plus privately released cassette recordings is scheduled to be released by De Stijl Records towards the end of 2008.
Charlie Nothing characterized himself as a "Philosopher/Clown" who, according to his official biography, "Was not born. Did not die. Does not, did not, will not exist."
Dingulator.
Dingulators are guitar sculptures made out of recycled automotive steel. They are a class of musical instrument invented by Charlie Nothing and each construction is unique with its own sound.
Dingulators are steel-string acoustic guitars having typically seven or eight and sometimes up to 21 strings. They have friction pegs and raised frets like those on a sitar. Tuning a dingulator is "variable, organic and evolving." According to Nothing, "the ideal would be to never tune them, to just find where they are going and go with it ... but sometimes I do make adjustments." Nothing, a skilled artisan and welder, used old cars as his material because "cars have the right kind of steel ... [they've] got very soulful steel." Nothing was also making a political statement with his artistic recycling. "It's a sword-to-plowshare kind of thing," he said. "Cars to guitars."
When Nothing began touring, he found taking his big and bulky dingulators aboard aircraft problematic. To overcome these difficulties he developed a smaller portable version with a detachable neck that could be stored in the body, making a compact steel carrying case he could take on airlines.
Folk singer-songwriter Josephine Foster, who featured on the same bill as Nothing at the Two Million Tongues Festival in Chicago in 2005, described dingulators as "folk-art masterpieces". She said they sound like "tuned percussion animate and punctuate [Nothing's spoken-word diatribes." They are also reminiscent of Hans Reichel's pre-daxophone modified-guitar recordings, and of Derek Bailey's improvised music, although Nothing was unfamiliar with both these musicians. Nothing described his musical influences as "everything ... probably as much by the stuff I don't like as the stuff I like."
A photograph of one of Nothing's dingulators appears as the back cover art of "Hearts and Minds, Musical Instrument Makers of America" by editors Nancy Ellis and Robert Bailey, and photographer Jake Jacobson. A dingulator is also the cover art on the "The Western Region" section of the book.

Barwon Heads Airport

Barwon Heads Airport is a small airfield specifically for light aircraft on the Bellarine Peninsula near the township of Barwon Heads, Victoria, Australia.
The airport has remained small and undeveloped until recently, where development is soon to commence. In early 2008, a local council permit was given to construct another five hangars and associated carparking.
The airport has a flight training school with two classrooms, fuel facilities and a seafood outlet. A shower and toilets are located in the terminal building, there is a kitchen, snack and drink machines and a lounge area.
The airport has two runways, the main one is a gravel north/south runway, and there is a smaller east/west grass runway, primarily for ultralight aircraft, and light aircraft in stronger wind conditions.
History.
The owners of Barwon Heads Airport have regularly raised their concerns in relation to skydiving being conducted in the vicinity of the airport. Their concerns are that the airport runway is too close to many proposed drop zones that have been suggested. In 2005, a ban was placed on skydiving in the vicinity of the airport. In 2008, airport owners accused the business Skydive City of using an illegal runway from the airport days after the business was evicted from an airport hangar for failing to pay rent. Airport owners claimed that the illegal runway was compromising the safety of airport users.

Bull Run Lake is a reservoir, an impoundment of the Bull Run River in the U.S. state of Oregon. Providing part of the primary drinking water supply for Portland, Oregon, it rates highly as an oligotrophic lake, a very clean source of water.
The lake basin receives more than of rain annually due to its location in the Cascade Range, about west of Mount Hood. Public access to the area has been controlled since June 17, 1892, with the creation of the Bull Run Reserve by President Benjamin Harrison. Water from the reservoir first flowed into the Portland water system on January 2, 1895. President Theodore Roosevelt restricted entry to all but government agents and water company employees and banned stock grazing on April 28, 1904.
In 1915 a new timber and rock fill dam raised the lake level about . At least two series of efforts were made between 1917 and 1925 to decrease lake seepage. In 1961 additional areas of seepage were sealed with clay, and the outlet dam was remodeled to contain gates at elevations of and .
In 1994, concerns of outflow water temperature and its effect on fish populations led to regular careful measurements of the lake's thermocline characteristics and the inlet water temperature. Concrete pier blocks were installed to minimize the effect of water temperature shock on downstream aquatic life.

Chuck Hansen (May 13, 1947 - March 26, 2003) compiled, over a period of 30 years, the world's largest private collection of unclassified documents on how America developed the atomic bomb.
Research.
Hansen's documents were obtained through the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and since his death have been housed at the National Security Archive at George Washington University.
In 1988, Hansen wrote the book "U.S. Nuclear Weapons: The Secret History", which, along with great detail about the process of developing, testing and administering atomic weapons was critical of the U.S. Defense Department, the Atomic Energy Commission, and some other government agencies. In the book Hansen reported that the early years of nuclear testing were less successful than claimed; bombs failed, or yielded smaller or larger explosions than anticipated or announced, and attempts to develop a radioactivity-free bomb were unsuccessful. "U.S. Nuclear Weapons: The Secret History" is currently out of print, but it is available on compact disk through his publisher.
A second compilation of Hanson's material was published on compact disc as "Swords of Armageddon" in 1995. While Hansen´s "U.S. Nuclear Weapons: The Secret History" was very instructive, "Swords of Armageddon" contains much more information and details about nuclear weapons developed by United States. It is in its second revision.

Sun's curious identity

In combinatorics, Sun's curious identity is the following identity involving binomial coefficients, first established by Zhi-Wei Sun in 2002:
After Sun's publication of this identity, five other proofs were obtained by various mathematicians: they are Panholzer and Prodinger's proof via generating functions, Merlini and Sprugnoli's proof using Riordan arrays, Ekhad and Mohammed's proof by the WZ method, Chu and Claudio's proof with the help of Jensen's formula, and Callan's combinatorial proof involving dominos and colorings.
An application of the identity was given by Sun in a recent paper.

Mary Knep

Mary Knep (died 1681), also Knepp, Nepp, Knip, or Knipp, was an English actress, one of the first generation of female performers to appear on the public stage during the Restoration era.
"Primarily a singer and dancer, Mrs. Knep developed into a first-rate actress." She began her career with the King's Company under the management of Thomas Killigrew. She made her debut in the title role of Jonson's "Epicene" on 1 June 1664. (She was cast as Lucetta in Killigrew's 1664 planned production of his "Thomaso", with an all-female cast, which was cancelled before completion.) Knep played major and minor roles in a range of productions of the 1660s and 1670s, including:
In addition to playing these and other parts, Knep also sang and danced in plays and spoke Prologues and Epilogues. She never achieved the same fame as her younger contemporary Nell Gwyn; Knep had the lead female role in "The Assignation" — but the play was a flop.
"Mrs. Knep was the wife of a Smithfield horsedealer, and the mistress of Pepys" — or at least "she granted him a share of her favours." Scholars disagree on the full extent of the Pepys/Knep relationship; but much of what later generations have known about Knep comes from Samuel Pepys' famous Diary. Pepys first met Knep on 6 December 1665; he described her as "pretty enough, but the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that I ever heard in my life." He called her husband "an ill, melancholy, jealous-looking fellow" and suspected him of abusing his wife. Knep provided Pepys with backstage access, and was a conduit for theatrical and social gossip. When they wrote notes to each other, Pepys signed himself "Dapper Dickey," while Knep was "Barbary Allen" (that popular song was an item in her musical repertory).
Mrs. Knep had at least one child, a son born in June 1666. She may have been a mistress of Sir Charles Sedley. In the late 1670s she became the mistress of actor Joseph Haines; Knep died in childbirth in 1681.

Ranchita Rocks Music Festival

The Ranchita Rocks Music Festival is a three-day annual music festival held at the Golightly Farms Ranch in Ranchita, California. The 2008 event had six stages, featuring classic and contemporary rock performances. as well as comedy acts, camping, crafts vendors, a kids' zone, healing arts, food, beer & wine, drum circles, and a fire breathing fire truck with aerial performers.
History.
The three-day music festival, which debuted in 2007 as a fund-raising concert for community and environmental groups opposed to San Diego Gas & Electric's proposed Sunrise Powerlink electrical transmission line, returned 2008 with several national headlining acts and an emphasis on solar, biodiesel and wind energy to power the event.
In 2008, the music festival was planned to benefit the Protect Our Communities Fund (POC). POC was working together with Ranchita Rocks Festival to host an all green music and camping festival in the San Diego backcountry. The mission is to fight the proposed high power line route scheduled to run from safe, clean, renewable energy projects in Imperial Valley through Anza Borrego State Park, the largest State Park in the Nation. The festival is raising funds to fight this power line as well as highlight and educate on alternative energy choices.
“We strongly believe that energy does not have to be imported over dangerous high voltage transmission lines and that renewable energy should be produced locally, for local consumption,” states Carolyn Morrow who hosts the event on her ranch. 
In 2007 and 2008 fans complained and bands were not paid. No funds were given to the non-profit opposing this renewable energy transmission project. The festival did not achieve its goal, and as of early 2011 the power line was being built between Lake Henshaw & Santa Ysabel.

Johnnie Lewis

Johnnie N. Lewis (born April 16, 1946) is a Liberian lawyer and politician. A native of Sinoe County, Lewis was educated at the University of Liberia in Monrovia and at Yale Law School in the United States. He was the 18th Chief Justice of Liberia, serving from 2006 to 2012. Before his appointment to the Supreme Court, he served as a judge in Liberia’s circuit court system.
Early life.
Johnnie N. Lewis was born to Roderick N. Lewis and Mary Houston-Lewis in Greenville, Sinoe County, Liberia on April 16, 1946. His father was a lawyer while his mother was a school teacher in a family with four boys and two girls. He earned an education at St. Joseph's Catholic Elementary School followed by Sinoe High School.
For college he attended the University of Liberia in Monrovia where he earned a bachelor of arts degree, followed by a bachelor of laws degree from the university’s Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law. Graduating in 1969, he earned cum laude honors from the law school and was editor of the "Liberian Law Journal". Lewis was admitted to the country’s bar association that year before moving to the United States to continue his legal education. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1971 with a masters in law degree.
Legal career.
Lewis returned to Liberia where he was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of Liberia in 1971 and began teaching at his former law school. In 1975, he was appointed to the Third Judicial Circuit Court in his home county by Liberian President William R. Tolbert, Jr., replacing his deceased father. In 1980, the government was overthrown and he left the judiciary. Lewis returned to the Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law in 1984 and served as dean of the school until 1991. That year he also assisted with the transitional government as legal adviser to the president of the interim government.
In private practice in Monrovia, Lewis was once a partner in the Lewis & Lewis Law Offices. While living in that city his home was invaded by gunmen search for him, and though he escaped, a nephew was killed for failing to tell these men his uncle’s whereabouts. Lewis then spent 1993 to 2003 outside of Liberia, working mainly with the United Nations. Employment with that agency led him to Bosnia and Somalia. He has also written two law textbooks, one on criminal law in Liberia and the other on wills and estates.
In 2006, the Liberian Bar Association recommended Lewis be nominated by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to serve as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia. President Johnson-Sirleaf then nominated him in February and he was confirmed by the Liberian Senate on March 2, 2006. Lewis was commissioned as the new Chief Justice on March 3. Upon taking office, he vowed to fight corruption that had plagued the judicial branch in the country.
The Lewis court.
Chief Justice Lewis fired 34 judges in Sinoe County in April 2006 after they failed to report to their assigned courts. In July 2006, the car Lewis was riding in to the funeral of former justice Emmanuel Wureh hit and killed a pedestrian who was jaywalking. The car was driven by a court employee and was speeding at the time of the accident in an attempt to catch up with the funeral procession. An angry mob surrounded the vehicle and Lewis and the other passengers had to be rescued by the Liberian National Police.
In a 3-2 decision with Lewis voting in the majority, the court declared the removal of House Speaker Edwin Snowe by the National Legislature was illegal and ordered his reinstatement. The ruling in January 2007 also invalidated other actions of the legislature including a resolution to allow the Legislature to meet at the Unity Conference Center in Virginia while the Capitol Building in Monrovia was being remodeled. This decision created a rift between some members of the legislature, President Johnson-Sirleaf, and the Supreme Court. In August 2007, the court allowed a criminal prosecution for corruption against former leader Gyude Bryant to proceed in the lower courts.
In October 2007, the Chief Justice accused newspapers in the country of deliberately misspelling his name and using pictures of him inappropriately. He threatened to jail the editors and writers if the practice continued for contempt of court. In January 2008, the court affirmed the national government's decision not to hold municipal elections due to budgetary constraints and allowed the President of Liberia to appoint mayors. The court determined that once money was available, the government must hold the elections, which had not been held since 1985. He resigned from the court in September 2012 citing health issues, with September 10 as his last day in office.

Issues relating to biofuels

There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating oil prices, the "food vs fuel" debate, poverty reduction potential, carbon emissions levels, sustainable biofuel production, deforestation and soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, impact on water resources, the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as energy balance and efficiency. The International Resource Panel, which provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of resource-related themes, assessed the issues relating to biofuel use in its first report "Towards sustainable production and use of resources: Assessing Biofuels". In it, it outlined the wider and interrelated factors that need to be considered when deciding on the relative merits of pursuing one biofuel over another. It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.
Social and economic impacts.
Oil price moderation.
The International Energy Agency's "World Energy Outlook 2006" concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked,
would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. The report suggested that biofuels may one day offer a viable alternative, but also that "the implications of the use of biofuels for global security as well as for economic, environmental, and public health need to be further evaluated".
According to Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist for Merrill Lynch, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. Gordon Quaiattini, president of the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association, argued that a healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.
"Food vs. fuel" debate.
"Food vs fuel" is the debate regarding the risk of diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production in detriment of the food supply on a global scale. Essentially the debate refers to the possibility that by farmers increasing their production of these crops, often through government subsidy incentives, their time and land is shifted away from other types of non-biofuel crops driving up the price of non-biofuel crops due to the decrease in production. Therefore, it is not only that there is an increase in demand for the food staples, like corn and cassava, that sustain the majority of the world's poor but this also has the potential to increase the price of the remaining crops that these individuals would otherwise need to utilize to supplement their diets. A recent study for the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development shows that market-driven expansion of ethanol in the US increased maize prices by 21 percent in 2009, in comparison with what prices would have been had ethanol production been frozen at 2004 levels. A November 2011 study states that biofuels, their production, and their subsidies as leading causes of agricultural price shocks. The counter-argument includes considerations of the type of corn that is utilized in biofuels, often field corn not suitable for human consumption; the portion of the corn that is used in ethanol, the starch portion; and the negative effect higher prices for corn and grains have on government welfare for these products. The "food vs. fuel" or "food or fuel" debate is internationally controversial, with disagreement about how significant this is, what is causing it, what the impact is, and what can or should be done about it.
Poverty reduction potential.
Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have argued that biofuels could help to reduce poverty in the developing world, through increased employment, wider economic growth multipliers and by stabilising oil prices (many developing countries are net importers of oil). However, this potential is described as 'fragile', and is reduced where feedstock production tends to be large scale, or causes pressure on limited agricultural resources: capital investment, land, water, and the net cost of food for the poor.
With regards to the potential for poverty reduction or exacerbation, biofuels rely on many of the same policy, regulatory or investment shortcomings that impede agriculture as a route to poverty reduction. Since many of these shortcomings require policy improvements at a country level rather than a global one, they argue for a country-by-country analysis of the potential poverty impacts of biofuels. This would consider, among other things, land administration systems, market coordination and prioritizing investment in biodiesel, as this 'generates more labour, has lower transportation costs and uses simpler technology'. Also necessary are reductions in the tariffs on biofuel imports regardless of the country of origin, especially due to the increased efficiency of biofuel production in countries such as Brazil.
Sustainable biofuel production.
Responsible policies and economic instruments would help to ensure that biofuel commercialization, including the development of new cellulosic technologies, is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and impoverished Asia.
Environmental impacts.
Soil erosion and deforestation.
Large-scale deforestation of mature trees (which help remove CO2 through photosynthesis — much better than sugar cane or most other biofuel feedstock crops do) contributes to un-sustainable global warming atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, loss of habitat, and a reduction of valuable biodiversity (both on land as in oceans). Demand for biofuel has led to clearing land for palm oil plantations. In Indonesia alone, over of forest have been converted to plantations since 1996.
A portion of the biomass should be retained onsite to support the soil resource. Normally this will be in the form of raw biomass, but processed biomass is also an option. If the exported biomass is used to produce syngas, the process can be used to co-produce biochar, a low-temperature charcoal used as a soil amendment to increase soil organic matter to a degree not practical with less recalcitrant forms of organic carbon. For co-production of biochar to be widely adopted, the soil amendment and carbon sequestration value of co-produced charcoal must exceed its net value as a source of energy.
Some commentators claim that removal of additional cellulosic biomass for biofuel production will further deplete soils.
Impact on water resources.
Increased use of biofuels puts increasing pressure on water resources in at least two ways: water use for the irrigation of crops used as feedstocks for biodiesel production; and water use in the production of biofuels in refineries, mostly for boiling and cooling.
In many parts of the world supplemental or full irrigation is needed to grow feedstocks. For example, if in the production of corn (maize) half the water needs of crops are met through irrigation and the other half through rainfall, about 860 liters of water are needed to produce one liter of ethanol. However, in the United States only 5-15% of the water required for corn comes from irrigation while the other 85-95% comes from natural rainfall.
In the United States, the number of ethanol factories has almost tripled from 50 in 2000 to about 140 in 2008. A further 60 or so are under construction, and many more are planned. Projects are being challenged by residents at courts in Missouri (where water is drawn from the Ozark Aquifer), Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas (all of which draw water from the non-renewable Ogallala Aquifer), central Illinois (where water is drawn from the Mahomet Aquifer) and Minnesota.
For example, the four ethanol crops: corn, sugarcane, sweet sorghum and pine yield net energy. However, increasing production in order to meet the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act mandates for renewable fuels by 2022 would take a heavy toll in the states of Florida and Georgia. The sweet sorghum, which performed the best of the four, would increase the amount of freshwater withdrawals from the two states by almost 25%.
Loss of biodiversity.
Critics argue that expansion of farming for biofuel production causes unacceptable loss of biodiversity for a much less significant decrease in fossil fuel consumption. The loss of biodiversity also makes heavy dependence on biofuels very risky by reducing our ability to deal with blights affecting the few important biofuel crops.
Food crops have recovered from blights when the old stock was mixed with blight resistant wild strains, but as biodiversity is lost to excessive agriculture, the possibilities for recovering from blights are lost.
Pollution.
Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and other aldehydes are produced when alcohols are oxidized. When only a 10% mixture of ethanol is added to gasoline (as is common in American E10 gasohol and elsewhere), aldehyde emissions increase 40%. Some study results are conflicting on this fact however, and lowering the sulfur content of biofuel mixes lowers the acetaldehyde levels. Burning biodiesel also emits aldehydes and other potentially hazardous aromatic compounds which are not regulated in emissions laws.
Many aldehydes are toxic to living cells. Formaldehyde irreversibly cross-links protein amino acids, which produces the hard flesh of embalmed bodies. At high concentrations in an enclosed space, formaldehyde can be a significant respiratory irritant causing nose bleeds, respiratory distress, lung disease, and persistent headaches. Acetaldehyde, which is produced in the body by alcohol drinkers and found in the mouths of smokers and those with poor oral hygiene, is carcinogenic and mutagenic.
The European Union has banned products that contain Formaldehyde, due to its documented carcinogenic characteristics. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has labeled Formaldehyde as a probable cause of cancer in humans.
Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas chromatograph studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo Brazil, and compared to Osaka Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.
Technical issues.
Energy efficiency and energy balance.
Production of biofuels from raw materials requires energy (for farming, transport and conversion to final product, and the production / application of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides), and has environmental consequences.
The energy balance of a biofuel (sometimes called "Net energy gain" and EROEI) is determined by the amount of energy put into the manufacture of fuel compared to the amount of energy released when it is burned in a vehicle. This varies by feedstock and according to the assumptions used. Biodiesel made from sunflowers may produce only 0.46 times the input rate of fuel energy. Biodiesel made from soybeans may produce 3.2 times the input rate of fossil fuels. This compares to 0.805 for gasoline and 0.843 for diesel made from petroleum.
Biofuels may require higher energy input per unit of BTU energy content produced than fossil fuels: petroleum can be pumped out of the ground and processed more efficiently than biofuels can be grown and processed. However, this is not necessarily a reason to use oil instead of biofuels, nor does it have an impact on the environmental benefits provided by a given biofuel.
Studies have been done that calculate energy balances for biofuel production. Some of these show large differences depending on the biomass feedstock used and location.
To explain one specific example, a June 17, 2006 editorial in the Wall. St. Journal stated, "The most widely cited research on this subject comes from Cornell's David Pimental and Berkeley's Ted Patzek. They've found that it takes more than a gallon of fossil fuel to make one gallon of ethanol — 29% more. That's because it takes enormous amounts of fossil-fuel energy to grow corn (using fertilizer and irrigation), to transport the crops and then to turn that corn into ethanol."
Life cycle assessments of biofuel production show that under certain circumstances, biofuels produce only limited savings in energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilizer inputs and transportation of biomass across large distances can reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) savings achieved. The location of biofuel processing plants can be planned to minimize the need for transport, and agricultural regimes can be developed to limit the amount of fertiliser used for biomass production. A European study on the greenhouse gas emissions found that well-to-wheel (WTW) CO2 emissions of biodiesel from seed crops such as rapeseed could be almost as high as fossil diesel. It showed a similar result for bio-ethanol from starch crops, which could have almost as many WTW CO2 emissions as fossil petrol. This study showed that second generation biofuels have far lower WTW CO2 emissions.
Other independent LCA studies show that biofuels save around 50% of the CO2 emissions of the equivalent fossil fuels. This can be increased to 80-90% GHG emissions savings if second generation processes or reduced fertiliser growing regimes are used. Further GHG savings can be achieved by using by-products to provide heat, such as using bagasse to power ethanol production from sugarcane.
Collocation of synergistic processing plants can enhance efficiency. One example is to use the exhaust heat from an industrial process for ethanol production, which can then recycle cooler processing water, instead of evaporating hot water that warms the atmosphere.
Biomass planting mandated by law (as in European Union) results in large quantities of biomass being transported to EU from Africa, Asia and Americas (Canada, USA, Brazil). For example in Poland as much as 85% of biomass used is imported from outside of EU, with single electric plant in Łódź importing over 7'000 tons of wood biomass from Republic of Komi (Russia) over distance of 7'000 kilometers on monthly basis.
T. A. Kiefer of the US Air Force Air War College, in a paper entitled "The False Promise of Liquid Biofuels", laid out factors that preclude biofuels from replacing petroleum as a national-scale transportation fuel. Kiefer states “The energy content of the final-product biofuel compared to the energy required to produce it proves to be a very poor investment, especially compared to other alternatives. In many cases, there is net loss of energy." He concludes “...pursuit of biofuels creates irreversible harm to the environment, increases greenhouse gas emissions, undermines food security, and promotes abuse of human rights." 
Solar energy efficiency.
Biofuels from plant materials convert energy that was originally captured from solar energy via photosynthesis. A comparison of conversion efficiency from solar to usable energy (taking into account the whole energy budgets) shows that photovoltaics are 100 times more efficient than corn ethanol and 10 times more efficient than the best biofuel. However, photovoltaics produce electricity rather than storable, portable liquid hydrocarbon fuel, so they are largely irrelevant for powering the large existing fleet of vehicles and equipment having internal combustion engines. Green plants are self-assembling organisms and therefore much cheaper to produce than photovoltaic cells.
Carbon emissions.
Biofuels and other forms of renewable energy aim to be carbon neutral or even carbon negative. Carbon neutral means that the carbon released during the use of the fuel, e.g. through burning to power transport or generate electricity, is reabsorbed and balanced by the carbon absorbed by new plant growth. These plants are then harvested to make the next batch of fuel. Carbon neutral fuels lead to no net increases in human contributions to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, reducing the human contributions to global warming. A carbon negative aim is achieved when a portion of the biomass is used for carbon sequestration. Calculating exactly how much greenhouse gas (GHG) is produced in burning biofuels is a complex and inexact process, which depends very much on the method by which the fuel is produced and other assumptions made in the calculation.
The carbon emissions (carbon footprint) produced by biofuels are calculated using a technique called Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). This uses a "cradle to grave" or "well to wheels" approach to calculate the total amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted during biofuel production, from putting seed in the ground to using the fuel in cars and trucks. Many different LCAs have been done for different biofuels, with widely differing results. Several well-to-wheel analysis for biofuels has shown that first generation biofuels can reduce carbon emissions, with savings depending on the feedstock used, and second generation biofuels can produce even higher savings when compared to using fossil fuels. However, those studies did not take into account emissions from nitrogen fixation, or additional carbon emissions due to indirect land use changes.
A paper published in February 2008 in Sciencexpress by a team led by Searchinger from Princeton University concluded that once considered indirect land use changes effects in the life cycle assessment of biofuels used to substitute gasoline, instead of savings both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. A second paper published in the same issue of Sciencexpress, by a team led by Fargione from The Nature Conservancy, found that a carbon debt is created when natural lands are cleared and being converted to biofuel production and to crop production when agricultural land is diverted to biofuel production, therefore this carbon debt applies to both direct and indirect land use changes.
The Searchinger and Fargione studies gained prominent attention in both the popular media and in scientific journals. The methodology, however, drew some criticism, with Wang and Haq from Argonne National Laboratory posted a public letter and send their criticism about the Searchinger paper to Letters to Science. Another criticism by Kline and Dale from Oak Ridge National Laboratory was published in Letters to Science. They argued that Searchinger et al. and Fargione et al. "..."do not provide adequate support for their claim that biofuels cause high emissions due to land-use change". The U.S. biofuel industry also reacted, claiming in a public letter, that the ""Searchinger study is clearly a "worst case scenario" analysis..."" and that this study ""relies on a long series of highly subjective assumptions..."".
Modifications necessary to internal combustion engines.
The modifications necessairy to run internal combustion engines on biofuel depend on the type of biofuel used, as well as the type of engine used. For example, gasoline engines can run without any modification at all on biobutanol. Minor modifications are however needed to run on bioethanol or biomethanol. Diesel engines can run on the latter fuels, as well as on vegetable oils (which are cheaper). However, the latter is only possible when the engine has been foreseen with indirect injection. If no indirect injection is present, the engine hence needs to be fitted with this.
Campaigns.
A number of environmental NGOs campaign against the production of biofuels as a large scale alternative to fossil fuels. For example, Friends of the Earth state that "the current rush to develop agrofuels (or biofuels) on a large scale is ill-conceived and will contribute to an already unsustainable trade whilst not solving the problems of climate change or energy security". Some mainstream environmental groups support biofuels as a significant step toward slowing or stopping global climate change. However, supportive environmental groups generally hold the view that biofuel production can threaten the environment if it is not done sustainably. This finding has been backed by reports of the UN, the IPCC, and some other smaller environmental and social groups as the EEB and the Bank Sarasin, which generally remain negative about biofuels.
As a result, governmental and environmental organizations are turning against biofuels made in a non-sustainable way (hereby preferring certain oil sources as jatropha and lignocellulose over palm oil) and are asking for global support for this. Also, besides supporting these more sustainable biofuels, environmental organizations are redirecting to new technologies that do not use internal combustion engines such as hydrogen and compressed air.
The "Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels" is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable is developing a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production through meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions.
The increased manufacture of biofuels will require increasing land areas to be used for agriculture. Second and third generation biofuel processes can ease the pressure on land, because they can use waste biomass, and existing (untapped) sources of biomass such as crop residues and potentially even marine algae.
In some regions of the world, a combination of increasing demand for food, and increasing demand for biofuel, is causing deforestation and threats to biodiversity. The best reported example of this is the expansion of oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, where rainforest is being destroyed to establish new oil palm plantations. It is an important fact that 90% of the palm oil produced in Malaysia is used by the food industry; therefore biofuels cannot be held solely responsible for this deforestation. There is a pressing need for sustainable palm oil production for the food and fuel industries; palm oil is used in a wide variety of food products. The "Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels" is working to define criteria, standards and processes to promote sustainably produced biofuels. Palm oil is also used in the manufacture of detergents, and in electricity and heat generation both in Asia and around the world (the UK burns palm oil in coal-fired power stations to generate electricity).
Significant area is likely to be dedicated to sugar cane in future years as demand for ethanol increases worldwide. The expansion of sugar cane plantations will place pressure on environmentally sensitive native ecosystems including rainforest in South America. In forest ecosystems, these effects themselves will undermine the climate benefits of alternative fuels, in addition to representing a major threat to global biodiversity.
Although biofuels are generally considered to improve net carbon output, biodiesel and other fuels do produce local air pollution, including nitrogen oxides, the principal cause of smog.
Politics.
Steven Rattner, former "auto czar" for U.S. President Barack Obama, wrote an Op-ed for "The New York Times" in June, 2011, entitled "The Great Corn Con," characterizing ethanol as "an example of government policy run amok." Along with the economic and environmental impacts of the U.S. policy, he noted the impact of the issue on presidential politics:
Those hopefuls have seen no need for a foolish consistency. John McCain and John Kerry were against ethanol subsidies, then as candidates were for them. Having lost the presidency, Mr. McCain is now against them again. Al Gore was for ethanol before he was against it. This time, one hopeful is experimenting with counter-programming: as governor of corn-producing Minnesota, Tim Pawlenty pushed for subsidies before he embraced a "straight talk" strategy.
Rattner did not address President Obama's long-time alignment with Illinois and U.S. corn producers on the issue.

Ghost Town (Bill Frisell album)

Ghost Town is the 12th album by Bill Frisell to be released on the Elektra Nonesuch label. It was released in 1999 and is the first album featuring solo performances, overdubs and loops, by Frisell.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Rick Anderson states "To call the music he creates on this album "introspective" would be something of an understatement... there's a darkness around the edges this time out that is unusual, as if he's lonely playing by himself and a little bit unnerved at the thoughts and feelings he's being forced to face on his own... There are moments of light relief, such as the gently lovely title track and the brief banjo interlude "Fingers Snappin' and Toes Tappin'," but the overall mood here is relatively dark, though consistently beautiful".

Elliott &amp; Fry

Elliott & Fry was a Victorian photography studio founded in 1863 by Joseph John Elliott and Clarence Edmund Fry. For a century the firm's core business was taking and publishing photographs of the Victorian public and social, artistic, scientific and political luminaries. In the 1880s the company operated three studios and four large storage facilities for negatives, with a printing works at Barnet. 
The firm's first address was 55 & 56 Baker Street in London, premises they occupied until 1919. The studio employed a number of photographers, including Francis Henry Hart and Alfred James Philpott in the Edwardian era, Herbert Lambert and Walter Benington in the 1920s and 1930s and subsequently William Flowers. During World War II the studio was bombed and most of the early negatives were lost, the National Portrait Gallery holding all the surviving negatives. With the firm's centenary in 1963 it was taken over by Bassano & Vandyk.
Joseph John Elliott.
Joseph John Elliott (14 October 1835 Croydon – 30 March 1903 Hadley Heath, near Barnet) the son of John and Mary Elliott, he married Clarence's sister, Elizabeth Lucy Fry (24 June 1844 Plymouth – 23 February 1931), in Brighton on 20 August 1864, eventually producing 4 sons and 3 daughters. Elliott's partnership with Fry was dissolved on 31 July 1887, Elliott acquiring Fry's interest. Elliott's partnership with his own son, Ernest C. Elliott, was dissolved on 31 December 1892. Ernest went on to compile an album of 50 British sportsmen, "Fifty Leaders of British Sport", published in 1904.
Clarence Edmund Fry.
In 1865 Clarence Edmund Fry (Plymouth 1840 – 1897) married Sophia Dunkin Prideaux (*1838 Modbury Devon), who was a photographic colourist. Clarence Edmund Fry was an early patron of Hubert von Herkomer, who in 1873 moved to Bushey apparently to be near his benefactor, and to start the "Herkomer Art School".
Clarence was the eldest son of Edmund Fry and Caroline Mary Clarence (1809–1879), both members of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, and related to Joseph Storrs Fry, founder of the Bristol chocolate factory.
Clarence's siblings were:
In 1867 the second eldest son, Walter Henry Fry, joined the youngest brother, Allen Hastings Fry, and started the photography firm of W. & A. H. Fry of 68 East Street, Brighton.

BikeTown Africa

BikeTown Africa ("BTA") was founded in 2006 two bicycle riding friends, David B. and Steve M. Between 2006 - 2012, Bike Town Africa has delivered more than 2,000 new, custom made bicycles to health care workers in sub-Saharan Africa. It has operated largely as a partnership between "Bicycling Magazine", Rodale Institute, Bristol Myers Squibb, UTi, and Kona Bicycle Company. In 2013 Bike Town Africa incorporated as a stand-alone 501(c)3 organization in the United States ("final IRS status pending"). Each year, BTA donates bicycles (and tools) to healthcare workers in Africa, particularly those involved in HIV/AIDS related work. BTA volunteers travel to Africa to assemble and give away the bicycles to the receiving organization (typically an established, qualified HIV clinic, hospital or NGO). BTA then documents the impact these bicycles have on the personal and professional lives of the recipients. Besides health care workers BikeTown Africa has also donated bicycles to orphans and farmers as well as worked in other countries outside of Africa; notably Afghanistan.
History.
The project started in 2006 with 200 bicycles donated to HIV/AIDS healthcare workers in Gaborone and Bobanang, Botswana.
In 2007 the project expanded. One hundred and fifty bicycles were distributed in Katima Mulilo, Namibia, and 169 in Tambacounda, Senegal.
One thousand AfricaBikes were donated in 2008. These bicycles were distributed in South AfricaSwaziland and Mozambique. In 2009, 750 bicycles were distributed. During September 2009, an international team of volunteers assembled 268 bicycles in the Orange Farm township of Gauteng, South Africa. These were donated to the [http://www.cathca.co.za/ Catholic Healthcare Association of South Africa for distribution to their affiliates in South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland. The final two projects for 2009 happened in Kibaha and Bukoba, Tanzania.
In March 2010, 100 Specialized Fuse BMX bikes were distributed to 4 tracks built by AMA Rider for children in townships around Cape Town. In August 2010, 120 Kona AfricaBikes will be distributed in Malawi at the Baylor Tingathe Community Outreach Program. A further 120 bicycles will be donated to Foundation Rwanda. In September 2010 250 bikes were distributed in The Gambia, with assistance from the HopeFirst Foundation.
In 2011, BikeTown Africa was approached by AMARider to assist with its children's mountain biking league. BikeTown Africa volunteers traveled to Lesotho to work with Lesotho Cycling Association in building a cyclocross track and providing 33 mountain bicycles for any and all school children to use for a season of four races. The track was built on the Lesotho Olympic Training grounds in Maseru. After the series of races during the season, all 33 bicycles were handed over to the children who performed best on and off the track.
In 2012 Bike Town Africa traveled to Mwanza, Tanzania to assemble and give away 100 bicycles to HIV healthcare workers at the Baylor Pediatric AIDS Hospital there.
The primary bicycles used in BikeTown Africa is called the Kona AfricaBike. It was designed by Kona Bicycle Company to fit the unique needs of health care workers in Africa. Over the project life span the bicycles has undergone various changes and additions. BikeTown Africa also has distributed bicycles manufactured by Specialized.
As with the bicycle, the project is constantly adapting so as to utilize best practices learned. In 2007 BikeTown Africa changed some of its policies insisting that the bicycles must be owned by the individual recipients rather than the organization, so as to promote personal responsibility of the maintenance and repair of the bicycles. In return each recipient agrees to volunteer with the organization for a fixed amount of time or devote an agreed amount of time to help sustain the project. Recipients in Lesotho earned their bicycles through attending races, cleaning up rubbish in the city and good attendance at school.
BikeTown Africa also includes training for mechanics in the areas the bicycles are distributed, as well as providing tools to equip the trained mechanics.
Current status.
As of July 2013, the last status update on the Facebook page is a year old. The Kona website still lists the AfricaBike 3 for sale, but links to the project are all no longer active. A search of the current Rodale, Inc. and The Rodale Institute websites returns 'There are no results for "AfricaBike".' The last mention of BikeTown Africa in "Bicycling" magazine is in 2009. The last tweet was on October 28, 2010. On January 4, 2011, Maria Rodale, then CEO and Chairman of Rodale, Inc., published an article about BikeTown Africa in "The Huffington Post".

The Wrestling Federation of Singapore's belt system is the first belt system to ever be adopted by a national governing body for wrestling in the world. This unique system was designed by a committee made up of national coaches from both Russia and the United States, and it has a total of 9 levels of belts ranging from the Yellow Belt and advancing to a 4th degree of Black Belt. The initial belts are based on the number of approved techniques mastered and the more advanced belts require increasingly difficult levels of success in actual competition.
The Yellow Belt requires that a wrestler demonstrate a mastery of 8 qualified techniques or participation in 60 training sessions. The Orange Belt requires a demonstrated mastery of 20 qualified techniques or participation in 120 training sessions.
The techniques were designed by USA Coach of the Year & Former Lehigh University Coach Tom Hutchinson, Coach & NCAA All-American Pete Schuyler and Sergei Beloglazov. http://www.singaporesports.sg/News/tabid/60/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1086/Top-US-Wrestling-Coach-Tom-Hutchinson-speaks.aspx

Crummey trust

In the United States a Crummey trust (named for the first person to use such a structure) is a trust for the benefit of individuals into which gifts are made in a manner qualifying them for exclusion from the unified gift and estate tax.
Normally, gifts to minors are subject to parental / guardian control until the age of majority. In order to delay the transfer of control beyond the age of 18, the funds must be placed in trust. However, the annual gift exclusion ($14,000 per individual and $28,000 per married couple as of 2013) from the gift tax is only available for gifts of so-called "current interests". Normally, a gift into a trust that comes under control of the beneficiary at a future date does not constitute a current interest.
A Crummey trust achieves the desired treatment by offering the recipient a window of time (often 30 days) to take immediate control of the gift. (The control offered only applies to the current gift--by assumption, an amount no greater than the annual exclusion amount--not the entire trust.) If the recipient fails to do so during that window, the gift becomes part of the trust, and is subject to the trust's distribution conditions. However, since the recipient had the opportunity to receive the funds outside of the trust, the gift is deemed to be a current interest, subjecting it to the annual exclusion.
The expectation of future annual gifts under the same mechanism (or the expectation of the withholding of such future gifts if the recipient exerts control over the gift) may motivate the recipient to relinquish control of the funds into the trust.
Use in life insurance trusts.
In addition, similar provisions are often added to life insurance trusts or "ILITs" in order to maintain the annual gift tax exclusion by funding the ILIT using Crummey powers. This way additional gifts and beneficiaries can be taken advantage of to fund the life insurance trust. If executed properly the beneficiaries will receive the proceeds of the life insurance trust free of income or estate taxes.

Okinoerabujima

The island, 93.63  km² in area, has a population of approximately 15,000 persons. Administratively it is divided into the towns of Wadomari and China in Kagoshima Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of the Amami Guntō Quasi-National Park.
Geography.
Okinoerabujima is isolated from the other Amami islands, and is located in between Tokunoshima and Yoronjima, approximately south of the southern tip of Kyūshū and north of Okinawa.
The island is an elevated coralline island with a length of approximately and width of , with Mount Ōyama at above sea level at its highest peak. . In the eastern part of the island is an extensive limestone cave system, one of the largest in Asia. The coast of the island is surrounded by a coral reef.
Climate.
Okinoerabujima has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification "Cfa") with very warm summers and mild winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is somewhat lower in winter. The island is subject to frequent typhoons.
Fauna.
Okinoerabujima is home to several rare species of reptiles and insects endemic to the island itself, or more generally to the Ryukyu archipelago. The "habu" poisonous viper is common on the island.
History.
It is uncertain when Okinoerabujima was first settled. It was ruled by the Aji nobility who built numerous gusuku fortifications from the 8th century onwards . From 1266 is was part of the Hokuzan Ryukyu Kingdom. The island was invaded by samurai from Satsuma Domain in 1609 and its incorporation into the official holdings of that domain was recognized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1624. Satsuma rule was harsh, with the inhabitants of the island reduced to serfdom and forced to raise sugar cane to meet high taxation, which often resulted in famine. The island was subordinate to Tokunoshima from 1616 to 1690, when an independent "daikansho" was established. Throughout the Satsuma period, the island was used as prison settlement, especially for political offenders, including many members of the Ryukyu royal family. Saigo Takamori was exiled to Okinoerabujima from 1862-1864.
After the Meiji Restoration the island was incorporated into Ōsumi Province and later became part of Kagoshima Prefecture. Following World War II, although with the other Amami Islands, it was occupied by the United States until 1953, at which time it reverted to the control of Japan. In September 1997, a massive typhoon (Typhoon Babe (1977)) devastated the island, which experienced winds in excess of for two hours as the typhoon passed by. Nearly two-thirds of the homes across the island were damaged or destroyed by the storm and 73 people were injured. Most of the injuries across the island were caused by collapsing buildings.
Economy.
With moderate rainfall and a warm climate, the island is suitable for agriculture. Main crops include sweet potatoes, sugar cane and floriculture. Brown sugar refining and the production of distilled "shochu" liquor is the major industry. The island is not a major tourist destination, unlike many in the Amami archipelago.
Transportation.
The port of Wadomari, located in the town the same name has regular ferry services to Okinawa and Kagoshima and Kobe. The smaller port of China, in the town of China, has ferries to Kagoshima and other of the Amami islands.
Okinoerabu Airport, in Wadomari, is located on the island.

Rapstrap is a system of securing and bundling together cables, ropes, plants, etc. It is a reusable plastic strap that is wrapped around the cables, plants, or supports and then cut to size, similarly to cable ties. However, unlike cable ties, the excess that is cut off can be used again.
Dragons' Den.
The inventor of rapstrap, Andrew Harsley, appeared on the "Dragons' Den" TV show in 2008, and was able to sell 50% of his company for £150,000. He made a deal with two dragons, James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne.
Since then, one of the world's leading plastics distributors Hitachi-Maxell had secured a £36m contract for the rapstrap, making it the biggest success story of "Dragons' Den".
Patent.
In March 2009, the UK's Intellectual Property Office said that the "Rapstrap" had characteristics that could infringe patents owned Millepede Marketing Ltd. Millepede was set up by Harsley, who subsequently left to found Rapstrap. This is not a legal opinion and Millepede have to prove this through the courts. This finding does not allow Millepede to demand for licensing or insist on a halt of production or sales without going through the courts.

In genetics, rs7341475 is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the "RELN" gene that codes the reelin protein. The gene RELN is mapped to human chromosome 7 (7q22.1). The SNP rs7341475 is located in the fourth intron of RELN. The gene RELN has many more SNPs among its 65 exons and 64 introns, — even in intron 4 there are tens of SNPs.
The SNP is currently under investigation for a possible link to schizophrenia.
A 2008 genome-wide association study pointed to that a variant of the SNP could elevate the risk for schizophrenia among women.

The Energy Ball V100 is a spherical small wind turbine for small scale energy production, produced by Home Energy International. The annual yield is up to 15% of the energy demand of an average household.
The turbine is characterized by the 6 curved turbine blades which form a sphere.
The Energy Ball uses the venturi effect: due to the shape of the turbine blades the wind is accelerated creating a low pressure area within the sphere, thereby using a larger area of wind than wind turbines of comparable diameter.

Anne Lofthus

Anne Lofthus Valla (29 February 1932 - 6 October 2003) was a Norwegian ceramic artist and art teacher. Her artistic style was influenced by the folk-culture of rural Norway, in particular the cultural traditions from Telemark, where she was born and grew up. 
Background.
Anne Lofthus was born at the Lofthus Farm in the municipality of Vinje in Telemark, and died in the municipality of Hemnes in Nordland County, Norway. From 1954 to 1957 she was educated as a ceramist at the Norwegian College of Applied Arts in Oslo, with Jens von der Lippe as supervisor. She was employed in von der Lippe's workshop as a ceramist from 1958 to 1959. She married the teacher and farmer Torbjørn Valla in 1967 and moved to Korgen in the municipality of Hemnes. There, she continued teaching and also accepted many freelance assignments. 
Artistic career.
From 1959 to 1963 she was engaged as a designer at the Stavangerflint AS earthenware factory in Stavanger, Norway where she served as a member of the company's artistic staff under the directorship of Kåre Berven Fjeldsaa. While employed at Stavangerflint, Anne Lofthus created designs for ceramic tableware and items for decoration or special occasions. She also made many souvenir objects for cities and tourist sites in Norway and abroad. Her most famous designs for tableware are "Tiril", "Vinge" and the children's set "Du som metter liten fugl" (Lord you feed the little bird). 
She left Stavangerflint in 1963 and in 1963/64 she continued her education at the National School for Teaching of Woodwork and Drawing in Notodden, Norway. In subsequent years she worked as a teacher, giving lessons in Arts and Crafts while continuing to work as a ceramist. Anne Lofthus created the coat of arms for the Norwegian community of Hemnes and established her own ceramic workshop at Valla, Norway where she was active until 1996.
Her style as an artist is usually easily recognizable by her references to Norwegian Folk Art, such as the décor-objects "Stolt Margit" and "Folklore" both of which are based on inspiration from the cultural heritage of the Telemark region.

Cronista Rey de Armas

The Chronicler King of Arms in the Kingdoms of Spain was a civil servant who had the authority to grant armorial bearings. The office of the King of Arms in Spain originated from those of the heralds (Heraldos). In the early days of heraldry, anyone could bear arms and as is normal where human beings are involved there arose disputes between individuals and families. These disputes were originally settled by the King, in the case of a dispute between nobles or by a lower ranked official when the dispute involved non-nobles. Eventually, the task of settling these disputes was passed on to officials called heralds who were originally responsible for setting up tournaments and carrying messages from one noble to another. 
The Spanish Cronista de Armas heraldic office dates back to the 16th century. But prior to that, heralds were usually named after provinces and non-capital cities, whilst reyes de armas were named after the Spanish kingdoms. Various chroniclers of arms were named for Spain, Castile, León, Frechas, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Granada (created in 1496 to honor the reunification of Spain), Estella, Viana, Navarre, Catalonia, Sicily, Aragon, Naples, Toledo, Valencia and Majorca. While these appointments were not hereditary, at least fifteen Spanish families produced more than one herald each in the past five hundred years (compared to about the same number for England, Scotland and Ireland collectively). The Spanish Cronistas had judicial powers in matters of noble titles. They also served as a registration office for pedigrees and grants of arms.
Appointments to the Corps of King of Arms were made by the King or reigning Queen. These appointments were for life and while not intended to be hereditary, often went from father to son or other close family member. The Spanish heralds had other duties which pertained to matters of protocol and often acted as royal messengers and emissaries. They could, and can, make arrangements for areas currently or previously under the rule of the Spanish crown. The precise functions and duties of the King of Arms were clearly defined by the declarations of several Kings and are still in force today.
In modern times the Corps of Chronicler King of Arms went through several changes. Important changes were made in 1915, it was abolished in 1931 and restored in 1947–1951. The last Chronicler Kings of Arms appointed by the Spanish Ministry of Justice was Don Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent, died in 2005. 
The government of the autonomous community of Castile and León has appointed Don Alfonso Ceballos-Escalera y Gil, Marques de la Floresta as (Chronicler of Arms for Castile and León). Don Alfonso also serves as personal heraldic officer to the King of Spain Juan Carlos I. Formerly, everything that the Spanish Heralds did had to be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Justice for it to be valid. Legislation by Castile and León established the Chronicler King of Arms for Castile and León as the modern equivalent of the Spanish King of Arms.

Intel Xeon chipsets

Around the time that the Pentium 3 processor was introduced, Intel's Xeon line diverged from its line of desktop processors, which at the time was using the Pentium branding.
The divergence was implemented by using different sockets; since then, the sockets for Xeon chips have tended to remain constant across several generations of implementation.
The chipsets contain a 'memory controller hub' and an 'I/O controller hub', which tend to be called 'north bridge' and 'south bridge' respectively. The memory controller hub connects to the processors, memory, high-speed I/O such as PCI Express, and to the I/O controller hub by a proprietary link. The I/O controller hub on the other hand, connects to lower-speed I/O, such as hard discs, PCI slots, USB and Ethernet.
P6-based Xeon chipsets.
Dual processor P6-based Xeon chipsets.
Intel's initial preferred chipset for Pentium III Xeon was the 840.
Four processor P6-based Xeon chipsets.
The Pentium III Xeon bus protocol allowed four processors on the same bus, so the 440GX AGPset could be used in four-CPU systems; the limit of 2GB of main memory remained. These support Slot 2.
There was also the 450NX PCIset, which consisted of several chips: a single 82451NX Memory and IO Bridge Controller roughly analogous to the North Bridge, up to two 82454NX PCI Expander Bridges which converted the protocol used by 451NX to two 32-bit PCI33 or one 64-bit PCI33 bus, along with up to two memory cards each equipped with one 82452NX RAS/CAS Generator chip and two 82453NX Data Path Multiplexer chips. It supported PIIX3 and PIIX4E south bridges, and EDO DRAM.
Eight processor P6-based Xeon chipset.
In August 1999 Intel began shipping the Profusion PCIset. The chipset was based on technology developed by the Corollary company, which Intel acquired. It supported up to 8 Pentium III Xeon processors on two busses and maintained cache coherency between them. Profusion supported up to 32 GB of memory. It saw some limited competition from the NEC Aqua II chipset. Another minor player in the eight-way space was Axil Computer's NX801, which was used in an 8-way (two buses) Pentium Pro design, commercialized by Data General as their AV-8600 computer.
NetBurst-based Xeon chipsets.
Dual processor NetBurst-based Xeon chipsets.
E7500 corresponded to the first Northwood-based Pentium4 Xeons, E7501 is essentially identical but supports faster FSB and memory. The E7320, E7520 and E7525 chipsets correspond to Prescott-based Pentium4 Xeons, and differ mainly in their PCI Express support. These support Socket 604.
Note that the 82870P2 chips mentioned above were initially designed for the Intel 870 chipset for Itanium 2, and that the summary page of the E7320 datasheet incorrectly claims three PCI Express interfaces.
Core-based Xeon chipsets.
Dual processor Core-based Xeon chipsets.
These chipsets use a 'dual independent bus' design, in which each socket has its own connection to the chipset. These support LGA 771.
Four processor Core-based Xeon chipsets.
This chipset uses four independent buses, and is used by the Tigerton and Dunnington processors.
Nehalem-based Xeon chipsets.
Single processor Nehalem-based Xeon chipsets.
The 3450 chipset is also compatible with an Intel Core i5 or Intel Core i3 processor.
Dual processor Nehalem-based Xeon chipsets.
The Nehalem-based Xeons for dual-socket systems, initially launched as the Xeon 55xx series, feature a very different system structure: the memory controllers are on the CPU, and the CPUs can communicate with one another as peers without going via the chipset. This means that the 5500 and 5520 chipsets are essentially QPI to PCI Express interfaces; the 5520 is more intended for graphical workstations and the 5500 for servers that do not need vast amounts of PCI Express connectivity

Gro Pedersen Claussen

Gro Pedersen Claussen (born 1941) Norwegian graphic designer at the earthenware factory Stavangerflint AS in Stavanger, Norway, (1963–1967) and textile designer at Sandvika Veveri, Bærum, Norway (1977–2004). Her many designs on ceramic objects like "Per Spelemann", "Ut etter øl" and "Venner" are sought after by collectors of industrial ceramic objects from Norway.
Biography.
Gro Pedersen Claussen was born in Stavanger, Norway . She was educated as a graphic designer at the Stavanger Technical College (1958–1961). Previously she had taken courses in drawing at The Stavanger Drawing School. Later on she also took lessons at an art school in ceramics.
From 1963 to 1967 she was employed as a designer at the earthenware factory Stavangerflint AS, Hillevåg, Norway. She moved to the eastern part of Norway in 1967 but continued to create designs for Stavangerflint on a freelance basis to 1975. From 1977 Gro Pedersen Claussen worked as a textile designer for Sandvika Veveri in Bærum, Norway. She resigned in 2006 after 29 years of duty for the company.
The designer.
Her most famous designs for Stavangerflint AS are those for the gift and collector items “Per Spelemann” and “Ut etter øl”, based on traditional Norwegian songs. She also created the design for the children’s sets ”Bæ, bæ, lille lam” and ”Venner”. She created the design for the tea, dinner and breakfast tableware on forms made by the company's design director, Kåre Berven Fjeldsaa. In addition, she created a large number of souvenir objects with motifs from Norway and abroad. 
At Sandvika Veveri she made designs that were printed on fabrics such as jute, linen and cotton. The source material for patterns constituted the largest part of the production. The fabrics were usually not credited the artists, but many of Gro Pedersen Claussens designs are known through printed promotional material and coverage in periodicals and newspapers. In 1992, in close cooperation with the Directorate for Cultural Heritage in Norway, she designed the carpet for the reception hall at the Eidsvoll Building in Eidsvoll where the Norwegian Constitution was agreed on in 1814.

Beardmore W.B.2

The Beardmore W.B.2, also known as the Beardmore W.B.II was a British fighter monoplane prototype of the 1910s.
Development.
A two-seat fighter of wooden construction, the W.B.2 was built as a private venture by William Beardmore and Company, based on an original design called the B.E.2c designed by G. Tilghman-Richards in . Powered by a 200 hp Hispano-Suiza 8Bd engine, it carried two guns and design finished early in 1917 with the production of the first prototype.
Operational history.
The W.B.2 was first flown on 30 August 1917, and performance proved good. However, the Air Ministry deemed that the 8Bd engine, at that time in short supply, was needed more urgently for use in the S.E.5a fighter at that time serving with the Royal Flying Corps in World War I. As such, no further production of the W.B.2 took place, however in 1920 two civil examples were produced, named the W.B.IIB.

Ragnar Sohlman

Ragnar Sohlman (born February 26, 1870, in Stockholm; died July 9, 1948, at the Karolinska hospital, Solna) was a Swedish chemical engineer, manager, civil servant, and creator of the Nobel Foundation.
Biography.
Ragnar Sohlman was born in Stockholm, son to August Sohlman, a well-known newspaper man, and his wife Hulda Maria Sandeberg. In 1887, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated as a chemical engineer in 1890.
In 1893 Sohlman became the assistant of Alfred Nobel in San Remo, and Nobel's will from 1895 named him and Rudolf Lilljequist as executors, with Sohlman expected to do most of the work. The will stated:
The sum of 100.000 crowns was a very significant amount at the time, and made Sohlman a wealthy man. The amount can be compared to the prize amount of the first Nobel Prizes in 1901, 150.782 crowns each.
After Alfred Nobel's death on December 10, 1896, Sohlman was occupied for several years with the task of realizing Nobel's intentions of establishing the Nobel Prize. Since the will did not contain detailed regulations regarding selection of laurates and was contested by Nobel's relatives, the task kept Sohlman and his advisors occupied for several years. Sohlman was a member of the interim board of the Nobel Foundation.
Sohlman also had a career as engineer and manager in Nobel-related companies, such as Bofors. He was also the director general of the Swedish National Board of Trade 1935-1936.
He was the executive director of the Nobel Foundation 1929-1946.
He son was a Swedish diplomat and his grandson Michael Sohlman is the present executive director of the Nobel Foundation.

Oscar de Négrier

François Oscar de Négrier (2 October 1839 – 22 August 1913) was one of the most charismatic French generals of the Third Republic, winning fame in Algeria in the Sud-Oranais campaign (1881) and in Tonkin during the Sino-French War (August 1884 – April 1885).
Early career.
Born in Belfort, France on 2 October 1839, De Négrier served with Marshal François Achille Bazaine's Army of the Rhine during the Franco-Prussian War, and was among the thousands of French officers who laid down their arms when Bazaine surrendered his army at Metz. He subsequently escaped from Prussian captivity and joined the armies of national defence for the rest of the war.
Sino-French War.
De Négrier arrived in Tonkin in February 1884, and was given command of the 2nd Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. During the period of undeclared hostilities that preceded the Sino-French War he took part in the Bắc Ninh Campaign (March 1884) and the subsequent campaign to capture Hưng Hóa (April 1884). In June 1884 he was sent by General Charles-Théodore Millot, the general-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, to the aid of Colonel Alphonse Dugenne with a relief column when the news of the Bắc Lệ ambush reached Hanoi.
During the Sino-French War he commanded the three French columns involved in the Kep Campaign (October 1884). The largest of these columns, under his personal command, defeated the right wing of the Cinese Guangxi Army at the Battle of Kep (8 October). De Négrier was wounded in the leg in this battle, and fell from his horse. His troops, believing that he had been killed, gave no quarter to the Chinese defenders when they stormed the village of Kep. In January 1885 de Négrier won the Battle of Núi Bop, often considered his professional masterpiece. In February 1885 he commanded the 2nd Brigade in the Lạng Sơn Campaign, in which the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps drove the Chinese from their entrenched camps at Dong Song and Bac Vie and captured Lạng Sơn. 
Immediately after the French capture of Lạng Sơn, General Louis Brière de l'Isle returned to Hanoi with Lieutenant-Colonel Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade to relieve the Siege of Tuyên Quang, leaving de Négrier at Lang Son with the 2nd Brigade. On 23 February 1885 de Négrier advanced from Lang Son and defeated the demoralised Guangxi Army at Đồng Đăng, close to the Chinese border, driving the Chinese out of Tonkin altogether. De Négrier briefly crossed into Guangxi province and blew up the Gate of China, an elaborate ceremonial gate erected by the Chinese at Zhennan Pass to mark the border between China and Annam.
The Chinese reinforced the Guangxi Army in March 1885, and on 22 March a detachment of Chinese troops from the command of Feng Zicai crossed into Tonkin and raided the French forward positions at Đồng Đăng. To discourage further incursions by the Chinese, de Négrier decided to pursue the raiders across the frontier with the bulk of the 2nd Brigade and attack the Chinese in their entrenched camp at Bang Bo near Zhennan Pass, hoping that the element of surprise would make up for his lack of numbers. On 23 March the French took the outworks of the Chinese camp at Bang Bo, but on 24 March 1885 further attacks on the Chinese miscarried, and de Négrier was forced to make a fighting retreat. The Battle of Bang Bo was the only defeat he suffered in his entire military career. 
The Guangxi Army cautiously pursued the French, and four days later launched a disastrous frontal attack on the defences of Lạng Sơn. The battle of Ky Lua, on 28 March 1885, was a walkover victory for the French, but de Négrier was shot in the chest and seriously wounded while scouting the Chinese positions in preparation for a French counterattack, and was forced to hand over command to Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Gustave Herbinger, one of his two regimental commanders. Herbinger, a theoretical soldier with little experience of command in the field, lost his head. More than a thousand Chinese corpses lay in front of the 2nd Brigade's positions, and the Chinese could be seen falling back in disorder towards the frontier, leaving only a small rearguard at Ky Lua to protect their retreat. Herbinger was unimpressed. Ignoring all the evidence that the Guangxi Army had been decisively defeated, and convinced that the 2nd Brigade would be encircled if it remained where it was, he took the controversial decision to abandon Lạng Sơn and fall back to stronger defensive positions at Kep and Chu. This misjudgement transformed de Négrier's tactical victory at Ky Lua into a strategic defeat.
Later career.
De Négrier quickly recovered from his Ky Lua wound, and in May 1885, shortly after the end of the Sino-French War, was appointed to the command of the 2nd Division of the expanded Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. General Brière de l'Isle had been offered command of the 1st Division, and made it a condition of his acceptance that de Négrier got the 2nd Division. De Négrier was not at his best serving under General Roussel de Courcy. Instead of fighting set-piece battles against Chinese regular troops in which his tactical abilities had every opportunity to shine, he was required to conduct punitive sweeps against elusive Vietnamese guerilla concentrations. In December 1885 he swept the Bai Sai region near Hanoi with a column of 3,000 men. The sweep netted few guerillas, and French casualties from cholera in de Négrier's column were heavy. The exasperated French bayoneted any prisoners they took and de Négrier, a traditional soldier who found it difficult to adapt to the tactics of guerilla warfare, did nothing to stop them. The net result of this brutal campaign was probably to win more recruits and increase sympathy for the insurgents.
De Négrier was attached to the Imperial Japanese Army as an official French observer during the Russo-Japanese War, and published an account of the war, "Lessons from the Russo-Japanese War" (London, 1905), immediately after its close.
De Négrier's leadership.
De Négrier was by far the most popular French commander in Tonkin during the Sino-French War. After the Bắc Ninh Campaign the soldiers of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps devised sardonic Vietnamese nicknames for General Charles-Théodore Millot and his two brigade commanders. De Négrier, admired for his driving energy, became "Maolen" (mau lên, 'Quick!'). Louis Brière de l'Isle, whose troops had been beaten to the punch at Bac Ninh by de Négrier's, was "Mann Mann" (màn màn, 'Slow!'). Millot, who had halted de Négrier's pursuit of the beaten Chinese army at Kep and, in the eyes of the soldiers, prevented him from going all the way to Lang Son, became "Toi Toi" (thôi thôi, 'Stop!').
De Négrier had a way with words that endeared him to most French soldiers. His most famous "mot" was made in December 1883 in Algeria, during a review of the 2nd Battalion of the French Foreign Legion on the eve of its departure for Tonkin to take part in the Bắc Ninh Campaign: "Vous, légionnaires, vous êtes soldats pour mourir, et je vous envoie où l’on meurt!" ('Legionnaires, you became soldiers in order to die, and I'm taking you to a place where you "can" die!')
De Négrier possessed to a high degree the quality known to the French as "coup d'oeil", the ability to make an instant assessment of the battlefield and make the appropriate response. Sergeant Maury of the 2nd Legion Battalion witnessed de Négrier in action at the Battle of Pho Vy (10 February 1885), one of the many confused engagements against the Chinese during the Lạng Sơn Campaign:
Suddenly we stopped being spectators, and took a part in the action ourselves. General de Négrier rode over to give some orders to de Saxcé's battery, which we were still guarding, and called out to our captain, 'Cotter, have you got your whole company up?' 'Sir.' He turned to the battery captain. 'Your battery’s not in any danger, is it, de Saxcé?' 'Sir.' 'Right! Cotter, take your company and capture that hill. Those damned Chinese don't seem to want to be pushed off it.' Then he turned to us. 'Let's go, lads! Chins up, forward march! Show them you don't use your knives just to eat your rations!'
De Négrier had a hasty temper, but it was redeemed by a ready sense of humour, and his troops relished his occasional volcanic eruptions. Second Lieutenant René Normand of the 111th Line Battalion (killed in action a month later in the Battle of Bang Bo) recalled a typical incident during the Lạng Sơn Campaign in February 1885:General de Négrier began to concentrate his brigade. The column was moving forward slowly, in single file, and as he watched it he remarked to us, 'The thing about warfare is that you have to learn to be patient.' No sooner were the words out of his mouth than a cannon bogged down. He spurred towards the wretched gun section. 'Oh, for God's sake! Keep the damned thing moving!' Then he burst out laughing, and that set us all off.

James Dark

James Henry Dark (1795–1871) was an English professional cricketer who later became a noted patron of the sport and was, from 1835 to 1864, the proprietor of Lord's Cricket Ground. He was the brother of Benjamin Dark.
Career as player and umpire.
born 24 May 1795 at Marylebone, London. An occasional wicket-keeper, Dark was mainly associated with Middlesex and he made 17 known appearances in first-class matches from 1815 to 1843. In 1835, he represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Dark was described as "a good hitter and fieldsman". He was a respected umpire who stood intermittently from 1829 to 1860.
Proprietor of Lord's.
Dark used his earnings from cricket to become a property owner and developer. When an opportunity arose to buy the leasehold at Lord's, Dark was quick to seize it.
The current Lord's Cricket Ground was opened by Thomas Lord in 1814, the ground sited on land that Lord leased from the Eyre Estate in St John's Wood. In 1825, Lord proposed building houses on the land as he was not receiving enough revenue from cricket. There was strong opposition to his idea and he sold his leasehold interest in the ground to William Ward for £5000.
In 1835, Ward sold the leasehold to Dark who paid £2000 upfront and an annuity of £425 to the Ward family through the unexpired term of the lease from Michaelmas Day 1835 for 59 years (to 1894). The rental due to the Eyre Estate was £150 per annum.
Dark lived close by the ground in a house which was "near the present (in 1945) members' luncheon room".
Dark did much to improve Lord's. When he took over, there were two ponds on the land which frequently filled up with rubble and the playing area had a very rough surface. The ponds were eventually drained and filled in while ground maintenance relied to a large extent on sheep to keep the grass down and a small roller to even out the surface. Dark's development programme was ambitious for it included extension and improvement of the pavilion and the installation of gas lighting. He added a billiard room, a real tennis court, a running track and planted 400 trees. He struggled to improve the notoriously bad pitch and some of his extra attractions, such as pony racing and Red Indian encampments, cannot have helped the condition of the outfield.
Dark brought his family into Lord's to help develop the business. His brother Ben established a bat-making business at the ground and their younger brother Robert sold a whole range of equipment including the new pads and gloves that players were beginning to prefer to Muscular Christianity.
In 1860, there was a potential crisis at Lord's when the Eyre Estate decided to sell the freehold at public auction. Dark was among many who urged MCC to bid but, for any number of reasons including a lack of vision, they did not and the ground was bought by Isaac Moses, a property speculator, for £7000. Dark resigned the leasehold in 1864 and it was taken over by MCC. In 1866, using funds advanced by William Nicholson, MCC did buy the freehold from Moses for £18,333 6s 8d, which was not good business: they should have heeded James Dark.
Character and personal life.
The son of a saddler, Dark was connected with Lord's in some capacity for 59 years from 1805 to 1864 and it was said of him in Alfred D Taylor's "Annals of Lord's and History of the MCC": "having, perhaps, done more for MCC than any other individual". During his period of proprietorship, the ground was often referred to in common parlance as Dark's.
Known as "the Boss", Dark was described as "a somewhat taciturn, silent man, out of who information was not easily extracted".
Dark died 17 October 1871 at St John's Wood, London at the age of 76 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery where a red granite slab was erected with the inscription: "Sacred to the Memory of Mr James Henry Dark, who died October 17th 1871, aged 76. For many years Proprietor of Lord's Cricket Ground".

1962–63 FA Cup

The 1962–63 FA Cup was the 82nd staging of the world's oldest football cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup. Manchester United won the competition for only the third time, beating Leicester City 3–1 in the final at Wembley. 
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. Some matches, however, might be rescheduled for other days if there were clashes with games for other competitions or the weather was inclement. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
Results.
First Round Proper.
At this stage clubs from the Football League Third and Fourth Divisions joined those non-league clubs having come through the qualifying rounds. Matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 3 November 1962. Nine were drawn and went to replays. 
Second Round.
The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 24 November 1962. Two matches were drawn, with replays taking place later the same week. 
Third Round.
The 44 First and Second Division clubs entered the competition at this stage. The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 5 January 1963, but due to the Big Freeze of 1963, only three games were completed at this date. The bulk of matches were not completable until February and March, with the final non-replay tie being played on the 7 March. There were nine replays in total, of which the earliest possible playing date was 30 January, and the latest the 11 March.
Fourth Round.
The matches were originally scheduled for Saturday, 26 January 1963, but due to the earlier, ongoing problems with the winter of 1963, most of the third round games had still not been played and only one tie, the Burnley – Liverpool match, was able to be played on that day. This and three other games went to a replay, with the Portsmouth – Coventry City match requiring a second replay, which was the last match of the round. 
Fifth Round.
The matches were originally scheduled for Saturday, 16 February 1963, but the delays of the matches in the third and fourth rounds prevented the fifth round ties from being played until much later. On 28 January, the FA announced that the draw for the fifth round would be put back a week, and that the league season would be extended until 19 May. Faced with the problem of wishing all the ties to take place on the same date, the FA decided on 4 February 1963 that the fifth and sixth rounds would each be postponed by a week to 23 February and 16 March respectively The following week, on 12 February, the FA again decided, due to the lack of completion of many games, that the fifth and sixth rounds should be postponed The agreed dates, Saturday 16 March and Saturday 30 March respectively, were the final postponements of these two rounds. There were no replays, but the Nottingham Forest and Leeds United match did not take place until the following Tuesday, while the Coventry City – Sunderland game was played on the 25th.
Sixth Round.
The four quarter-final ties were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 9 March 1963, but as explained above, were postponed until the 30 March. The Nottingham Forest–Southampton match went to two replays before the tie was settled, in Southampton's favour.
Semi finals.
The semi-final matches were originally scheduled to be played on Saturday, 30 March 1963. However, due to the problems of completing the earlier rounds due to the particularly inclement weather, on 18 February 1963 the FA Challenge Cup committee announced that the semi finals would be put back by four weeks to 27 April, and that the final would not be played until three weeks after its original date, on 25 May. Leicester City and Manchester United came through the semi final round to meet at Wembley.
Final.
The 1963 FA Cup Final was a football match played on 25 May 1963 at Wembley. The final was contested by Manchester United and Leicester City. United won 3–1, with goals by Denis Law and David Herd (2). Ken Keyworth scored the Foxes' goal.

Kværner-process

The Kværner-process or Kværner carbon black & hydrogen process (CB&H) is a method, developed in the 1980s by Aker Solutions of Norway, for the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons (CnHm), such as methane, natural gas and biogas.
Description.
The hydrocarbons are separated into their components, carbon and hydrogen in a plasma burner (see Plasma, Electric arc) at around 1600 C.
Reaction: formula_1 
The biggest advantage over all other known reformation methods (steam reforming, partial oxidation, etc.) is that the natural gas is transformed 100% into pure carbon and hydrogen in an energy-efficient way.
Of the available energy of the feed, approximately 48% is contained in the hydrogen, 40% is contained in activated carbon and 10% in superheated steam.
Plasma variation.
A variation of this process using plasma arc waste disposal was presented in 2009. Methane and natural gas is converted to hydrogen, heat and carbon using a plasma converter.

Adriana Cavarero

Adriana Cavarero (born 1947 in Bra, Italy) is an Italian philosopher and feminist thinker. She holds the title of Professor of Political Philosophy at the Università degli studi di Verona. She has also held visiting appointments at the University of California, Berkeley and Santa Barbara, at the New York University and Harvard. Cavarero is widely recognized in Italy, Europe and the English-speaking world for her writings on feminism and theories of sexual difference, on Plato, on Hannah Arendt, on theories of narration and on a wide range of issues in political philosophy and literature.
Biography.
Cavarero was educated at the University of Padua, where she wrote a thesis on philosophy and poetry, in 1971, and spent the first years of her Academic career. In 1983 she left Padua for the University of Verona, where she was co-founder of "Diotima" – a group dedicated to feminist philosophy as political engagement. Trained in ancient philosophy – with a special focus on the writings of Plato – and inspired by feminist philosopher, Luce Irigaray, Cavarero first drew wide attention with her book, "In Spite of Plato", which pursues two interwoven themes: it engages in a deconstruction of ancient philosophical texts, primarily of Plato, but also of Homer and Parmenides, in order to free four Greek female figures (a "Thracian servant", "Penelope", "Demeter" and "Diotima") from the patriarchal discourse which for centuries had imprisoned them in a domestic role. Secondly, it attempts to construct a symbolic female order, reinterpreting these figures from a new perspective. By contaminating the theory of sexual difference with Arendtian issues, Cavarero shows that, while death is the central category on which the whole edifice of traditional philosophy has been based, the category of birth provides the thread with which new concepts of feminist criticism can be woven together to establish a fresh way of thinking.
Work.
Cavarero's interest in the intersection of political philosophy and feminist thought was further developed in "Stately Bodies" which examines the bodily metaphor in political discourse and in fictional depictions of politics, including Sophocles' "Antigone", Plato's "Timaeus", Shakespeare's "Hamlet", Hobbes' "Leviathan", Maria Zambrano's "The Tomb of Antigone" and Ingeborg Bachmann's "Undine Goes". The book explores:
Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood (2000).
Definitively influenced by the work of Hannah Arendt, Cavarero wrote "Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood" in which she developed an original theory of selfhood as a "narratable self". Appreciated and discussed by Judith Butler in "Giving an Account of Oneself", this book, by contrasting the sovereign subject of the metaphysical tradition, confronts with the urge of rethinking politics and ethics in terms of a relational ontology, characterized by reciprocal exposure, dependence and vulnerability of an incarnated self who postulates the other as necessary. In fact, through readings of such diverse figures as Homer, Sophocles, The Arabian Nights, Isak Dinesen and Gertrude Stein, "Relating Narratives" presents a singular contribution to the intersection of narrative theory, ethics and political discourse.
Cavarero claims that we perceive ourselves as narratable, as protagonists of a story that we long to hear from others. This desire for a story, for our story to be told, becomes the guiding element in the new approach to identity. Our identity is not possessed in advance, as an innate quality or inner self that we are able to master and express. It is rather the outcome of a relational practice, something given to us from another, in the form of a life-story, a biography.
For More Than One Voice: Toward a Philosophy of Vocal Expression (2005).
Cavarero's next book, "For More Than One Voice: Toward a Philosophy of Vocal Expression", "re-think(s) the relation between speech and politics – announced in Aristotle's formula whereby man's nature as a political animal politikon is bound up with man's characterization as that animal which has speech logon echon – by focusing her attention on the embodied uniqueness of the speaker as it is manifested in that speaker's voice, addressed to another. In this way, she radically departs from more traditional conceptions of what constitutes 'political speech,' such as the signifying capacity of the speaker, the communicative capacity of discourse, or the semantic content of a given statement. As in her earlier work, Cavarero continues to develop and deepen a number of themes foregrounded by Hannah Arendt—who asserts in "The Human Condition" that what matters in speech is not signification or 'communication' but rather the fact that 'in acting and speaking, men show who they are, reveal actively their unique personal identities and thus make their appearance in the human world.'. Refining the radically phenomenological perspective that Arendt puts forth in her work, Cavarero locates the political sense of speech in the singularity of the speaker's voice, the acoustic emission that emits from mouth to ear. For Cavarero this politic emerges from 'the reciprocal communication of voices,' wherein what comes to the fore is above all the embodied singularity of the speakers in relation to others, no matter what they say.
Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence (2008).
In her most recent book, Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence, Cavarero draws attention to various ways in which scenes of violence from the past century through the present (as well as what might be called ancient and early modern precursors to these scenes) cannot be adequately understood through the received categories of modern political philosophy -- 'terrorism,' 'war,' 'friend/enemy,' or 'state versus non-state sanctioned actions' -- and proposes a decisive shift in perspective. Taking note of the fact that, increasingly, we are dealing with victims who are almost all unarmed or defenseless – "inermi," defenseless/helpless – she argues that it is precisely this helplessness and these particular helpless people whose conditions and circumstances ought to orient our thinking about scenes of violence, rather than the socio-political aims or psychoanalytical perspectives of the perpetrators. Cavarero proposes the name "horrorism" for those forms of violence that are "crimes" which "offend the human condition at its ontological level." Pairing, unexpectedly, Hannah Arendt's notion of natality and Thomas Hobbes' description of maternal dominion as the power to "nourish or destroy," Cavarero elaborates this ontology as one of "vulnerability" – a reciprocal exposure in which we are given over to either the other's care or harm, "almost as if the absence of harm or care were not even thinkable". She argues that it is precisely this alternative between care and doing harm – and not some "pure, gratuitous cruelty" – that is the "generative nucleus" of horror, precisely because this vulnerability is the condition of human life as it is given from birth to death. Horrorism is, so to speak, a radical rejection of care – a wound inflicted precisely where care was most needed. Therefore, the violence strikes more deeply at the "dignity" of the unique, bodily life that is harmed; or better, because horror is a form of violence that is made possible by the heightened vulnerability of helplessness, it also implicitly reveals this dignity.

Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg (born August 2, 1929), M. A., Ph.D., is a German sociologist, ethnologist, sexologist, and writer further specializing into the fields of psychology, Indo-European studies, religious studies, and philosophy, since 1980 also increasingly anthropology. As Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg uses these approaches in research particularly in the fields of sexology, homophobia, and prejudice studies, the US "Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists" (SOLGA; formerly "Anthropology Research Group on Homosexuality", ARGOH) of the American Anthropological Association ranked Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's works on homophobia as internationally outstanding.
Biography.
Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg studied sociology, psychology, ethnology, religious studies, philosophy and "Indogermanistik" (an interdisciplinarian German subject, not identical with purely linguistic Indo-European studies in Anglophone countries, consisting of historical, sociological, cultural, religious, ethnological, philological, and linguistic study relating to Proto-Indo-European and Indo-European peoples and Indo-European languages) in Bonn.
In 1969, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg graduated at the University of Bonn, receiving her "Magister artium" (comparable to a Master's degree in the Anglo-American educational system) for her thesis "Homosexualität und Transvestition im Schamanismus" ("Homosexuality and transvestition in shamanism"). In 1970, she received her Ph.D. for her doctoral dissertation on "Sexuelle Abartigkeit im Urteil der abendländischen Religions-, Geistes-, und Rechtsgeschichte im Zusammenhang mit der Gesellschaftsentwicklung" ("The religious, philosophical, and legal construction of sexual deviance in interdependence with the development of Western society").
After university studies Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg became a scientific assistant at the Sociological Institute of Bonn University, and worked as a sociologist, writer, and independent journalist, holding memberships in a number of scientific and political organizations. She was a leading member of "German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research". During the late 1980s, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member of the German-parliament commissioned "Enquetekommission AIDS", an inquiry commission researching into the disease's social, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, a cooperation which spawned her 1989 book "Angst und Vorurteil" (see below).
Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is married and lives in Germany.
Fields of interest & influences.
"Ethno-sociologist".
A label commonly applied to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is that of an "ethno-sociologist", even though that is not to limit her approaches exclusively to non-Western cultures. Her inclusion of ethnological, cross-cultural approaches serves as one device of many that she uses to globally study and analyze mankind's nature and nurture as well as the differences and interdependencies between the two, aiming for a global perspective also applicable in modern industrialized societies.
Fields of interest.
Following the ideology-critical and identity-critical approach of Frankfurt School's Critical Theory, the emphasis of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's mostly post-structural and deconstructionist work (see social constructionism and social constructivism) on socio-psychological prejudice studies lies on the socio-cultural, socio-historical, and socio-psychological research into issues such as Western repression of sensuality ("Leibfeindlichkeit") in Indo-European cultures, and extends into research on topics such as deviant sexuality, homophobia, misogyny, gender roles, and patriarchy.
Deconstructivism & essentialism.
Most of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's research is dedicated to cultural deconstruction of ethnocentric Western prejudices, analyzing their origins and later derivations in history, and emphasizes that this cultural nurture also determining social identities must not be misunderstood as man's essentialist human nature. According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, positivist misinterpretation of ethnocentric prejudices as human nature is one of the key maladies of Western civilization, known to Critical Theory as society's totality also influencing much of Western scientific output. For instance, gays were throughout most of Western history said to be effeminate "by their nature", while this common stereotype also influenced social identities and behaviors of individual homosexuals, and these resulting identities and behaviors were in turn taken by society as justifying evidence for their prejudice.
Only two of her works, "Mannbarkeitsriten" (1980) and "Der pädophile Impuls" (1985/88) deal with anthropological research into the essential cross-cultural and cross-species nature of two particular sexual attractions beyond common Western stereotypes, paederasty (which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg defines as "male same-sex paedophilia") in "Mannbarkeitsriten", and paedophilia (defined as "sexual contact between fertile adults and infertile juveniles" based upon preference for these activities on behalf of the adult side, rather than situational offences) in general in "Der pädophile Impuls".
Influences.
In her publications on prejudice studies, both general and specifically sexual deviance-related, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg incorporates influences of Critical Theory (especially the theory of "Authoritarian personality", also see Right-wing authoritarianism), "Labeling theory" by George Herbert Mead and Howard S. Becker, "Social identity theory" by Henri Tajfel and John Turner, "Frustration-Aggression hypothesis" by John Dollard and Neal E. Miller, "Social learning theory" by Albert Bandura, "dispositif" and "discourse analysis" by Michel Foucault, and the concept of "derivation" in the sociological sense of the term by Vilfredo Pareto, denoting an irrational, ideological after-the-fact rationalization. Other notable influences include Sigmund Freud, Mircea Eliade, Marija Gimbutas (though only acknowledged by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg as a summary source for a century of scholarly Central European and Scandinavian "Indogermanistik" publications prior to Gimbutas), the concepts of "magical thinking" by James George Frazer and of "the numinous" by Rudolf Otto.
Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's definition of prejudice is largely identical to Theodor W. Adorno's "Verblendungszusammenhang", by which Adorno denotes socially constructed "delusions" ("Verblendungen") based upon traditional socio-cultural and socio-psychological conditions or relations ("Verhältnisse") within Western society, but also takes influence from Foucault's "dispositif" or "apparatus", whereas according to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, traditional ethnocentric prejudices easily adapt to social paradigm shifts throughout history in order to update their rationalizations according to dominant epistemes, with new derivations of the same old prejudices as the result. For example, during the Medieval Age, according to Benedictus Levita, Thomas Aquinas, and the Malleus Maleficarum, same-sex activities were abhorred as the most deadliest sin of all, which was "superbia", i. e. the very pride to consider oneself above God and disobey His will as manifested in His most sacred commandments such as that "sodomia" (see sodomy), the common Medieval term for these activities, was considered identical to satanism and evil witchcraft, whereas when with the scientific revolution of Early Modernity the responsibility of priests towards sinners increasingly transformed into one of doctors and judges toward those now considered criminally insane, the rationale to keep the ban upon the very same activities along with the ostracization of those who committed such unspeakable "abominations" changed to emphasizing the alleged counter-naturality or perversion of their acts and pathologizing those who desired such.
Combining her influences, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's synthetized definition of ethnocentric, inherently Authoritarian prejudice is one of socially learned manifest, recurring intrusive thoughts ("Zwangsvorstellungen") that may spill over into Allport's Scale discrimination, including violent hate crimes, as a form of obsessive-compulsive behavior ("Zwangshandlung"; also see Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder). Due to what Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg terms "distorted perception" ("verzerrte Wahrnehmung", resembling Bob Altemeyer's "compartmentalized thinking") of constructed social reality, the prejudiced aggressor regards themselves as a rectifying, maybe curing agent, as an upholder of "natural order" and "society", and/or as protector of people they perceive as "victims" of the discriminated.
Main works.
Overview.
Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's main works consist of the following publications:
Of interest to Anglophone readers might also be Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's English-language publications not mentioned above:
"Tabu Homosexualität" (1978).
"Tabu Homosexualität" is considered a foundational standard work in Germanophone research into homophobia, misogyny, patriarchy, general repression of sensuality and particularly repression of sexual deviance ("Leibfeindlichkeit"). In spite of not having been translated into any other language as of 2008, since its first publication "Tabu Homosexualität" remains treated and quoted as a standard source internationally as well. As of 2008, it is found in a number of Western European libraries, and in the US is even available in libraries in 13 different states.
According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural studies, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society. Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural strata (see stratification (archeology), social stratification, and archaeological horizon) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures.
From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations in Indo-European societies until the 20th century.
"Angst und Vorurteil" (1989).
The book "Angst und Vorurteil - AIDS-Ängste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung" was based on the work of the parliamentary inquiry commission "Enquetekommission AIDS", of which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member, that was formed in order to research into the disease's social, cultural, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, as well as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's own final report brought forth in parliamentary hearings and towards the Helmut Kohl administration.
In "Angst und Vorurteil", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg on the one hand supplements the structural history of Western "Leibfeindlichkeit" (repression of sensuality) she related at a fuller scope in "Tabu Homosexualität" before, by pointing out in "Angst und Vorurteil" further aspects she had already brushed on in "Der pädophile Impuls" four years earlier.
On the other hand, in "Angst und Vorurteil" Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg gives a thorough, comprehensive description of post-WWII scientific prejudice studies, particularly regarding the re-inforcement of traditional Western "Leibfeindlichkeit" (prejudices directed against factual or putative sexual deviance) triggered by HIV, and chronicles the field's academic history from its roots. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's understanding of prejudice largely builds on Critical Theory and its concept of the Authoritarian personality, but also incorporates, among other schools of prejudice studies, Labeling theory, Social identity theory, Frustration-Aggression hypothesis, Social learning theory, and Foucault's "dispositif" and discourse analysis.

Sanjay Gandhi Jaivik Udyan

Sanjay Gandhi Jaivik Udyan (also known as Sanjay Gandhi Botanical and Zoological Garden or Patna Zoo) is located near Bailey Road in Patna, Bihar, India. The park was opened to the public as a zoo in 1973. The park is Patna's most frequented picnic spot, with more than 36,000 visitors on New Year's Day alone in 2011.
History.
The Park was first established as a Botanical Garden in 1969. The then Governor of Bihar, Sri Nityanand Kanungo, provided almost of land from the Governor House campus for the garden. In 1972, Public Works added to this, and the Revenue Department transferred to the Forest Department to help expand the park.
Since 1973, this park has been a biological park, combining a botanical garden with a zoo. The land acquired from the Public Works Department and the Revenue Department was declared Protected Forest by the State Government on 8 March 1983.
Animals and exhibits.
The zoo is currently home to over 800 animals of about 110 species, including tiger, leopard, clouded leopard, hippopotamus, crocodile, Elephants, Himalayan black bear, jackal, black bucks, spotted deer, peafowl, hill myna, gharial, python, Indian rhinoceros, giraffe, and zebra, emu, and white peacock.
Having started as a botanical garden, the park currently contains more than 300 species of trees, herbs and shrubs. Plant exhibits include a nursery for medicinal plants, an orchid house, a fern house, a glass house, and a rose garden.
The park also includes an aquarium which is the largest revenue generator after the general admission fee. The aquarium has about 35 species of fish, and the snake house has 32 snakes belonging to 5 species.
Conservation and births.
The Patna Zoo makes considerable effort to conserve and propagate endangered species from around the world. Breeding captive wild animals is a difficult challenge that the zoo has met with some notable success.

Timura trilogy

The Timura Trilogy or The Complete Timuras comprises three fantasy books written by American author Allan Cole. The setting is a fantasy world where the aspiring wizard Safar Timura, and his childhood friend and conqueror Iraj Protarus aim to unite the humans and, their common enemy, the demons. While the protagonist Timura is important to Protarus, and serves as his Grand Wazier, Protarus wants more power and betrays his friend and becomes the antagonist of the books.
The three volumes are entitled Wizard of the Winds, Wolves of the Gods, and The Gods Awaken. The first one is also known as "When the Gods Slept" in Great Britain.
Safar Timura is loosely based on Omar Khayyam
The Norwegian composer Bjørn Lynne has made three albums based on the three books, all of them with written narration by Allan Cole. This narration is read by Cris Blyth at the start of each track in the first album as well as the final track on the last album.

Balisor

Balisor is a system of illuminated beacons for high voltage power lines using a cold-cathode low-pressure neon lamp 
Description.
High voltage power cables, particularly those close to airports, need to be visible day and night. During the day, brightly coloured balls positioned along the length of the cables are sufficient, but during the night, lighting is necessary. These beacons which emit a red glow (the standard colour used in aviation for warning beacons) are used to provide this lighting.
The system is extremely simple, efficient and reliable and is considered the most economically viable solution. Its working principle is attractive because it uses a phenomenon usually considered as a weakness. However a large disadvantage is that it does not work when the line is switched-off. It cannot also be used on HVDC-powerlines, but similar devices may be also used on mast radiators.
Operating principle.
The interest of the system lies in the way it obtains a power supply directly from the single cable on which it is mounted. It is difficult to obtain a very small amount of energy from a line which transports an enormous amount. 
Each high voltage cable creates an electric field around itself, in the same way as any live electrical conductor. When the electric potential of such a cable is sufficiently high, its electric field causes a significant voltage difference between the cable and its immediate neighbour. (It is the strength of the electric field that makes it difficult use low powers.)
As a result, a second conductor a few metres long, insulated from but parallel to the high voltage cable, will have a potential different from that of the main cable. Together the conductors make a capacitor charged across an air gap (dielectric).
Under certain conditions, the accumulated charge (and hence the potential difference) is sufficient to trigger a discharge lamp. This what is used in practice, giving a reliable and robust beacon.

1993 Sugar Bowl

The 1993 Sugar Bowl took place on January 1, 1993, in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It served as the final game and the National Championship of the 1992–93 college football season. The game featured two unbeaten teams in the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Miami Hurricanes. This game marked the first National Championship selected by the Bowl Coalition, a predecessor to the current Bowl Championship Series.
Alabama was sent to the National Championship following their 28–21 victory over the Florida Gators in the inaugural SEC Championship Game. Miami, from the Big East, was led by Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Gino Torretta, and was playing for back-to-back undefeated seasons and consecutive National Championships.
Though Miami were favorites to claim the victory, Alabama's defense held the Hurricanes to just 13 points, while intercepting Torretta three times, en route to a 34–13 victory to claim their 12th National Championship. Alabama rushed for 267 yards—67 more yards than the Hurricanes had allowed all season.
A legendary play in Alabama football lore, known as "The Strip", occurred when Miami wide receiver Lamar Thomas caught a pass and sprinted for an 89-yard touchdown throw from Torretta, when Alabama's George Teague caught him from behind, stripped the ball from him, and started running the other way before being tackled. The play became famous following Thomas's pre-game comments regarding the SEC, the superiority of the Miami receiving corps, and the manhood of the Alabama defensive backs. The play was negated by an Alabama offside penalty, but the strip was still successful in preventing a Miami touchdown on the play, as Miami would have simply declined the penalty had the strip not taken place. At one point, the Tide lined up all eleven players up to the line of scrimmage, confusing Torretta, which led to an interception returned for a touchdown.
Following the poor performance, some reporters began to question whether Torretta deserved the Heisman.

Joint replacement of the hand

Joint replacement of the hand is a procedure that was invented by the Scottish scientist, Dr. Mitchell McGuire. The procedure was considered a major breakthrough in the medical field at the time. However, it is now considered an almost standard operation. The first successful surgery of this kind was conducted on 21 December, 1992, in New York City, USA.
This surgical option is reserved for patients with advanced arthritis or with a hand deformity.
Arthritic joint replacement.
Merging of a joint involves removing the joint and surgically "fusing" the joint's end so that the two bones effectively form one solid bone. This surgery stops all movement at that joint and therefore eliminates the pain. The benefit of fusion is pain relief and the downside is elimination of motion at the fused joint, which can hinder function. Arthritic joint replacements are usually the most effective surgical option in more youthful and active patients. Younger patients may not be candidates for joint replacement because of the increased stress demand on the joints which accompany higher activity levels. This increased stress demand can quickly wear out an artificial joint.
Deformity joint replacement.
For those with a hand deformity, the surgical procedure varies slightly. Instead of the joint being removed and replaced with a prosthetic hand, a hand from a donor is used.

<doc id="19244424" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19244424" title="Foodpairing">
Foodpairing

Foodpairing is a method for identifying which foods go well together. The method is based on the principle that foods combine well with one another when they share key flavor components. Foodpairing is a relatively new method and is often confused with wine and food matching. By contrast, foodpairing uses HPLC, gas chromatography and other laboratory methods to analyse food and to find chemical components that they have in common.
Not to be confused with protein combination theory for vegetarians and vegans.
Introduction.
The foodpairing method is designed to inspire chef, foodies, home cooks and food engineers. The method aids recipe design and provides new possible food combinations, which are theoretically sound on the basis of their flavor.
Foodpairing provides possible food combinations, which are solely based on the intrinsic properties of the different food products, they are based on the flavor compounds which are present in the products. This results in possible combinations that are innovative and are not influenced or restricted by cultural and traditional context of the products. This independence occasionally results in surprising and unusual combinations, for example: endives in a dessert, white chocolate and caviar, chocolate and cauliflower. Even as they are unusual, these combinations are quite tasty, because the combined food products have flavor components in common. The foodpairing methodology opens a whole new world of possible food combinations.
Secondly, foodpairing is able to provide a basis for the success of traditionally settled food combinations. It is not a coincidence that the vast majority of the traditional top hit combinations, like bacon and cheese, asparagus and butter have many flavor components in common.
History.
Experimenting with salty ingredients and chocolate, Heston Blumenthal, chef of The Fat Duck, discovered that caviar and white chocolate are a perfect match. To find out why, he contacted François Benzi of Firmenich, the largest privately owned flavor house in the world. By comparing the flavor analysis of both foods, they found that caviar and white chocolate had major flavor components in common. At that time they stated a hypothesis that different foods will combine well together when they share major flavor components, and foodpairing was born.
In 2009, The Flanders Taste foundation organized a gastronomic symposium, The Flemish Primitives, completely dedicated to foodpairing.
Methodology.
Foodpairing starts with an analysis of a food. The aroma compounds are determined with the aid of gas chromatography, which in most cases is coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The odorants are also quantified with other techniques. Key odorants can be identified by comparing the concentrations of the odorants with their respective flavor threshold. Key odorants are the compounds that a human will effectively smell. They are defined as every compound that is present in concentrations higher than their specific flavor threshold.
For example, coffee contains 700 different aroma compounds, but there are only a couple of aromas important for the smell of coffee because most of the aromas are present in concentrations that are not perceptible with the nose; they are present in concentrations lower than their flavor threshold.
The key odorants are essential to compose the flavor profile of the given product. The resultant flavor profile is screened against a database of other foods. Products which have flavor components in common with the original ingredient are retained. These products could be combined with the original ingredient. With this information, a foodpairing tree is built.
The essence of foodpairing is the practice of combining different foods that share the same major flavor components. Comparing the flavors of individual ingredients can result in new and unexpected combinations, such as strawberries paired with peas. This combination was adopted by Sang Hoon Degeimbre, chef of L’Air du temps in Belgium.

Wallace arrived at St Andrew's College at Sydney University in 1920 to study law and at the University rugby club he came under the influence of Hyram Marks, who had been senior to Wallace at Sydney Grammar and who was the club's first Wallaby representative. His potential was obvious and in 1921 he was selected in the New South Wales side picked to tour New Zealand. He played in five of the ten tour matches including the September 1921 fixture against a New Zealand XV which is now regarded as a Test match. 
With no Queensland Rugby Union administration or competition in place from 1919 to 1929, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of the fixtures of 1920s which were played against full international opposition were decreed by the Australian Rugby Union in 1986 as official Test matches.
In 1922 Wallace won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford where he won University "blues" in 1922, 1923, 1924 and 1925.
Scotland representative.
Whilst at Oxford, represented for Scotland in nine Tests between 1923 and 1926. He made his Scots national debut in a Five Nations fixture in January 1923 against France. He played against all of the Home Nations whilst representing for Scotland. making his last appearance in January 1926 at Stade Colombes also against France.
As a player he was at home anywhere in the three-quarters. He had a good turn of speed with a great outside break and was a magnificent finisher.
Australian representative.
On his return to Australia in 1926 he joined the Glebe-Balmain RUFC and in July of that year was selected for two Waratahs matches against the All Blacks.
Prior to the start of the Australian 1927 season an invitation from the International Rugby Board arrived in Sydney requesting a New South Wales side tour Great Britain to play Tests against the Home Nations. A squad of twenty-nine players was selected comprising twenty-eight New South Welshmen and one Queenslander in Tom Lawton, Snr who had come to Sydney to continue his career. Wallace was selected as captain for nine month 1927-28 Waratahs tour of Britain, France and Canada.
The selection of Wallace as captain is referred to in the Howell reference as "a masterstoke". He was well known in Britain through his Oxford and Scotland association, was an experienced and naturally gifted player, a strong tactician and a great influence on the younger players. On the nine month tour, the Australians won 24, lost 5 and drew 2 of the matches they played and returned having established an international reputation for playing fair and attacking rugby.
Howell quotes a speech given by Wallace at the tour's conclusion "Every man went into the game wholeheartedly and did his utmost. Australia should be especially proud of the team considering that the Waratahs were picked from nine clubs, while England has 40,000 players to draw from".
Post-playing.
After 1928 Wallace opted out of representative rugby but played at club level till 1930 and acted as a selector and coach for New South Wales and Australia for a number of years. He toured as assistant manager-coach with a number of Wallaby sides and coached a Waratah team to a surprise victory over the Springboks at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1937.
After the death of his father he returned home to Macksville to attend to family business affairs. Later he returned to Sydney and worked as a non-practising barrister with the Crown Solicitors office. He died at The Entrance, New South Wales in 1975.
Accolades.
In 2010 he was honoured in the sixth set of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame.

South African National Lottery

The South African National Lottery was established in 2000 and is the most popular form of gambling in South Africa by value and number of players. In the 2007 fiscal year transaction values totalled R3.972 billion, with an average of five million transactions per week.
Chronology.
After a marketing effort that aimed to reach 80 percent of South African homes directly
more than 800,000 tickets were sold in the first day of availability
Nearly R70 million worth of tickets were sold in the first three weeks of operation.
In October 2002 operator Uthingo suggested a daily lottery to supplement the weekly draw. The concept, called Keno, was rejected by the trade and industry ministry in March 2003.
In November 2003 the Lotto Plus game was launched, acting as a supplementary weekly lottery available on the purchase of a primary lottery ticket, with an entry fee of R1.
In July 2006 the Gidani consortium, featuring Greek company Intralot as a technical partner, was judged the preferred bidder to operate the lottery for seven years starting April 2007. The operating licence was awarded in October 2006.
In March 2007 the Pretoria High Court set aside that award on application by incumbent Uthingo, finding that the failure to adequately investigate the shareholders in some bidding consortia left room for conflicts of interest.
Following the final draw by incumbent Uthingo, the lottery was indefinitely suspended in April 2007.
In September the operating licence was awarded to Gidani again. 
When ticket sales re-opened in October more than 200,000 tickets were sold within the first three hours.
Lottery Gameplay.
The South African National Lottery main draw is called Lotto 6/49 and as the name implies you must choose 6 out of a 49 possible numbers, to win the jackpot you must match all 6 numbers to the 6 numbers drawn in the main draw. Tickets for the South African National Lottery cost R3.50 and in addition to choosing your own numbers there is also a quickpick option where the lottery terminal choose the numbers for you.
The Lottery also offers a Lotto Plus option where you can get a second chance to win for an additional cost. To play Lotto plus you need to mark off the Lotto plus option on your game card.
Socio-economic impact.
In June 2003 it was reported that 27 percent of lottery players were unemployed 
and that 43 percent of players earned less than R2,000 a month.
It was also reported that legalised gambling had created 50 673 jobs in 2000, although it may have redirected spendings from other industries.
2006 research found that 82 percent of South Africans played the lottery once a week and that 53 percent of the population did not engage in any other form of gambling. The average player spent R81 per month on the lottery.
Revenue distribution.
Under the current operator 34 percent of revenue is paid to a central charitable distribution fund, up from an initial 28 percent.
Six percent of revenue is paid as retail commission, ten percent is retained as operational costs and 50 percent is paid in prizes.
Previous lotteries in South Africa.
The now defunct homeland of Ciskei established a lottery in 1984 and operated by Score-A-Lot. In 1991 Sore-A-Lot was the first Lottery in Africa to operate Video Lottery Terminals (VLT) in Africa and the first totally cashless operation using smart card technology. After lengthy negotiations with South Africans “Department of Trade and Industry” (DTI) Score-A-Lot closed in Dec 2001
A lottery was established by decree in the former homeland of Transkei in 1989 and operated by Score-A-Lot. In 1991 Sore-A-Lot was the first Lottery in Africa to operate Video Lottery Terminals (VLT) in Africa and the first totally cashless operation using smart card technology. After lengthy negotiations with South Africans “Department of Trade and Industry” (DTI) Score-A-Lot closed in Dec 2001
The Natal Lotto (also referred to as the KZN Lotto) was launched in the KwaZulu-Natal province in 1992.
During eight years of operation it raised R869 million and paid R345 million to charities and R448 million in prize money.

Chris Fogarty

Andrew Christopher "Chris" Fogarty (28 January 1884 — 29 November 1915) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon and University in the Victorian Football League.
He was killed in a shell explosion in Gallipoli.
Family.
One of the ten children, six boys and four girls, of the wealthy wine merchant and former Mayor of Hotham (now known as "North Melbourne") Thomas Fogarty (1836–1900) and Cecilia Mary Fogarty (1854–1933), née Cullen, Chris Fogarty was born on 28 January 1884 in Hotham, Victoria. He married Mary Agnes O'Connor (sometime given as Agnes Mary O'Connor), in Hawthorn, on 7 May 1915, the day before he left Australia. and they had a daughter, Anne Christine Fogarty.
Education.
He was educated at St Patrick's College, Ballarat, Ormond College, and at the University of Melbourne where he first studied engineering and then transferred to a Veterinary Science degree.
Footballer.
Four of the six Fogarty brothers played VFL football: Thomas Bernard "Tom" Fogarty (1878–1922), played for St Kilda, South Melbourne, and University for a total of 95 games, John Joseph Fogarty (1882–1952), played a single game for South Melbourne, Andrew Christopher "Chris" Fogarty (1884–1915), played for Essendon and University for a total of 28 games, and Joseph Patrick "Joe" Fogarty (1887-1954), played with South Melbourne, Essendon, and University for a total of 16 games.
His nephew, Thomas Bernard Fogarty (1909-1984), son of his brother Tom, played 13 senior VFL games for St Kilda.
Along with his brother Joe, he played football, representing Ormond College, in a combined Melbourne University team, against a combined Adelaide University team, on 8 August 1906. 
Chris played his first senior match for Essendon, against Geelong, at the Corio Oval, on Saturday, 8 September 1906 (which Geelong won by 24 points), and his second march was in the Semi-Final on the following Saturday, against Fitzroy, where he played full-back in an Essendon team that lost by 36 points (his brother Joe also played for Essendon team in each of the matches).

World Development Report

The World Development Report (WDR) is an annual report published since 1978 by the World Bank. Each WDR provides in-depth analysis of a specific aspect of economic development. Past reports have considered such topics as agriculture, youth, equity, public services delivery, the role of the state, transition economies, labour, infrastructure, health, the environment, risk management, and poverty. The reports are the Bank's best-known contribution to thinking about development.
The World Development Report 2014.
"The World Development Report 2014 Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development" looked at risk management from a development perspective. It argued that managing risks such as job loss, crime, disease, disaster, social unrest, and financial and macroeconomic turbulence responsibly can save lives, avert damages, prevent development setbacks, and unleash opportunities. The report proposed a conceptual framework for thinking about risk and resilience, identified obstacles to better risk management, and recommended numerous avenues for better risk management that can be pursued by individuals, families, communities, enterprises, governments, and the international community."
The World Development Report 2011.
"The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development" looked at conflict as a challenge to economic development. It analyzed the nature, causes and development consequences of modern violence and highlight lessons learned from efforts to prevent or recover from violence.
The goal of this WDR was considered to promote new ways of preventing or addressing violent conflict. By drawing on insight and experiences from a host of past and present situations, the report identified promising national and regional initiatives as well as directions for change in international responses, and discuss how lessons can be applied in situations of vulnerability to violent conflict.
The World Development Report is published by the World Bank.
Previous reports 2008-2010.
The WDR 2010, on the theme "Development and Climate Change", explored how public policy can change to better help people cope with new or worsened risks, how land and water management must adapt to better protect a threatened natural environment while feeding an expanding and more prosperous population, and how energy systems will need to be transformed. The report was seen as a call for action, both for developing countries who are striving to ensure policies are adapted to the realities and dangers of a hotter planet, and for high-income countries who need to undertake ambitious mitigation while supporting developing countries’ efforts.
The WDR 2009 focused on the theme "Reshaping Economic Geography". Rising densities of human settlements, migration and transport to reduce distances to market, and specialization and trade facilitated by fewer international divisions are central to economic development. The transformations along these three dimensions—density, distance, and division—are most noticeable in North America, Western Europe, and Japan, but countries in Asia and Eastern Europe are changing in ways similar in scope and speed.
The report concludes that these spatial transformations are essential, and should be encouraged. The conclusion is not without controversy. Slum-dwellers now number a billion, but the rush to cities continues. Globalization is believed to benefit many, but not the billion people living in lagging areas of developing nations. High poverty and mortality persist among the world's "bottom billion", while others grow wealthier and live longer lives. Concern for these three billion often comes with the prescription that growth must be made spatially balanced. The WDR has a different message: economic growth is seldom balanced, and efforts to spread it out prematurely will jeopardize progress.
The WDR 2008 addressed "Agriculture for Development", calling for greater investment in agriculture in developing countries. The report warned that the sector must be placed at the center of the development agenda if the goals of halving extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 are to be realized.
While 75 percent of the world’s poor live in rural areas in developing countries, a mere 4 percent of official development assistance goes to agriculture. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a region heavily reliant on agriculture for overall growth, public spending for farming is also only 4 percent of total government spending and the sector is still taxed at relatively high levels. For the poorest people, GDP growth originating in agriculture is about four times more effective in raising incomes of extremely poor people than GDP growth originating outside the sector.
“A dynamic ‘agriculture for development’ agenda can benefit the estimated 900 million rural people in the Developing world who live on less than $1 a day, most of whom are engaged in agriculture,” said Robert B. Zoellick, World Bank Group President. “We need to give agriculture more prominence across the board. At the global level, countries must deliver on vital reforms such as cutting distorting subsidies and opening markets, while civil society groups, especially farmer organizations, need more say in setting the agricultural agenda.”
According to the report, agriculture can offer pathways out of poverty if efforts are made to increase productivity in the staple foods sector; connect smallholders to rapidly expanding high-value horticulture, poultry, aquaculture, as well as dairy markets; and generate jobs in the rural nonfarm economy.

Auguste Léopold Protet (1808 – 1862) was a French Navy admiral. He founded Dakar, fought in the Second Opium War, and was killed in the Taiping Rebellion at the Fengxian District of Shanghai on the afternoon of May 17, 1862. There is a temple in his memory.
He was born at Saint-Servan, France, and at sixteen he was admitted into the naval school of Angoulême. When he was 38 he received the commission of captain in the royal navy. At this time the English and French governments combined their efforts to put an end to the slave trade on the African coast, and Protet was employed in that service. After cruising three years on the coast of Africa he was appointed governor of Senegal, where he remained from 1850 to 1855. He served during the war with China, and was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral. He subsequently joined the expedition against the Taiping, who threatened an attack upon Shanghai, and he was killed during the engagement at Nan-Jao.
The French aviso (corvette) "Protet" (F742) was named after him and saw active service until the 1980s.

The 17th World Scout Jamboree was held August 8 to 16, 1991 and was hosted by South Korea at Soraksan National Park, near the border with North Korea, and some 200 km, six hours by road, from Seoul.
"Many Lands, One World" was the theme, which brought together approximately 20,000 Scouts from 135 countries and territories, and in particular, Eastern European nations, as all the formerly communist states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were developing Scouting in the months preceding the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Scouts from Czechoslovakia and Hungary participated as members of the World Scout Movement for the first time since 1947. Bulgaria, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and Yugoslavia each fielded contingents.
The Jamboree started with bad weather, with rain and flooding providing major problems. The opening and closing ceremonies were designed to rival those of the 1988 Summer Olympics. The Jamboree sported the first Global Development Village program, and was visited by Korean president Roh Tae-woo, Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco.
The British contingent transported a replica Brownsea Island Scout camp to re-enact Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell's 1907 experiment in Scouting. It became the most photographed and filmed event at the Jamboree.[http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/inter/jambo.htm]

Romanian New Wave

The Romanian New Wave () is a blanket term applied to a plethora of internationally acclaimed films made in Romania since the mid-aughts, starting with "Trafic", which won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.
Themes.
A great number of films that are part of the Romanian New Wave are set in the late 1980s, towards the end of Nicolae Ceaușescu's totalitarian regime, and explore themes of liberty and resilience under the communist dictatorship. However, films such as "The Death of Mr. Lăzărescu", "California Dreamin"' and "Tuesday, After Christmas" are set in modern-day Romania and delve into the ways the transition to free-market capitalism and democracy shaped Romanian society after 1989.
Aesthetically, films of the Romanian New Wave are united by an austere, realist and often minimalist style. Furthermore, black humour tends to feature prominently.

Coat of arms of Toledo (Spain)

The coat of arms of Toledo is almost the same for the City of Toledo and for the Province of Toledo.
Arms of the city of Toledo.
Toledo's arms are allegedly a grant of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (King Charles I of Spain). The coat of arms of the city of Toledo consists of the imperial double-headed eagle sable (black) bearing an escutcheon with the coats of arms of Castile and Leon quartered and Granada in point (a pomegranate as in the current Spanish Arms) surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, and crowned by the Imperial crown. The eagle is flanked by two figures of kings seated and bearing the attributes of their dignity: sword and sceptre.
An old privilege granted by the king, Peter of Castile in the "Cortes" (Parliament) celebrated in Valladolid in 1351 (1389 of the Spanish era), stated that the arms of Toledo are those of the monarch. During the reign of Charles I, the city definitely adopted the emperor's arms, and those are the present arms for the city, adding the figures of the kings, remembering ancient city symbols.
Arms of the province of Toledo.
The province of Toledo uses the same arms as the city but flanked by the pillars of Hercules, instead of the figures of kings.

Occupation of German Samoa

The Occupation of Samoa – the takeover and subsequent administration of the Pacific colony of German Samoa – started in August 1914 with landings by an expeditionary force from New Zealand called the "Samoa Expeditionary Force". This represented New Zealand's first military action in World War I.
On 7 August 1914 the British government indicated it would be a great and urgent Imperial service if New Zealand forces seized the German wireless station near Apia, one of several radio stations used by the German East Asia Squadron. Since the days of Richard Seddon (Prime Minister of New Zealand 1893–1906), Wellington had aspired to control Samoa, and in 1913 the Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, General Godley, had discussed the seizure of German Samoa with British military authorities.
A 1,370-man force sailed on 15 August 1914. The convoy stopped in Fiji to collect guides and interpreters and to rendezvous with the battlecruiser HMAS "Australia", the cruiser HMAS "Melbourne" and the French cruiser "Montcalm". The escorting "P" class cruisers "Philomel", "Pyramus" and "Psyche" were no match for Admiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron with the armoured cruisers SMS "Scharnhorst" and SMS "Gneisenau". Defence Minister James Allen recalled that the Reform Government had concerns about the German squadron, but McGibbon
denies any basis for the assertion in the 1923 history (and subsequently by Michael King) that the force narrowly escaped disaster, with the German cruisers being well to the north rather than only 15 miles (25 km) distant.
The New Zealand force landed at Apia on 29 August 1914. Although Germany refused to officially surrender the islands, the local German authorities offered no resistance and the occupation took place without any fighting. The first seizure of a German colony had taken place four days earlier at Togoland, captured as part of the West Africa Campaign, nullifying claims that German Samoa was the first enemy territory to fall to British imperial forces. The German cruisers "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" hastened to Samoa after Admiral von Spee learned of the occupation. He arrived off Apia on 14 September 1914, three days after the departure of the Dominion cruisers and transports. Von Spee learned that approximately 1,600 New Zealand volunteers were on Upolu, poorly trained and miserable in their woolen winter-weight uniforms, and that he could easily recapture the colony. However, he realised that a landing would only be of temporary advantage in an Allied-dominated sea, and instead sailed to Tahiti. He then rejoined the rest of his fleet and headed for South America.
After escorting the Samoa force, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force sailed to Port Moresby and met the Queensland contingent aboard the transport "Kanowna". The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, for the another takeover of a weakly-defended German colony.
The story that Francis Fisher (the New Zealand Minister of Marine from 1912 to 1915) recalled (as published by Downie Stewart in 1937) that the government asked London what defences there were in Samoa and was told by the British Colonial Secretary to consult "Whitaker's Almanac" was not supported by a search of papers in Archives New Zealand. The authorities in Melbourne advised that Samoa had a German-officered constabulary of about 80 men and a gunboat, which could have been augmented by seamen off merchant ships.
The force occupied German Samoa until 1920. New Zealand then governed the islands as the Western Samoa Trust Territory from 1920 until independence in 1962 – firstly as a League of Nations Class C Mandate and after 1945 as a United Nations Trust Territory.

Přítomnost

Přítomnost is a Czech quarterly political-cultural magazine published in Prague.
History.
"Přítomnost" was able to come into existence thanks to T. G. Masaryk (first Czechoslovakia's President), who at the time was financially supporting young journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
The magazine gained a notable reputation and became one of the most respected political publication of its time. A large number of democratically-minded authors such as Karel Čapek, Milena Jesenská, Eduard Bass, Karel Poláček, Richard Wiener, Václav Černý, Otokar Fischer contributed to Přítomnost. Politician and publisher Jaroslav Stránský was the magazine's publisher.
After the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Peroutka was deported to Concentration camp in Buchenwald. After the War, Přítomnost was renewed as Dnešek, but in February 1948 all came to an end. A number of young Czech intellectuals in exile tried to publish the magazine in its form incarnation and named it Skutečnost. Amongst the contributors to this magazine were Pavel Tigrid, Jaroslav Stránský, Meda Mládková and even Ferdinand Peroutka.
In January 1995 Martin Jan Stránský, the grandson of Jaroslav Stránský, carried on the family tradition and began to publish Nová Přítomnost. The first editor in chief of the renewed magazine was the poet Miroslav Holub. He was followed in this role by Petr Pithart, Jan Sokol, Tomáš Vrba, and Libuše Koubská. The current editors of the magazine are Ivan Malý and Martin Riegl. In January 2000, Nová Přítomnost went back to the original name of Přítomnost established by Peroutka. The magazine has published articles by some of the leading academics, writers, and journalists of the Czech Republic, including former Czech President Václav Havel. In 1996, Stransky also started publishing an English-language version of the magazine under the title of "The New Presence".

Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis

Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis (APMF) it is a poorly defined disorder that arises as either a clonal disorder, or following toxic exposure to the bone marrow.
Presentation.
Bone marrow biopsy shows abnormal megakaryocytes, macrocytic erythropoiesis, and defects in neutrophil production and fibrosis of the marrow (myelofibrosis). 
Clinically patients present with reduction in the count of all blood cells (pancytopenia), a very few blasts in the peripheral blood and no or little spleen enlargement (splenomegaly).
Cells are usually CD34 positive.
Prognosis and treatment.
Median survival is about 9 months.
Autologous stem cell transplantation has been used in treatment.
Terminology.
Controversy remains today whether this disorder is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes; however, it is currently classified as a form of AML.

The event was officially opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and her husband Prince Claus. The theme was "Future is Now" and the Jamboree was also visited by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Princess Basma bint Talal of Jordan and Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who inaugurated the second Global Development Village, a major attraction, with Scouts from all over the world sharing experiences and learning more about other ways of life. Various activities and stalls at the Plaza, in the middle of the Jamboree site, provided lighter entertainment.
Some of the range of activities were the Jamboree Friendship Award, the interreligious ceremony on violence and peace, a Scout Forum and connection via satellite with Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, with the participation of Scout associations, non-governmental organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations, in particular UNHCR and the United Nations Children's Fund.
The Comunidade do Escutismo Lusófono is based on the "Carta do Escutismo Lusófono" ("Charter of Lusophone Scouting"), formulated during the Jamboree on August 6, 1995. The original signatory organizations were the "Corpo Nacional de Escutas - Escutismo Católico Português", the "União dos Escoteiros do Brasil", the "Corpo Nacional de Escutas da Guiné-Bissau" and the "Associação de Escuteiros de São Tomé e Príncipe".

Parco della Preistoria di Rivolta d'Adda

Parco della Preistoria di Rivolta d'Adda (Rivolta d'Adda Prehistory Park) is an Italian naturalistic park of more 100 hectares of secular wood, situated in outskirts of the Rivolta d'Adda commune, Cremona province. The park is adjacent to the homonym Adda river and characterized by 30 reconstructions of prehistoric animals (inclusive prehistoric men), hundred semi-liberty wild animals, a botanical itinerary with plants signalled, natural environments (as: a swamp, lawns, lakes, etc.), picnic reggeds areas, cafe, playing parks, a labyrinth, shows fossils, etc., the all along a shaded course. 
The access to the park is exclusively pedestrian but is allowed the access by bicycles and dogs provided of leash too. The park is also recognized by various national and local corporate body that testify the validity of the structure as guide to the environmental education, not only for children but for adults too.
History of the park.
The first jobs of realization of the park go up again March 1976, which lasted two years. From the '76 to the '78, besides the jobs of realization, were iserite the prehistorical animal reconstructions, scientifically realizes with attention, in the end that seemed true animals. In fact, was possible to create these reconstructions beginning from the skeletons fossils recovered in various international sites, in which were well studied and analyzed the details, as the muscularities, the fleshy parts and the skins; in this way, was possible to realize some models in miniature, followed by reconstructions in fibreglass, every to natural greatness, just as these animals million of years ago appeared.
The other more meaningful amplifications have been:
Botany.
Park Flora.
Along the Adda left side, the park offer the possibility to know the vegetation of partial wooded formations, as the Northern Italy forests has been subject, for many centuries, to the various agricultural activities, reclamations and deforestations. In this line of the river is, in fact, possible to find the last hems of the primordial forest, characterized by deciduous leaves. The park wood entertains, also, intermixed kinds woody, as: poplars, elms, locust trees, etc. Even if the park suffers the infiltration of other wild kinds (how violets, primroses, hawthorns, etc.) and of the ancestral cultivations, its brushwood is nearly valuable.
Wood.
The park wood is a mixture of latileaves deciduous. The forest structure is divided in three layers: arboreal, shrubby, grassy. The arboreal is constituted from plants to tall stem (over the 15 m of middle height). The trees foliage of this layer give a seldom continuous coverage, giving the impression of an open forest. The shrubby layer is characterized by plants to varying height (from 1 to 7 m). The grassy layer is constituted by various kind, among which climbing kind too, how the ivy.
The swamp.
In the terminal part of the course, there is a swamp, consequential from the near herons lake (lago degli aironi). It is characterized by an ample curve, evolved in the time with the detachment from the quoted lake (meander). Here it is possible to admire the vegetation on the sides too, characterized from: willows and larches; the rest is aquatic vegetation, characterized from: water lilys, nasturtiums, etc.; in the muddy parts are noticed: cattails and marshy reeds. The rest of the vegetation, present in the center of the swamp, is constituted from: submerged plants, cried plants, semicried plants, reeds, etc.
Reconstructions.
In list are listed the 32 reconstructions of the kinds on the basis at the order of apparition along the course.

James B. Lockhart III

James B. Lockhart III assumed the position of Vice Chairman of WL Ross & Co. LLC in September 2009. WL Ross manages $9 billion of private equity investments, a hedge fund and a Mortgage Recovery Fund. It is a subsidiary of Invesco, a Fortune 500 investment management firm. As Vice Chairman, Lockhart coordinates WL Ross’ investments in financial services firms and mortgages.
For the prior 7 years, he served in the US Government in a series of Presidential-appointed, Senate-confirmed positions. He was the Director (CEO) and Chairman of the Oversight Board of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks. He assumed that position with the signing of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act on July 30, 2008. He was the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), which is now part of FHFA. He was nominated to that position by President George W. Bush, a friend of his from prep school, college and business school, and confirmed by the United States Senate in June 2006. 
He also served on the Financial Stability Oversight Board from its inception in 2008. This board was set up to oversee the Troubled Asset Relief Program., which is chaired by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and has as its other members the Secretaries of the Treasury and HUD, and the Chair of the SEC.
From 2002 to 2006, Lockhart served as The Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer of the Social Security Administration and as Secretary to the Social Security Board of Trustees. He was a member of President Bush’s Management Council and its Executive Committee. At SSA, he was the leader in promoting Social Security reform and in getting the Supplemental Security Income Program, the nation’s largest cash-based welfare program, removed from GAO’s High Risk list. SSA, OFHEO and FHFA all received the Association of Government Accountants’ prestigious Certificate in Excellence for Accountability Reporting.
Lockhart served in President George H.W. Bush’s Administration as Executive Director (CEO) of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) from 1989 until 1993. While he was at the PBGC, the agency restored the LTV Steel pension plans through a Supreme Court ruling and faced major airline (Eastern, PanAm, Continental and TWA) and steel company bankruptcies. PBGC also produced its first audited accounts in its history and was removed from GAO’s High Risk list under Lockhart's leadership. As a way to encourage better funding of pension plans, he began publishing the “Top 50” underfunded pension plan list. He also pushed for legislative reforms which led to the passage of legislation in 1993.
Government tenure.
Within three weeks of his appointment in May 2006, Lockhart published a report detailing the numerous missteps by Fannie Mae’s previous management and signed a consent agreement that restated Fannie Mae’s extra 30% capital requirement and capped the growth of its investment portfolios for the first time. In a joint press conference with the SEC Chairman, Chris Cox, Lockhart announced a $400 million fine. Shortly thereafter, he obtained Freddie Mac’s voluntary agreement to likewise cap the growth of their portfolio. 
From the beginning of his tenure as Director of OFHEO, Lockhart warned about the systemic risks Fannie and Freddie posed to the financial system and the need for Congress to grant OFHEO additional regulatory powers. In December 2006, Lockhart wrote an article stating that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s “government charters enable these companies to take on more risk than other major financial institutions. In addition to their significant operational difficulties, the Enterprises have lower capital requirements than banks, massive investment and derivative portfolios, limited discipline from credit markets, an inability to diversify their investments and no limit on bank investments in their securities…Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac present very large systemic risks to financial markets and financial institutions. That’s why it is vital that Congress pass legislation creating an empowered regulator now.” 
He testified in favor of stronger legislation several times and gave numerous speeches which were well chronicled. These efforts were strongly supported by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson. Reform legislation was passed by the House in May 2007 just as what was then considered only a “subprime crisis” was starting to appear. The Senate, however, did not pass the legislation, entitled the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) until July 2008. President Bush, who had called for GSE reform throughout his Presidency, signed HERA into law in an Oval Office ceremony on July 30. However, HERA was passed too late as stock market, foreign debt and mortgage-backed securities investors worried about their solvency. Lockhart had pushed both GSE’s to raise more capital for over a year and in March got their Boards to agree to raise significant equity. 
The new Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) combined OFHEO; the Federal Housing Board, which regulated the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks; and the HUD group that oversaw Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s mission and affordable housing goals. Mr. Lockhart became the first director of the new agency and Chairman of its Oversight Board, whose other members were the Secretaries of Treasury and HUD and the Chairman of the SEC.
By August 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were unable to raise additional equity while still purchasing over 70% of the mortgages originated in the US. Working closely with Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, Lockhart convinced the Boards of Directors of both GSEs to consent to being placed into conservatorship in meetings on Saturday, September 7, 2008. As part of this process, the CEO’s and Boards were replaced for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the two GSEs continued operations without interruption. With strong financial support provided by Treasury as authorized by HERA, the mortgage markets calmed temporarily only to be disrupted the following week by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Secretary Paulson’s book, "On The Brink", deals extensively with the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Lockhart's tenure spanned the financial crisis of 2007–2009. The New York Times reported that during his watch, "both Freddie and Fannie had plunged into the riskiest part of the market, gobbling up more than $400 billion in subprime and other alternative mortgages," criticizing Lockhart for lax oversight and not responding to early signs of trouble at those institutions. The FHFA office strenuously defended Lockhart's record in response, citing the fact that he had capped the growth of both Fannie and Freddie’s mortgage portfolio for the first time and had “repeatedly called for legislative reforms to increase capital requirements, reduce the size of the Enterprises’ portfolios and enhance regulatory authorities, including broadened authority to impose a conservatorship or receivership.”
Lockhart worked closely with the Bush Administration and many housing and financial groups to help stabilize the mortgage market, which was critical for the financial future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as they owned or guaranteed $5.5 trillion of mortgages (57% of all US mortgages). In November 2008, Lockhart announced the Streamlined Mortgage Modification Program designed to prevent the rapidly growing delinquencies turning into foreclosures. He pushed both GSE’s to be more creative and responsive in modifying mortgages.
He testified at a hearing on September 23, 2008 with Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke and SEC Chairman Cox on the need for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). He served as a member with them and HUD Secretary Preston and subsequently their successors as members of the Financial Stability Oversight Board overseeing the $700 billion TARP fund.
After the election of President Barack Obama, Lockhart remained in his post as Director of FHFA. He played a key role in the Obama Administration’s effort to stem home foreclosures, including the Making Home Affordable Program. 
Throughout the market turmoil, he continued to oversee the smooth transition to a new agency. OFHEO and FHFA both received the Association of Government Accountants award – Certificate for Excellence in Accountability Reporting as had Social Security. He worked closely with the 12 Federal Home Loan Bank Presidents as they dealt with their private label MBS problems. He strengthened their Office of Finance’s Board that produces their combined financial statements.
Career.
In 1997, Lockhart co-founded and served as managing director of NetRisk Inc., a risk management software and consulting firm since acquired by Fitch Risk Management. NetRisk's clients included major financial services companies.
He has served as Senior Vice President, Finance, at National Reinsurance(1996) which was acquired by General Reinsurance; Managing Director in Smith Barney's Investment Banking Group for financial institutions and Co-Head of its Private Equity Group (1993–1995); Vice President and Treasurer of Alexander & Alexander(1981–1989); and Assistant Treasurer of Gulf Oil in Europe and the U.S. (1974–1981). Lockhart served as a member of the American Benefits Council’s Board of Directors and on the Advisory Board to the Task Force for the Critical Review of the U.S. Actuarial Profession.
Early life.
Mr. Lockhart was born in White Plains, NY in 1946. He grew up in Riegel Ridge and Summit, NJ. He became an Eagle Scout at the early age of 13. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, MA for four years where he became a good friend of George W. Bush. During his senior year he moved to St. Paul, MN as his father moved to become CEO of Conwed from being the CFO of Riegel Paper Corporation.
Military.
He joined the Navy in 1969 after spending a year at the First National Bank of St. Paul. At Officer Candidate School, he was the Supply Corps Honor Graduate and at the Navy Supply Corps School he graduated with High Honors. He served as the Supply Officer on the Nuclear Ballistic Submarine USS George Washington Carver (SSBN-656) homeported in Holy Loch, Scotland. He qualified in Submarines and as an Officer of the Deck.
Education.
Lockhart graduated from Yale University in 1968 where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the lacrosse team. He received a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1974.
Personal life.
He married Carolyn Strahan Zoephel in 1972 (NYT, 6/18/72). They have two children.

Battle of Shanghai (1861)

The Battle of Shanghai (太平軍二攻上海) was a major engagement of the Taiping Rebellion that occurred from June 1861 to July 1862. British and French troops used modern artillery on a large scale for the first time in China. Cannon fire inflicted heavy casualties on the Taiping forces, whose commander Li Xiucheng was wounded in the left leg by a shot fired from a cannon.
Prelude.
Shanghai had been occupied by the initial wave of the Taiping Rebellion in 1851 but was recovered by the Qing in February 1853. 
In June 1860, a Taiping army of 20,000 led by Lai Wenguang had attacked Shanghai and reoccupied it for five months before withdrawing. In early 1861, Li Xiucheng was in control of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, commanding over 600,000 Taiping troops. He aimed to capture the large but isolated city, one of the most important cities under the Qing government and home to an international port. At Li Xiucheng's request the UK and France had promised to maintain neutrality.
By 11 June 1861, the Taiping Army was able to muster five armies, commanded by Tan Shaoguang, Li Rongfa, G Qingyun, Chen Kunshu, and Chen Binwen, organized under two fronts, and other units.
The commander of the Imperial Green Standard Army was Huang Esen, under the direction of Shanghai's taotai Wu Shu (道台吳煦). The Huai Army militia were led by Li Hongzhang.
First stage.
Taiping's Lieutenant General Li Rongfa began the battle with an invasion of Pudong by 20,000 men, transported in thousands of boats. On his occupation of the whole district, the city requested help from the English and French. In October (according to the Chinese calendar), the American Frederick Townsend Ward brought 2,000 Filipino and Chinese soldiers, whom he had trained, against the Taiping forces.
Following a fifteen-day Christmas ceasefire called by Li Rongfa, the government of Shanghai asked Beijing for assistance in December. In response the Huai Army with its 20,000 soldiers was sent to reinforce Shanghai immediately.
Middle stage.
On 10 April 1862 (according to the Chinese calendar), Li Hongzhang was formally promoted to governor of Jiangsu. Five days later, the Huai Army began their counterattack on Shanghai.
At the same time, the mayor of Jinshan District commanded 5,000 men of the Green Standard Army to surround and attack the city of Taicang, which was then occupied by Taiping forces. Li Xiucheng sent 100,000 men to relieve Taicang on 19 April. Despite orders from Li Hongzhang to withdraw, the mayor refused to do so, resulting in the loss of his entire force.
On 29 April, Major General Chen Binwen occupied Jiading (嘉定), whose Qing garrison withdrew to Shanghai proper. The Taiping Army then prepared to attack Songjiang and northwestern Shanghai from Jiading. Li Hongzhang ordered Major General Cheng Xuechi, vice-commander of the Huai Army, to counterattack against Chen Binwen.
On 1 May, Li Rongfa's force surrendered to the Huai Army in Nanhui District. Li Hongzhang delegated Brigadier Liu Mingchuan to accept their surrender, provoking Li Ronfar to order Lieutenant General G Qingyun to make a series of attacks against Liu Mingchuan in the district. The failure of these attacks forced Li Ronfar to withdraw from Pudong on 10 May, ending nine months of occupation. The Qing government thus regained control of eastern and southern Shanghai.
On 8 May, Cheng Xuechi launched an assault on the Taiping forces occupying Songjiang, and expelled them after thirteen days of combat.
Last stage.
In September 1862 a Taiping army of 80,000 soldiers under the command of Tan Shaoguang mounted a second attack on Shanghai, which was defended by Major General Guo Songlin (郭松林) of the Huai Army. The initial assault, led by Chen Binwen (陳炳文), faltered when Cheng Xuechi destroyed all twenty Taiping camps (one of which accommodated 500 soldiers); Chen Binwen retreated to Sijiangkou (四江口), where he joined Tan Shaoguang.
On 12 September, the consolidated Taiping forces, numbering 70,000, struck the Qing again from Taicang and Kunshan. Moving very rapidly, they reached Qingpu District, only 5 km from the city, and surrounded 20,000 imperial troops.
The Qing fleet commander Huang Esen counterattacked from the river, gaining some ground, but even after reinforcement by the Ever Victorious Army he was unable to make much progress. The Taiping forces used this time to build many floating bridges.
Li Hongzhang arrived to oversee the combat in person, ordering his generals (Cheng, Guo, and Liu) to defeat Tan and relieve the Imperial units surrounded by the Taiping on the northern coast before it was too late. On 21 September, Cheng Xuechi, commanding only 6,000 combined Huai Army and Qing naval forces, in eight successive attacks made between 8:00 and 14:00, was finally able to cut off the Taiping Army's retreat. The Huai Army were encouraged to break out of the enclave on the northern coast, destroying over 30,000 Taiping forces. Cheng himself received a serious gunshot wound to the chest, but was rewarded with a promotion to Lieutenant General.
General Tan, accompanied by Brigadier Gau Yonkwan (郜永寬), retreated to Suzhou to prepare its defences. The Taiping forces launched four more unsuccessful attacks against the defenders, after which Hong Xiuquan ordered the offensive to be halted and the forces to withdraw, thus ending the battle. The combined forces of the Qing government, the British, and the French were victorious, and Taiping permanently abandoned its designs on Shanghai.
Comment.
Hong Rengan was very opposed to this battle, Hong thought Shanghai was not a military problem.

SERCOS III

Sercos III is the third generation of the sercos interface, a globally standardized open digital interface for the communication between industrial controls, motion devices, and input/output devices (I/O). Sercos III merges the hard real-time aspects of the sercos interface with Ethernet. It is based upon and conforms to the Ethernet standard (IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3). Work began on sercos III in 2003, with vendors releasing first products supporting it in 2005. In addition to the standard sercos features cited under the sercos interface general description, sercos III also provides:
__TOC__
General architecture.
In order to achieve the throughput and jitter requirements required in the applications the interface is designed for, sercos III operates primarily in a Master/Slave arrangement exchanging cyclic data between nodes. The Master initiates all data transmission during a sercos real-time cycle. All data transmissions begin and end at the Master (circular).
Sercos III cycle.
Communication across a sercos III network occurs in strict cyclic intervals. A cycle time is chosen by the user for a given application, ranging from 31.25 µs to 65 ms. Within each cycle, data is exchanged between sercos III nodes using two types of telegrams: MDTs and ATs (see Telegram Types). After all MDTs and ATs are transmitted, sercos III nodes allow the remaining time in the cycle to be used as an UC (Unified Communication) Channel, which can be used to exchange data using other formats, such as IP.
The network remains available to UCC traffic until the next cycle begins, at which time the sercos III nodes close the nodes to UCC traffic again. This is an important distinction. SERCOS is purposely designed to provide open access at all ports for other protocols between cyclic real time messages. No tunneling is required. This provides the advantage that any SERCOS III node is available, whether sercos III is in cyclic mode or not, to use other protocols, such as TCP/IP, without any additional hardware to process tunneling. SERCOS nodes are specified to provide a store and forward method of buffering non-SERCOS messages should they be received at a node while cyclic communication is active.
Telegrams.
Telegram format.
All sercos III telegrams conform to the IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3 MAC (Media Access Control) frame format.
Telegram types.
Two main types of telegrams are used within the sercos III Cycle. The Master Data Telegram (MDT), and the Acknowledge telegram (AT). Both telegram types are issued by the Master (control). The MDT contains information provided by the Master to Slaves. It is filled by the Master, and read by Slaves. The AT is issued by the Master, but actually populated by each Slave with their appropriate response data (feedback values, input states, etc.). More than one Slave uses the same AT, filling in its pre-determined area in the AT telegram, updating checksums, and then passing the telegram to the next device. This method reduces the impact of the Ethernet frame overhead on the performance of the network without compromising IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3. The amount of data sent from the Master to Slaves, as well as the sum of the data returned by the Slaves, may exceed the 802.3-specified maximum 1500-byte data field size. To comply with this limit, sercos III may use more than one MDT telegram in a cycle, as well as more than one AT telegram (up to 4 in each case).
Synchronization.
To achieve true hard real time characteristics, sercos III, like sercos I & II, uses a form of synchronization that depends upon a synchronization “mark” issued by the Master control at exact equidistant time intervals. All nodes in a sercos Network use this telegram to synchronize all activities in the node. To account for variations in network components, delays are measured in the node-to-node transmissions during phase-up (initialization) of a sercos network, and those values compensated for during normal operation. Unlike sercos I & II, where a separate Master Sync Telegram, or MST is used for this purpose, sercos III includes the MST in the first MDT transmitted. No separate telegram is issued. The time between two MSTs is exactly equal to the designated sercos Cycle Time, tScyc.
Physical and data link layers.
Sercos III supports standard IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3 100Base-TX or 100Base-FX (100 Mbit/s baseband) Full Duplex physical layer (PHY) entities. 802.3-compliant Media-Access Controller (MAC) sub-layers are used. Autonegotiation must be enabled on each PHY, but only 100Mbit full duplex is supported. Auto (MAU Attachment Unit-Embedded) Crossover is specified between the two Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) units present with a duplex port. These two units are referred to as the Primary Channel and Secondary Channel in the sercos III specification. Dual interfaces are required (two duplex interfaces per device). Within the sercos III specification the dual interfaces are referred to as P1 and P2 (Ports 1 and 2).
Sercos III stack.
All of the functionality required to configure a Sercos III interface is contained in a stack that is available in both “hard” and “soft” versions. The hard version is widely used for embedded applications (such as drives, I/O modules and micro-controller based motion control), where:
The hardware stack is available in a number of different forms. These currently include:
The maximum jitter allowed with hard-stack-based Masters and Slaves is less than 1 µs. Using the above stacks yields a jitter similar to sercos II (35-70 nanoseconds).
Sercos III also supports a “Soft Master”, using a completely software-based stack for the master interface. Since the maximum jitter in such a configuration is dependent upon the operating system of the Master, the maximum jitter may be set by a variable for the sercos III network when a Soft Master is employed.
For basic Slaves, such as I/O devices, EasySlave-IO, a license-free bitstream variant of the EasySlave is available.
Data consistency.
A term usually associated with the IT enterprise, data consistency can also apply to real-time control (see for example Peer to Peer Communication). For this reason, sercos III specifies that no data be overwritten (destroyed) during a transmission. Every slave on a network may access input and output data for every other slave on the network.
Addressing.
Devices must support Ethernet’s MAC addressing, plus the sercos III addressing. Other addressing schemes are optional.
Network topologies.
The sercos III specification defines two possible network topologies; Ring and Line. To those familiar with other networks, they may appear to both be configured as a Ring. All telegrams begin and end at the Master. The Full Duplex feature of the physical layer is used to achieve this.
Infrastructure hardware.
Sercos III is designed in such a way that no additional network infrastructure (standard Ethernet switches, Hubs, etc.) is required to operate. In fact, no additional standard Ethernet (non-sercos III capable) components may be placed within a sercos III network, as their presence will adversely affect the timing and synchronization of the network.
Features.
Application layer (profiles).
The sercos III specification defines a broad range of variables developed by a consortium of product suppliers to provide interoperability between components (motion controls, drives, etc.). All Traffic across a sercos III network consists of Idents (parameters) with attributes. This method was first defined in sercos I, as an essentially flat set of Idents. They were later grouped into application sets to aid in selection of pertinent Idents required for a given industry, such as the “Pack Profile” for use with packaging machinery. During the development of the sercos III specification, this methodology was further refined to group the Idents logically by device class. The definition of the legacy Idents has remained largely untouched; rather their grouping has been re-evaluated for a more understandable architecture. This has also enabled the separation of communication Idents into a logical subset, simplifying migration from sercos I/II to sercos III, and providing a clear overview to users.
Redundancy.
When a ring network is employed, sercos III provides for automatic infrastructure redundancy. If any interconnection point in the ring ceases to function, the associated sercos III nodes will detect a “ring break” and “loop back” the end nodes, effectively operating as two lines rather than one ring.
The operation is “bump-less”, as the detection & recovery time to such a break is less than 25 µs, which is less than the minimum sercos III cycle time. Sercos III can also recover from ring breaks and “heal” with no interruption in operation. Since sercos III telegrams continue to be emitted by transmit PMAs on unconnected ports, and receive PMAs on unconnected ports continue to monitor for incoming data, when a sercos III port recognizes that a ring has by physically re-closed, it will re-activate the counter-rotating telegrams to functionally close the rings again. This operation is also bump-less.
Peer communications.
To ensure the determinism required, most Real-time Ethernet standards enforce a master-to-slave-only method of communications. This can conflict with the need for a node in the system to exchange data efficiently with a node other than the network master. The conventional method to achieve this in a master-slave network is to pass data from one slave node to the master, where it is reissued to one or more different slaves. For example, if several servo drives on a network are to be synchronized to a signal from another drive on the network, the master must fetch the signal from this drive and reissue it to all other drives on the network. Disadvantages to this method are that delays are induced due to the multiple cycles required, and the master’s processing load is increased as it must actively participate in the function, although it contributes nothing. Since no data is destroyed in a sercos III telegram, data to and from any slave can be accessed by another node on the network without any additional cycle delay or master intervention. Additionally, as telegrams pass each node twice in a cycle (for both topology types), a node can even have the opportunity to access data supplied by a subsequent node. Two peer communication methods are defined in the sercos III specification: Controller to Controller (C2C) for multiple masters to communicate with one another, and Cross Communication (CC) for multiple slaves.
Hot-plugging.
Another feature of sercos III is hot-plugging, which is the ability to add devices to an active network. Using the features described for redundancy, a network can detect when a new device is attached to an active network. Processes exist that configure the new device, and announce it’s availability to the Master control. After that, the Master control can select to make use of the new device based on the application currently running.
Unified Communication (UC) Channel.
The time between the end of the transmission of all sercos III Real Time (RT) cyclic telegrams, and the beginning of the next communication cycle is defined as the “sercos III Unified Communication Channel” (UC Channel). During this time period, the sercos Network is opened to allow transmission of Ethernet-compliant frames for other services and protocols. For example:
Every sercos III-compliant node must support the passing of UC frames through its sercos III interface. Whether a sercos III node actively makes use of the UC feature is determined by the feature set of the product. If, for example, the device has an embedded web server, it could make available its IP address for access by other devices.
A sercos III network will always pass UC frames, even when cyclic operation has not been initialized. This means that devices always have access to the network for UC messages, as long as the ports are powered.
Sercos III does not define whether a port should operate in cut-through switching or store-and-forward mode when handling UC frames. There are sercos III products currently on the market that support both modes. Likewise, sercos III does not define whether a port should intelligently process UC telegrams, such as learn the network topology.
The time allotted for UC traffic is dictated by the amount of data transmitted during the RT portion of the cycle. In real-world applications, there is a significant amount of bandwidth available for UC frames. For example, in a typical application with 8 axes of motion and a cycle rate of 250 microseconds, the equivalent of 85 Mbit/s is available for UC use. This amount of time means the UC frames in this example can be as long as the maximum defined for Ethernet (Maximum Transmission Unit =1500). Using the same example of 8 axes, but with a cycle time of 62.5 microseconds, the effective bandwidth available for UC frames would be 40 Mbit/s, and the MTU would be reduced to 325. As with any network where time on the bus is shared, MTU values should be configured to ensure reliable communication. Properly configured sercos networks will set the sercos parameter “Requested MTU” (S-0-1027.0.1) to the recommended MTU value, which can then be read by other devices to match their MTU settings. Regardless of the value of this parameter, a sercos node will allow non-sercos traffic to pass for the entire UC channel time period (i.e., telegrams longer than the MTU setting are not discarded by the sercos stack). Sercos parameter S-0-1027.0.1 is set by default to 576, the minimum value called out in RFC 791.
UCC access.
UC frames may only enter a sercos III network through a sercos III-compliant port. This can be achieved two different ways. One is to employ the unused sercos III port at the end of a sercos III network configured in line topology, as shown to the right.
In a network configured in ring topology, the ring can be temporarily broken at any point to also attach a device. Since the redundancy feature of sercos III will reconfigure the network in a bump-less manner (responding in less than one cycle), no disruption of network transmission will occur. The ring can again be closed after the access is no longer required.
If access is desired in the middle of a line topology (where no free ports are available), or it is undesirable to break a ring topology for extended periods of time, the sercos III specification permits a device called an “IP-Switch” that can be used to provide access to the UC channel anywhere along the network. IP-Switches supply two sercos III-compliant ports, and one or more ports for UCC access.
Commercially available UCC Switches block the transmission of sercos III broadcast telegrams out their non-sercos III port(s), to prevent flooding of non-sercos III networks with sercos III cyclic data.
Functional safety support.
"Functional safety" is a general term referring to the design of a system that reduces the risk that a hazardous event harmful to humans can occur with a system. The main definition is contained in the international standard IEC 61508. Most industrial networks contain some type of features to conform to functional safety requirements. Rather than define a unique specification for this functional safety, sercos III Safety is based upon the CIP Safety safety protocol developed by the Open DeviceNet Vendors Association (ODVA). This provides interoperability at the safety level with all networks based upon the Common Industry Protocol (CIP), including DeviceNet and EtherNet/IP.
CIP Safety on sercos provides for safe data transmission over sercos III up to SIL 3 (Safety Integrity Level). No additional safety bus is required, as the safety information is sent in addition to the standard data on the sercos network.
With CIP Safety on sercos, data is sent on the same medium using the same connections as standard communication. The function of the cross-media CIP Safety protocol is performed by the end units, making it possible to simultaneously operate standard and safety devices in the same network. Reliable communication can take place between all network levels, including peer-to-peer communication and cross-network communication. The master does not necessarily have to be a safety controller. It can also route data without being able to interpret it. This makes it possible for configure the safety network architecture for implementation of safety programmable controllers or peer-to-peer communication between sensors and actuators.
Sercos I/O Profile.
The sercos I/O profile is a device profile for decentralized I/O modules, which can be used for block and modular I/Os. It also supports hybrid devices that combine several functionalities in one single device, e.g., two-axis controller with I/O and master functionality.
An XML-based device and profile description language is specified for I/O device configuration. SDDML (Sercos Device Description Markup Language) describes which profiles are supported by a certain device. SPDML (Sercos Profile Description Markup Language) is used to specify the different profiles on the basis of the sercos parameter model. Existing standard parameters can be used and manufacturer-specific parameters can also be defined.
Sercos Energy Profile.
Sercos Energy is an application layer profile that defines parameters and commands for the reduction of energy consumption in a uniform vendor-independent manner.
Sercos Energy reduces energy consumption in three areas:
In operation, the control reads out parameters of each sercos Energy component via the sercos III network, receiving status information and detailed consumption values. Depending on the situation (e.g., scheduled or unscheduled breaks, machine components not needed in the current production process) standardized commands can be issued by the control to switch connected components (drives, I/O, sensors) into energy-saving conditions, up to complete shut-down, reducing their energy consumption.
The profile considers energy-saving conditions for predictable breaks such as lunch periods and plant holidays. At pre-defined times, sercos Energy components are brought into a standstill condition in order to save energy. Shortly before the end of the interruption, sercos Energy provides for the re-initialization of components in stand-by condition, to make them available again.
Sercos Energy provides mechanisms for unintended breaks caused by machine errors and missing parts. In these situations, target components can be carefully brought into energy-saving modes while errors are being fixed or during a wait for new parts.
By using intelligent controls, axes and components that are unneeded in ongoing production processes can be switched off and/or target completion times can be adjusted, while still achieving full productivity.
FDT profile.
Sercos III supports FDT (Field Device Tool) Technology, used by many manufacturers to standardize the communication interface between field devices and software engineering tools.
FDT (Field Device Tool) is primarily an interface definition, which is independent of the communication protocol. Special tools for the detailed analysis of devices are made available with a graphic user interface by standardized DTM (Device Type Manager) device drivers, which are integrated in a FDT application framework. The DTM device drivers enable the complete configuration and diagnosis of a device by graphic user dialogues. The DTM application offers a uniform user window for the launch, parameterization and diagnosis of field devices.
A joint working group consisting of the FDT Group and sercos standardization group defined extensions to FDT to allow the configuration of sercos III devices via an embedded DTM. SDDML compliant device description data can be converted to the corresponding sercos III DTM device via a generic conversion.
Additional resources.
Development tools.
A number of different manufacturers provide tools to aid in the design of sercos III compliant network nodes. Since sercos III uses standard Ethernet frames, most off-the-shelf network tools can be used on sercos III networks. For example, a driver is available for the free Wireshark network protocol analyzer.
EasySlave.
The sercos EasySlave is an FPGA-based single-chip controller, enabling inexpensive development of simple sercos III slave devices such as I/O. I/O applications are synchronized in the sercos cycle. An IP core is provided as a netlist for the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA family. The IP core contains all the functions of a sercos slave connection, including the associated software library for I/O devices (e.g., analog inputs, encoders). A reference design is available.
Open source driver library.
On April 21, 2009, sercos International and sercos North America announced a cooperation with the Open Source Automation Development Lab eG (OSADL) to provide an open source software driver library for sercos III. The library simplifies the development of a sercos Master node. All features of sercos III are supported, e.g., the real-time channel, the redundancy concept and hot-plugging. Two versions of the Open Source driver for sercos III boards are available: a driver for plug-in cards with a dedicated CPU (active boards) and a driver for plug-in cards without a CPU (passive boards). Released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the driver is available to download from either OSADL or SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cosema.
Sercos IP protocol driver library.
A driver library for the sercos/IP protocol is available as open source software. The driver software is available for download in C# source code at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cosema.
The protocol enables direct communication and uniform data exchange between devices without the need for a sercos master or a running sercos real-time communication.
The sercos/IP protocol can still be used in cyclic real time operation. In this case the sercos/IP telegrams are transferred into the sercos UC (Unified Communication) Channel.
Conformance testing.
Testing and certification of sercos products is performed in order to ensure that sercos products from various manufacturers are compatible and meet IEC standards. Once a product passes the conformance test, a certificate can be requested, and the product can carry the sercos trademark.
Sercos products are tested at the Institute for Control Engineering of Machine Tools and Manufacturing Units (ISW) at the University of Stuttgart. The aim of the conformance testing is to ensure the compatibility and interoperability of sercos devices from different vendors in multiple vendor environments. In the test laboratory, each device containing a sercos master or slave is checked for compliance with the sercos specification. The testing includes verifying the physical and the logical behavior of the test unit.
The sercos Conformizer test software is available for purchase by any sercos vendor who wishes to pre-test his products in his own facilities prior to submitting them for the official conformance test. This provides a 90% assurance of passing the formal test.
Further information.
Additional information on sercos III, including sources of sercos III compliant products and specifications for developing sercos III products, can be obtained from the governing organizations (sercos North America or sercos International e.V.).
A whitepaper on sercos Energy can be downloaded from the websites (see above). Sercos News is published twice a year, providing updates on sercos, applications articles and information on new products from sercos manufacturers. Copies can be downloaded from the websites. Webinars on the sercos technology can be found on www.sercos.com. Also, a planning and installation guide is available on request.

Fleetwood Pier

Fleetwood Pier, also known as the Victoria Pier, was a pleasure pier located in the English town of Fleetwood, Lancashire. At in length, it was one of the shortest piers in the country. It was built in 1910 at the end of the golden age of pier building, and other than a 1957 pier built in Deal, Kent to replace a structure damaged in World War II, it was the last pleasure pier to be built in the United Kingdom. The building was destroyed by fire and demolished in 2008.
History.
Fleetwood Pier opened on Whit Monday in 1910, and a pavilion was added the following year. The pier was badly damaged in 1952 after a fire which started in the cinema, and it did not reopen until 1958. At various times it has been an amusement complex, bar and dance hall. The Stefani family were the longest owners in the Pier's history, owning and running Fleetwood Pier from the 1960's until 2000. The pier was first closed in 2000 when its owners went into liquidation, but it was reopened under new ownership in 2003, after Roger Stefani sold it on. However, safety concerns forced the pier to shut once more, and when it was gutted by fire in September 2008 it had been closed for almost two years. At that time, the owners, Simmons Developments, had submitted plans to convert the structure into an apartment complex.
2008 fire.
The 2008 Fleetwood Pier fire began during the early hours of 9 September 2008 and resulted in the pier's destruction. The fire was reported to the emergency services at 4:30am after a member of the public saw smoke rising from one of the buildings, and firefighters from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service attended the scene. However, the pier was severely damaged. investigation was put in place to determine the cause of the blaze. On September 26, 2008, Wyre Borough Council, citing safety concerns, announced that the pier would be completely demolished, within two to three weeks. On October 10, 2008 the Council confirmed that the pier would not be rebuilt.

<doc id="19245333" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19245333" title="Monarchie und Alltag">
Monarchie und Alltag

Monarchie und Alltag (Monarchy and Daily Life) was the 1980 debut album of German rock band Fehlfarben, released on the Welt-rekord-label, a subsidiary of EMI. The album was not initially well-received, but developed a following over time, entering the charts seven months after its release and gradually climbing to peak at #37. The album belatedly spawned a hit single in 1982, "Ein Jahr (Es geht voran)", and certified gold in 2000, after a re-release during the post-punk revival.
The poor initial reception of the album and a scheduled lengthy tour prompted the departure of vocalist and songwriter Peter Hein, who did not return to the band until following a 2000 reunion. Guitarist Thomas Schwebel took over as lead vocalist for the tour and subsequent releases.
The album is regarded as highly influential in the Neue Deutsche Welle movement of Germany and the German punk scene. It secured a position for the band and its first lead singer as prominent figures in the German punk movement.
Response.
The album was not critically well received on its release, but in spite of line-up changes the band managed to increase public interest over time through live performance and the release of new material. Months after its October 1980 release, in May 1981, the album entered the German album charts where it gradually climbed to #37, only earning gold status in 2000 after a reissue coincident with the post-punk revival. Over time, however, the album has developed a tremendous reputation. "Die Zeit" described the album as a "revolutionary monument". Telepolis described it as "an unsurpassed masterpiece". It has been variously termed "a cornerstone of modern German rock", "the most important German punk album", and "the best German-language album overall". Bayerischer Rundfunk states that the group and the album were the "epicenter of the German punkscene in the early 1980s" and that with the release of "Monarchie und Alltag" the band became "the first volume in the German new wave".
At the time of release, the album did not secure any hit singles, but two years after the album was released label EMI issued "Ein Jahr (Es geht voran)" to capitalize on the rising popularity of the German new wave (Neue Deutsche Welle) movement. The song reached the top 20 in the charts.
According to "Der Tagesspiegel", the album has lost nothing of its appeal over the years, to those who were punk at the time or even those who were not yet born, as it retains its forcefulness, directness and relevance.
Background.
The band was formed from two former members of foundational German punk band Charley's Girls—Peter Hein and Markus Oehlen—who had gone on to play in the influential punk group Mittagspause. The pair decided to form a post-punk band with other prominent members of the Düsseldorf punk community: Thomas Schwebel, Michael Kemner, Frank Fenstermacher and Uwe Bauer. Influenced by the ska-punk music of London, they brought their interpretation of the style to live performances in Germany and to a 7" single released on their own independent label, Welt-Rekord-Label. In summer of 1980, the band's label was purchased by EMI, who gave them studio space to record "Monarchie und Alltag", which was released in October of that year. 
Although many of the band's members had a hand in composing material, much of the album was penned by vocalist Peter Hein during free time at his job at Xerox. "Der Spiegel" credits the best compositions of the album to Hein and guitarist Thomas Schwebel, who wrote the iconic song of the German "No-Future" generation, "Paul ist tot" ("Paul is dead"), one refrain of which translates, "What I want, I cannot get. And what I can get, I don't like." The album, at the cutting edge of musical styles, pushed Fehlfarben to the forefront of the German punk movement and made Peter Hein its point figure, even though he had quit the band three days before the lengthy "Monarchie und Alltag" tour to dedicate himself to his job at Xerox. 
In an interview years later with "die tageszeitung", Hein indicated that he found the then-security of his job preferable to the stressful life of a musician on the road and that returning to work felt almost like a vacation. It was a decision that puzzled the press at the time. Questioned about his work ethic in that interview, Hein stated that he was puzzled by the "arrogance" of those who looked down on the working class.
The band continued performing with Schwebel on vocals and releasing albums after Hein's departure, but reunited with its first vocalist in 2000 after the belated receipt of a gold record for the album

Louis Montoyer (1749, Mariemont, Austrian Netherlands, now Belgium – 5 June 1811, Vienna) was an 18th-century Belgian-Austrian architect, principally active in Brussels and Vienna.
Life.
He worked in Brussels as an architect and building contractor from 1778 onwards. Although he has been credited as the architect of the Royal Palace of Laeken (for Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen and his wife Archduchess Maria-Christina), later research made clear he was merely executing the designs of other architects such as Charles de Wailly. In 1795 he came to Vienna with Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen, who had already appointed him his court architect in 1780. There he first worked on rebuilding the duke's palace, now known as the Albertina. He also built the Ceremonial Hall at the Hofburg, connecting the Leopoldian part of the building with the old Imperial Palace. Also in Vienna, Montoyer built the Palais Rasumofsky for the former Russian ambassador Andrey Razumovsky.
On 25 September 1805 he was made an honorary citizen of Vienna, and in 1807 he was appointed court architect to Francis II. He was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery, where his memorial can still be seen.
