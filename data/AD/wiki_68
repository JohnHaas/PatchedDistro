Georgy Shishkin

Georgy Shishkin (; ; born January 25, 1948) is a Russian painter.
Biography.
Born in Ekaterinburg (then Sverdlovsk), Russia, son of a first violinist of the orchestra of the musical theatre, from the age of six, Shishkin began violin classes. As a child he showed an early passion for drawing, and by his tenth year he was enrolled a fine art school. During his youth, he was deeply influenced by the atmosphere at his great-grandparents’ house, steeped with authentic Russian traditions conserved during the Soviet regime.
Young Shishkin travelled to the many old cities in his country. With his easel, he visited monasteries and paid close attention to the icons and frescoes. In the Vladimir Cathedral, an ex-capital of Russia, he was struck by the works of Andrei Rublev, considered the first Russian painter.
He was a graduate of the Ural State Academy of Architecture and Arts in his home town, in 1975, then a trainee at the Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry. Georgy Shishkin was a professor of drawing and painting for about 10 years at this academy where he started as a trainee.
From 1974 he took part in professional art exhibitions, while remaining at home in Socialist Realism.
In the same year, he won the national competition for young creators in Russia and participated in the Prestige Exposition in Moscow.
Experimentation with different techniques led him to favour pastel from 1980 and three years later he created his base preparation under the pastel.
In 1981, during his first personal exhibition, many of his paintings were acquired by the State Fine Arts Museum.
However, being multi-faceted, Georgy Shishkin made the interior decorations for the Ekaterinburg Opera Museum (1983–1985), with two large frescoes and a portrait gallery of the most famous soloists. The portrait of the ballet star Piotr Gusev was acquired by the Saint Petersburg State Museum of Theatre and Music.
At the same time, for nine years, the artist worked as an architect and several buildings were erected according to his plans.
In 1992, after travelling abroad, in Germany and Holland, (from 1989), Georgy Shishkin, in a quest for his roots, began painting his “Russian Dreams” cycle of paintings. This cycle intended to express spiritual content by uniting abstraction and reality.
He was invited by the mayor of Saint Petersburq, Anatoly Sobchak, to show his works in the Russian State Museum.
As for the painting devoted to Chaliapin, it was presented to the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.
His arrival in France (1993) and in Monaco (1995) led to a meeting with “White Russians” and a new impulse for his cycle.
Lord Alistair McAlpine, after his visit to the Shishkin exhibition in Paris, wrote an article about him titled "Painter who captured the enigma of Russia" in "The European Magazine" (21–27 September 1995), noting the great mastery of the painter and high quality of his works.
In 1999, Shishkin won the Taylor Foundation Prize.
At Christie's, during an auction in the Principality, one of his paintings reached fourth place among works of famous artists like Arman, Botero, Folon or Matta ("Le Figaro", 20 March 1999).
Living in Monaco since 1998, the artist has participated in many humanitarian and charitable activities.
Georgy Shishkin’s works are found in museums and private collections in many countries, notably in the Prince Palace in Monaco, in the collection of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, in the collections of Luciano Pavarotti, Lord Alistair McAlpine, brothers Lords David and Frederick Barklay. The artist has made two series of paintings for the Royal Palace of H.M. Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi.
Invited to design Monaco’s postage stamps in 2005, Shishkin won the competition for drawing the effigy in profile of H.R.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco.
In month May, 2009 in Monaco two postage stamps « Centenary of Ballets Russians of Diaghilev » went out, created by Georgy Shishkin. He received a congratulation from Mr Geoffrey Marsh, Director of Department of Theatre of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

Orange–Fish River Tunnel

The Orange–Fish Tunnel is an irrigation tunnel in central South Africa.
Purpose.
For many years, large areas in the Eastern Cape experienced severe water shortages because of little rainfall in the arid Karoo. The situation was aggravated by the reduction in capacity of many of the existing dams due to heavy silt deposits.
The Orange-Fish Tunnel, together with its network of canals, weirs and balancing dams, has enabled these areas to be restored and has made the irrigation of thousands of hectares of additional land possible. The main purpose of the tunnel is to divert water from the Gariep Dam to the Eastern Cape for irrigation, household and industrial use. 
Route.
It diverts water from the Orange River to the Great Fish River and the semi-arid areas of Eastern Cape province.
The inlet tower at takes water from the Gariep Dam at Oviston: the name "Oviston" is an acronym based on the Afrikaans "Oranje-VISrivier TONnel". After traversing under the Suurberg mountain plateau, it releases the water to the Teebus Spruit (tunnel outlet at ), to the Groot Brak River and onwards to the valleys of the Great Fish River and the Sundays River.
Construction.
Construction started in 1966 and the tunnel opened in 1975. When completed, the tunnel's length of 83 km was the longest continuous enclosed aqueduct in the southern hemisphere and the second-longest water supply tunnel in the world. Over 200 000 m3 of concrete was used to line the tunnel which has a maximum throughput of 54 m3/s (about 2,000 cusecs).
The tunnel has a finished diameter of and ranges in depth of between and . It is on a gradient of 1:2000.
It was engineered in association with Messrs Keeve Steyn and Partners of Johannesburg for the South African Department of Water Affairs. Former Halcrow senior partner, Sir Alan Muir Wood, the "father of modern tunnelling" worked on many of the world's leading tunnel projects, including the Orange-Fish Tunnel.
Intake at Oviston.
The intake tower is situated on the south bank of the Gariep Reservoir at Oviston, approximately 19 km upstream of the dam wall. Seen from above, the intake tower is shaped like a four-leaf clover with each leaf containing an inlet gate - all at different levels. In this manner, water can be drawn from different levels to help control the water quality. Each of the four inlets can be sealed off to allow complete de-watering of the tunnel for routine maintenance.

The club then became one of the nation's top teams, with many players from LTC Prague on the Czechoslovak national team. The team won the Spengler Cup seven times, and twice they finished second. While the national team was preparing to depart for the 1950 World Championship they were inexplicably imprisoned, preventing them from defending their world title, and effectively putting an end to LTC Praha.

Charles Fox was twenty-one years of age and playing for the Glebe-Balmain Club in Sydney when he was selected in 1919 to play in an invitation Australian XV against an AIF side, a match which marked a re-kindling of interest in rugby union in Sydney following WWI.
In 1920 he appeared three times for the New South Wales Waratahs against the All Blacks scoring a try in his representative debut. With no Queensland Rugby Union competition in place at that time the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of Waratah matches of the 1920s played against full international opponents were in 1986 decreed by the Australian Rugby Union as Test matches.

Spook Spoofing

Spook Spoofing is a 1928 "Our Gang" short silent comedy film directed by Robert F. McGowan. It was the 70th "Our Gang" short that was released.
Synopsis.
The gang mercilessly taunt and bully their superstitious friend, Farina, who retaliates with a magic charm on one of the boys, played by Harry Spear. Harry plays like he’s dead, and the rest of the gang encourages Farina to bury the “corpse” before he comes back to haunt him.
Notes.
This is the longest "Our Gang" short, and the only silent "Our Gang" short that ran on three reels instead of two. It was for a while included in the "Little Rascals" TV package, but was later withdrawn for what has been perceived by some as racial insensitivity.
Bobby Dean was originally chosen as a replacement for Joe Cobb, once Joe outgrew his role. Dean died in 1929 due to health issues. He only appeared in four "Our Gang" shorts, this one, "Rainy Days", "Barnum & Ringling, Inc.", and "Fair and Muddy".
Jean Darling does not actually appear in this film, but is in at least one promotional photo for the film.

Oracle Warehouse Builder

Oracle Warehouse Builder (OWB) is an ETL tool produced by Oracle that offers a graphical environment to build, manage and maintain data integration processes in business intelligence systems.
Features.
The primary use for OWB is consolidation of heterogeneous data sources in data warehousing and data migration from legacy systems. Further it offers capabilities for relational, dimensional and metadata data modeling, data profiling, data cleansing and data auditing. Whereas the core functionality is part of the Oracle database since version 10gR2, some of the latter features are sold separately as options. OWB uses a variant of Tcl over Java and PL/SQL called OMB+.
History.
Oracle Warehouse Builder was built from the ground up in Oracle, it was first released in January 2000 (release 2.0.4). The 3i release significantly enhanced the ETL mapping designer, then 9i in 2003 introduced the mapping debugger, process flow editing, integrated match/merging and name/address cleansing, multi-table insert, scripting, RAC certification to name a few. The 10gR1 release was essentially a certification of the 10g database, and the 10gR2 release (code named Paris) was a huge release incorporating a wide spectrum of functionality from dimensional modelling to data profiling and quality. The OWB 11gR1 release was a move into the database release stack, and included the server components being installed with the database and MDM connectors.
The packaging as part of the Oracle Developer Suite ended in May 2006 with the release of OWB 10gR2 ("10g Release 2"), when the core functions were included in Oracle 10gR2 Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition.
With the introduction of Oracle 11g in July 2007 the OWB version was updated to 11gR1 ("11g Release 1").
Version 11.2 ("11g Release 2") was released with the 11gR2 Oracle Database in September 2009. Its features include support for Oracle OBI EE, and native access to an extensible set of non-Oracle platforms using customizable and user-definable code templates.
Future integration with Oracle Data Integrator.
, Oracle plans to integrate OWB with Oracle Data Integrator (ODI), an ETL tool Oracle acquired when it took over Sunopsis in 2006. In the short term, OWB and ODI will continue to be released independently, with each release being closer to integrating the two products. The Warehouse Builder 11.2 code template support is in fact derived from and largely compatible with the Oracle Data Integrator Knowledge Module framework. Oracle has publicly commented on plans to release a data integration product that will unify features from both of the current offerings.
UPDATE:
According to Oracle Data Integrator and Oracle Warehouse Builder Statement of Direction (First Published January 2010, 
Updated May 2011):
No major enhancements are planned for Oracle Warehouse Builder beyond the OWB
11.2 release. OWB 11.2 continues to be available and supported by Oracle, and patches
and bug fixes will continue to be offered at regular intervals. Oracle will continue to
support OWB 11.2 for the full lifetime of Database 11g and the full lifetime of the next
major database release (“Database 12”) in accordance with Oracle’s Lifetime Support
Policies for Database releases. Future database releases beyond Database 12 would
not be certified with OWB 11.2.

Mohanam

Mohanam (; மோஹனம்) is a rāga in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music).One of the first scales employed by the ancient Tamils was the Mullaippann(3BCE), a pentatonic scale composed of the notes sa ri ga pa da equivalent to C, D, E, G and A in the western notations. These fully harmonic scales, constitutes the raga Mohanam in the Carnatic music style.It is an "audava" rāga (or "owdava" rāga, meaning pentatonic scale). It is a "janya" rāga (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven "swaras" (musical notes).
The equivalent of "Mohanam" in Hindustani music is "Bhoop" (or "Bhopali").
It is one of the common pentatonic scales across the world and is very popular in East Asian and South-east Asian music, including China and Japan.
Structure and Lakshana.
"Mohanam" is a symmetric rāga that does not contain "madhyamam" or "nishādham". It is a symmetric pentatonic scale ("audava-audava" raga in Carnatic music classification - "audava" meaning 'of 5'). Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
"Mohanam" is considered a "janya" rāga of "Harikambhoji", the 28th "Melakarta" rāga, though it can be derived from other melakarta rāgas, "Kalyani", "Sankarabharanam" or "Vachaspati", by dropping both "madhyamam" and "nishādham". The Hindustani equivalent "Bhoop" is associated with "Kalyan thaat" (equivalent of "Kalyani").
Popular compositions.
"Mohanam" rāga lends itself for extensive elaboration and exploration and has many compositions in both classical music and film music. The "geetham" "Varavina mrithupani" is one of the first short songs taught to beginners in Carnatic music. "Ninnukori" composed by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar is a popular "Varnam" in this scale. Here are some popular "kritis" composed in "Mohanam".
Related rāgas.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāga.
"Graha bhedam".
"Mohanam's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 4 other major pentatonic rāgas, namely, "Hindolam", "Shuddha Saveri", "Udayaravichandrika" (also known as "Shuddha Dhanyasi") and "Madhyamavati". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāga. For more details and illustration of this concept refer "Graha bhedam on Mohanam".

A. E. Smith (violin maker)

Arthur Edward Smith MBE, known as A. E. Smith (188016 May 1978) was an English-born Australian violin and viola maker whose violins and violas are prized for their 'excellence of tone' and 'decorative elements' (e.g. sound holes, scrolls and curves). According to some musicians, "it is his violas that have the greatest reputation, being easily counted amongst the greatest ever created, regardless of era or nationality."
Birth and Early Years.
It is believed that Smith was born 1880, at Islington, London. He began his violin-making hobby in order to improve upon an inferior instrument which he had played in the Maldon Amateur Orchestral Society. Luthiering subsequently overtook engineering as his primary interest. Smith was self-taught, guided by A. E. Hill's book on Antonio Stradivari. His rapid acquisition of expertise attracted the attention of the Maldon antique and musical instrument dealer C. W. Jeffreys, whose firm he joined in 1905 as repairer and violin-maker.
Migration to Australia.
By 1909 Smith had made twenty violins and a quartet, with his instruments having already become noted for their excellent outline, arching and scrolls. He migrated to Melbourne, Australia in an attempt to set up on his own in an environment with fewer established competitors. In 1912-14 he worked with the Hungarian Carl Rothhammer at San Francisco, exhibiting a quartet of violins at the World Trade Fair, then moving to Sydney where he briefly continued his partnership with Rothhammer. 
In 1919 he established A. E. Smith & Co. Ltd, an importer and repairer - as well as a manufacturer, of stringed instruments. Smith personally trained his craftsmen in the production of violins, violas and cellos. His workshop established the careers of many other leading Australian violin makers such as Charles Clarke, Guy Aubrey Griffin, William Dolphin, Harry Vatiliotis and his own daughter, Kitty Smith. His presence as a luthier in Australia encouraged the development of local orchestras and violin teaching, as well as foreign virtuoso violinists through giving the confidence to accept Australian concert engagements and subject their precious instruments to long sea-voyages. During World War II when German strings were unavailable, Smith, trading under the trade name 'Paganini', designed and built machines to manufacture strings and fittings locally, rather than requiring import.
Smith luthiered at his Roseville workshop, producing between one and six violins a year, and on occasion viola and cello. His total output between 1899 and 1970 was about 250 instruments, with construction details of each being recorded in a series of notebooks. He was a traditionalist, using only well-matured woods such as European maples for the ribs, scrolls and backs of the instruments, and Swiss or Italian pine for the bellies. Smith's ultimate aim was to achieve the same structural perfection as seen in Guarneri and Stradivari violins. He took a musical approach to the science of acoustics. The varnish on each individual instrument was created specifically for each instrument being finished.
In 1938 his daughter, Ruth, married Ernest Llewellyn - a violinist, violist and conductor who later became the founding director of the Australian National University Canberra School of Music. Smith's wedding present to Llewellyn was a violin, which he used while concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra 1949-64; it then passed to a later concermaster, Dene Olding, who also used it in recordings of works such as the violin concertos of Ross Edwards, Samuel Barber, Frank Martin and Darius Milhaud. 
In 1947, Isaac Stern, whom was visiting Australia for the first time, attended a performance by the Queensland State String Quartet and was "struck by the tonal qualities of the violin being played by the leader", Ernest Llewellyn. He subsequently met with Llewellyn, and learned of A. E. Smith. The following morning they swapped instruments and played together. The two would remain friends until Llewellyn's death.
Reputation and Awards.
Smith's reputation for an even sound and tonal quality reminiscent of the Cremonese masters attracted the interest not only of leading Australian players but of the world's great violinists, violists and cellists; in addition to Isaac Stern, those who acquired and used A. E. Smith violins included Yehudi Menuhin (whose sister Hephzibah had played the Beethoven sonatas with Ernest Llewellyn), Tossy Spivakovsky, Ruggiero Ricci, David Oistrakh and Zlatko Baloković . 
In 1949, A. E. Smith was awarded diplomas of honour for both violin and viola at the International Exhibition of Violin Makers at The Hague and next year was the first Australian to be elected to the International Society of Violin and Bow Makers. He suffered a series of strokes from the late 1950s onwards and the workmanship on his later instruments fell away. In 1971 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services to music.
Death.
Smith died in Canberra on 16 May 1978 aged 98, predeceased by his wife Kate (née Dènèrèaz), formerly Davidson. He was survived by a pianist son, Arthur Denereaz, and his daughters Kitty Smith and Ruth Llewellyn. Kitty succeeded her father as violin maker and manager of A. E. Smith & Co. until its closure in 1972. A grandson Roderick Smith is also a violin maker.
Notable Instruments.
A quartet of A. E. Smith instruments is held by the National Museum of Australia, Canberra, and a violin at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. The cello of the quartet held by the National Museum of Australia can be heard played by cellist David Pereira on an audio file.

V. E. Christopher

V. E. Christopher was the Moderator / Bishop of India's largest Lutheran Church, the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church.
Early years.
Ernest Christopher was born into a pastoral family in Bhimavaram in Andhra Pradesh to Rev. Vardanapu Krupadas and Smt. Bhagyamma. His father, Rev. V. Krupadas was a pastor of the AELC. He had his schooling in Bhimavaram and collegiate education in Rajahmundry. Later, he pursued degree studies in Sri Y. N. College "(an NAAC-A grade college affiliated to the Andhra University)", Narsapur in West Godavari District.
Divinity.
Like his father, Christopher had an inclination to pursue the ultimate profession of priesthood. His Church society (the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church) readily sponsored him for his priestly studies. The AELC was then headed by Rev. Dr. S. W. Schmitthener.
Armed with a sponsorship letter from his Church society, Christopher enrolled for the graduate degree of Bachelor of Theology (B. Th.) offered by the ecumenical Andhra Christian Theological College "(affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College (University))", Hyderabad.
The then Principal of the College was the Cantabrigian Victor Premasagar. With disciplined faculty at ACTC, the young Christopher had a sound priestly formation. He was taught New Testament by Muriel Carder and K. David while Victor Premasagar and G. Babu Rao, taught him Old Testament, the core subjects in any seminary or theological faculty of a University. Christopher was known to be studious and disciplined.
Ordination & Pastorship.
After Christopher's ordination, his Church President, the India-born Rev. Dr. S. W. Schmitthener posted him to East Godavari District to minister in a rural parish. He also served in Lutheran parishes in Rajahmundry and Bhimavaram.
Higher Studies.
Christopher later enrolled for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity (B. D.) at his "alma mater", the Andhra Christian Theological College, Hyderabad and upgraded himself to earn a B. D. degree.
Synod of the AELC.
Rev. Christopher was twice elected as the Synod President of the West Godavari Synod, one of the six Synods of the AELC.
Presidentship.
In due course of time, Christopher was elected to the Vice-Presidency of the Church Society. Later on June 1, 2005, he was declared elected as the President of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church.

Glen Cinema Disaster

The Glen Cinema Disaster was caused by a smoking film canister in a cinema in Paisley, Scotland on 31 December 1929. The resulting panic and crush killed 69 children and injured 40; the final death toll was 71. It is considered one of Scotland's worst human disasters.
Events.
On the afternoon of 31 December 1929, during a children's matinee, a freshly shown film was put in its metal can, in the spool room, where it began to issue thick black smoke. Nitrocellulose film, as used at this time, can burn on its own without needing any supply of air. Soon the smoke filled the auditorium containing about one thousand children. Panic set in. Children ran downstairs so fast and in such numbers that they piled up behind the escape door which led to Dyers Wynd. The door could not be opened, as it was designed to open inwards and was padlocked. The following day, Paisley was stunned by the news that seventy children had died in the crush in the worst cinema disaster in British history.
An inquiry was held in Edinburgh on 29 April 1930 during which it was revealed that the cinema had been inspected and pronounced safe by the Paisley fire brigade on the morning of the fire. The owner, James Graham, had, however, agreed that there were insufficient exits, but claimed he had repeatedly reminded the manager, Charles Dorward, that the escape exits were not to be shut during matinee performances. The manager conceded that the exit gates had sometimes been locked to prevent children from entering the cinema without paying. A policeman who arrived on the scene just after the fire started reported that the gates were padlocked; however, another witness confirmed that she had seen Dorward unlock them. It remained unclear as to why the gates had been padlocked but there was a suggestion that it had been done by two boys. The conclusion of the inquiry was that the fire had been started by a short circuit when a metal box containing film stock had been placed on the top of a battery in the projection room. The tragedy had been made worse by the limited number of exits, insufficient attendants and overcrowding.
A relief fund for the injured children and bereaved parents raised £5,300: Paisley Town Council offered them a week's holiday at the seaside.
Impact.
Safety regulations were tightened in the wake of the disaster; many municipal authorities made inspections of cinemas compulsory. The Cinematograph Act 1909 was amended to ensure that cinemas had more exits, that doors opened outwards and that they were fitted with push bars. A limitation was also placed on the seating capacity of cinemas.
Artefacts.
A small display is at Paisley Museum which has some articles on the disaster, a receipt for a funeral, a pair of shoes, and a hat. There are also letters sent to the Provost of Paisley from other civic leaders, both in the UK, Europe and from the USA. Some of the more poignant letters are from women who were unable to keep their own children, offering them to the devastated families of Paisley.
In 2005, a team of archaeologists rediscovered the cinema buried behind the walls of a furniture shop in Paisley's town centre.

Licerio Topacio

General Licerio Topacio (1839–1925) was a leader in the Philippine Independence movement.
Born in Imus, Cavite, on August 27, 1839 to Miguel Topacio, a former gobernadorcillo, and Marta Cuenco, the young Licerio finished his studies in Imus. He was not able to pursue higher education in Manila. But he kept on developing his inborn talent by self-study, and when the Revolution broke out he showed exceptional leadership in battle.
Because of the on-going Lachambre offensive in Magdalo territory, only eight Magdalo leaders were able to attend the Tejeros Convention on March 22, 1897. They were Baldomero Aguinaldo, Daniel Tria Tirona, Felix Cuenca, Cayetano Topacio, Crispulo Aguinaldo, Antonio Montenegro, and an unidentified Magdalo leader. Except for Montenegro and this unidentified leader they were all members of the Magdalo Council or Government. Licerio Topacio was the eldest of the Magdalo leaders present. In deference to his age he must have been considered by the group for nomination as president of the Revolutionary Government to be established. But he declined because he was too old (58) and that the presidency needed a younger, stronger man. The next choice was Emilio Aguinaldo, who was absent, defending the strategic Pasong Santol in Dasmariñas against repeated assaults by Lachambre’s troops. Aguinaldo was elected president of the Revolutionary Government in absentia.
After the Battle of Imus (September 3, 1896) and the Battle of Binakayan (November 9–11), Aguinaldo’s prestige as a military leader had risen like a meteor, making him a living legend. It was this image as a living legend, more than anything else that won for Aguinaldo the majority votes in the Magdiwang dominated Tejeros Convention.
Had Licerio Topacio, instead of Aguinaldo, been nominated in the Tejeros Convention, the chances were that he might have been decisely beaten by a younger and more famous man, Andres Bonifacio, the Katipunan Supremo. Of course, with such an outcome “history would have been taken a different course,’ as claimed by biographer Gwekoh.
There are alternative views about the reasons he did ot become head of the movement. One biographer, Sol H. Gwekoh, says that had Topacio not gallantly given way to a young man, Emilio Aguinaldo, he would have been the leader of the Philippine Revolutionary. Another biographer, Benjamin M. Bolivar, claims that Topacio “declined the honor” when Aguinaldo offered him the leadership of the Revolution.
After the Philippine-American War Topacio was twice appointed as municipal president of Imus. He died on April 19, 1925 at the age of 86.

Mohammad Usman Rana

Mohammad Usman Rana (born 3 June 1985) is a Norwegian Pakistani commentator, columnist and medical doctor, achieving his degree at the University of Oslo. 
Early life.
He was born in Norway, and grew up in Husvik in southern Tønsberg. His father Aftab Ahmed Rana was a local politician for the Norwegian Labour Party, and a leader of an Islamic congregation(named "Islamsk Senter") in Vestfold.
Career.
Rana enrolled at the University of Oslo to attend medical school. In 2005 he became the leader of the Norwegian-Pakistani Students' Association ("Norsk-pakistansk studentersamfunn"). In 2007 Rana became the leader of the Muslim Students' Association at the University of Oslo. He is a columnist in the largest newspaper in Norway, Aftenposten - and is used as a commentator on Islam, extremism and secularism. 
He helped organize humanitarian aid to the victims of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. He participated in debates on national television and was interviewed by newspapers on issues pertaining to immigration, integration, Islamism, internal strife in Norwegian Muslim groups. 
Norwegian Islam.
Rana emphasizes the importance of contextualization of Islam in Scandinavia and creating a Norwegian-Muslim identity, which is truthful to the Islamic texts and also to the Scandinavian context. Rana has written extensively on these topics. He is currently writing a book which is titled "The idea of Norwegian Islam". He recommends that future Norwegian imams must be trained at institutions in the West, he said in an interview with the Norwegian MorgenBladet: "It is tempting to believe that imams who are educated in the West will have greater understanding of what it means to be a Muslim in Western societies." 
Essay contest victory.
In early 2008, Rana won an essay contest initiated by the newspaper "Aftenposten". The idea of the contest is to broadcast voices of young people in Norway. In his winning text, titled "The Secular Extremism" (), Rana argued that religious debaters were driven away from the Norwegian public sphere, due to a perceived degradation of views based on religion. He used the case of then-bishop-elect of Oslo Ole Christian Kvarme as an example, claiming that Kvarme was exposed to the "pillory of modern society" when commentators largely denounced his Conservative Christian views. Rana warned against a perceived intolerance of religious practice, citing France and Turkey as bad examples due to the Islamic dress controversy in those countries and portrayed the USA as the remarkable illustration of a moderate secular nation which allows and includes religious expressions.
Muhammad cartoons.
Regarding the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, Norwegian flags were burned in the Middle East. Rana said that "the burning of the Norwegian flag, all because a small number of Christian extremists published pictures of the Prophet, is unfair", according "Verdens Gang". He was accused by Hege Storhaug, of "exploiting" the situation to promote illiberal attitudes towards perceived blasphemous expressions. The day before Rana had described Storhaug as "extremely xenophobic", "paranoid", adherent of racism and an "extremist" who "hates Islam", in "Verdens Gang". He then countered that Storhaug's allegations were untrue.
When one of the cartoons were reprinted in a Norwegian magazine in September 2008, Rana described it as "vulgar", "unnecessary and desperate". "Criticism of Islam is important, but there are other and better ways to do it", Rana commented.

Club Atlético Corrales

Club Atlético Corrales, usually known simply as Atlético Corrales was a football (soccer) club based in Asunción, Paraguay. It was founded in 1919 and dissolved in 1949.
History.
The club was founded in 1919 by employees of the "Compañia Americana de Luz y Tracción" ("American Company of Light and Traction") which was a private company in charge of the power/electricity distribution and tramway services in Paraguay. The club was soon financed by the company and started participating in the lower divisions of the Paraguayan league. The team got promoted to the 1st division in 1929 after winning the Intermedia (second division) tournament and remained in the top-flight until 1941.
The team played under the name of C.A.L.T. (the initials of the company) but later on changed its name to "Atlético Corrales" in 1935 since the Paraguayan FA decided to prohibit the use of a company name for a club. In 1949, the government opted to nationalize the electricity services and thus the private company C.A.L.T. came to an end and so did Atlético Corrales.
Its stadium, which was considered among the most modern at the time in Paraguay, was bought by the Paraguayan Army and today is known as the "Escuela de Educación Fisica de las Fuerzas Armadas" ("Physical Education School of the Army").
The Latin American tour.
In 1939, Atlético Corrales was given permission by the Paraguayan FA to miss that year's tournament and embark on a Latin American tour that remains until this date the longest by any Paraguayan team. The tour lasted 1 year and 15 days (from 4 April 1939 to 19 April 1940), and the club traveled to participate in exhibition games in Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Colombia, Dutch Antilles, Surinam, Venezuela and Ecuador. Atlético Corrales was well prepared for the tour after having a good performance in the 1938 Paraguayan 1st division tournament, and on top of the good squad they had before the trip they added and signed a few players along their visit to other countries such as Lino Taioli and Alejandro Mariscotti (from Argentina), Luis de la Fuente (Mexico) and Ceballos (Ecuador). The signings were made possible thanks to the wealth of the board directors from the club and the C.A.L.T. company. The tour was a success, with the team winning several friendly tournaments and games, and also selling some players along the way.

<doc id="19315308" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19315308" title="Dominance versus overdominance">
Dominance versus overdominance

Dominance versus overdominance is a scientific controversy in the field of genetics that has persisted for more than a century. These two alternative hypotheses were first stated in 1908.
Genetic basis of heterosis.
When a population is small or inbred, it tends to lose genetic diversity. Inbreeding depression is the loss of fitness due to loss of genetic diversity. Inbred strains tend to be homozygous for recessive alleles that are mildly harmful (or produce a trait that is undesirable from the standpoint of the breeder). Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness.
Selective breeding of plants and animals, including hybridization, began long before there was an understanding of underlying scientific principles. In the early 20th century, after Mendel's laws came to be understood and accepted, geneticists undertook to explain the superior vigor of many plant hybrids. Two competing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, were developed:
Dominance and overdominance have different consequences for the gene expression profile of the individuals. If over-dominance is the main cause for the fitness advantages of heterosis, then there should be an over-expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring compared to the homozygous parents. On the other hand, if dominance is the cause, fewer genes should be under-expressed in the heterozygous offspring compared to the parents. Furthermore, for any given gene, the expression should be comparable to the one observed in the fitter of the two parents.
Historical retrospective.
Population geneticist James Crow, who in his younger days believed that overdominance was a major contributor to hybrid vigor undertook a retrospective review of the developing science. According to Crow, the demonstration of several cases of heterozygote advantage in Drosophila and other organisms first caused great enthusiasm for the overdominance theory among scientists studying plant hybridization. But overdominance implies that yields on an inbred strain should decrease as inbred strains are selected for the performance of their hybrid crosses, as the proportion of harmful recessives in the inbred population rises. Over the years, experimentation in plant genetics has proven that the reverse occurs, that yields increase in both the inbred strains and the hybrids, suggesting that dominance alone may be adequate to explain the superior yield of hybrids. Only a few conclusive cases of overdominance have been reported in all of genetics. Since the 1980s, as experimental evidence has mounted, the dominance theory has made a comeback. 
Crow writes, "The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and the high yield of hybrids. There is little statistical evidence for contributions from overdominance and epistasis. But whether the best hybrids are getting an extra boost from overdominance or favorable epistatic contributions remains an open question."

Sandbag is a Community Interest Company, campaigning to increase public awareness of emissions trading. The organisation was announced in 2008 by Bryony Worthington and was the first (and founding) member of "The Guardian's" Environment Network.
The Sandbag website centres on the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme and allows its members to campaign to reduce the number of permits in circulation and to purchase permits and cancel them. Large corporations (such as vehicle manufacturers) must obtain these permits from the EU if they need to emit greenhouse gases during production. The purchase of these permits by the public prevents their use by corporations. Worthington described her organisation as "a bit like burning money in front of someone so they can't spend it on something bad."
Worthington gave the first public talk on Sandbag (as well as emissions trading in general) at a geeKyoto meeting in London during May 2008.

USS Las Vegas Victory (AK-229)

USS "Las Vegas Victory" (AK-229) was a "Boulder Victory"-class cargo ship acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. She served in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations through the end of the war earning one battle star, and then returned to the United States for disposal.
Victory built in California.
"Las Vegas Victory", a cargo ship, was launched 1944 by Permanente Metals Corporation, Richmond, California; sponsored by Mrs. E. W. Cragin; acquired by the Navy 25 October 1944 and commissioned the same day, Lt. Comdr. William P. Lally in command.
World War II operations.
After shakedown along the U.S. West Coast. "Las Vegas Victory" departed Astoria, Oregon, 26 November for the Pacific islands. Sailing via Eniwetok and Ulithi, the cargo ship arrived Kossol Passage, Palau Islands, 31 December, laden with 7,600 tons of vital ammunition.
From January to March 1945, "Las Vegas Victory" shuttled ammunition among the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands, and replenished the fighting ships as they moved closer to the Japanese homeland. Departing Ulithi 25 March, she sailed for the rendezvous with units heading for Okinawa. Making her way through submarine infested waters, the cargo ship arrived off Okinawa on the 31st, and replenished two escort carriers with ammunition.
On 1 April the invasion of Okinawa started the removal of the last barrier “on the road to Japan.” Under constant attack by Japanese suicide pilots, "Las Vegas Victory" passed ammunition to battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and LCT’s until late May. Arriving San Pedro, Leyte, 10 June, she loaded more ammunition and sailed for Eniwetok 19 July.
Upon her arrival 1 week later, she was assigned to the Pacific Service Force. "Las Vegas Victory" supported American forces in the Pacific Ocean until 7 November when she departed Eniwetok for the United States. 
Post-war decommissioning.

Edward Waddington

Edward Waddington (1670?–1731) was an English prelate, bishop of Chichester from 1724 to 1731.
Biography.
Waddington was born in London in 1670 or 1671. He was educated at Eton College, and was admitted a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, on 30 June 1687, graduating B.A. in 1691 and M.A. in 1695, and proceeding D.D. in 1710. He was elected a fellow of King's College, and was made chaplain to the Bishop of Lincoln. In 1698, his grandfather dying and leaving him an estate of £500 a year, he resigned his fellowship, at the same time, presenting the college with twelve folio volumes, entitled 'Thesaurus Antiquitatum Romanorum,' collected by Grævius.
On 1 October 1702 he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Wexham, near Eton in Buckinghamshire. He was instituted rector of All Hallows the Great in Thames Street on 12 September 1712, was appointed chaplain in ordinary to George I in 1716, and was elected a fellow of Eton College on 9 November 1720. On the death of John Adams on 29 January 1719-20, he presented himself for election as provost of King's College, but was defeated by Andrew Snape. On 11 October 1724 he was consecrated bishop of Chichester in succession to Thomas Bowers. He found the Episcopal palace in a ruinous condition, and refitted it at his own charge. In 1730 he entered into a controversy with Nathaniel Lardner on the prosecution of Thomas Woolston for writing against the reality of Christ's miracles. Lardner's plea for freedom of statement did not meet with Waddington's approval, and several letters on the subject passed between them.
Family life.
Waddington died without issue at Chichester on 8 September 1731, and was buried in the cathedral. He was a liberal benefactor to Eton College, to which he left his library. He was married, on 20 June 1699, to Frances, daughter of Jonathon Newey of Worcestershire. She died on 5 September 1728. Most of Waddington's wealth descended to his nieces, one of whom, Elizabeth Price, in 1731 made a runaway match with Isaac Maddox at one time his chaplain, and afterwards bishop of Worcester.
Waddington was the author of several published sermons. His portrait was painted by Hamlet Winstanley, and was engraved by John Faber the younger (reproduced above).

Speedway in Sweden

Speedway in Sweden consists of three domestic leagues, a Speedway Grand Prix and an annual entry into the Speedway World Cup. Sweden has produced five World Champions and the Sweden national speedway team have been World Cup winners on ten occasions. Speedway is one of the most popular motorsports in the country.
History.
The Swedish speedway league was founded in 1948 and was inspired by British speedway including adopting British teams nicknames in Swedish versions. As popularity of the sport grew many new clubs were founded all around Sweden and during the 1950s and over 30 different clubs have competed in at least one season in the league system.
League competitions.
There are three leagues in Sweden:
Speedway meetings in Sweden are normally held between May and September. Swedish teams are generally known by nicknames rather than club or city names. These nicknames usually have some sort of local connection.
The Elite League was established in 1982 and has ten teams with meetings usually held on Tuesday evenings. At the end of each season the top four teams ride in the play-offs in semi-finals and a final and the winner of the final are the Elite League champions. The team finishing bottom are relegated to the National league.
The National league has seven teams and before the introduction of the Elite league in 1982 was the top flight speedway league in Sweden. Meetings are held usually on Thursday evenings. As with the National league, the top four teams at the end of each season compete in the play-offs in semi-finals and a final. The winner of the final are the National League champions and are promoted to the National league.
Division One is the third tier of Swedish speedway with seven teams. Meetings are usually held on Thursdays. The team finishing the season in first place can apply for promotion to the National league, which is subject to having suitable facilities and sufficient finances. No teams are relegated as membership of the league is by application.
Other competitions.
The Swedish Individual Championship is for Swedish riders only. The riders are usually selected on the basis of their averages, with four riders being seeded directly to the final round. Another 36 riders are drawn into two semi-final rounds, with the four lowest ranked riders in each competing in the pre-meeting runoffs. The top nine riders in each semi-final progress to the final which is run using a modified Grand Prix format with 20 heats. The winner of the final is awarded a gold medal and becomes the Swedish Individual Champion. Riders finishing second and third are awarded silver and bronze medals.
The Swedish Junior Individual Championship is for Swedish riders aged 21 years and under. Thirty six riders are drawn into two semi-final arounds with the four lowest-ranked riders in each competing in the pre-meeting runoffs. The top seven riders in each semi-final progress to the final round, with the next two riders qualifying for the pre-meeting runoff. The winner of the final is awarded a gold medal and becomes Swedish Junior Individual Champion. Riders finishing second and third are awarded silver and bronze medals respectively.

He would face the South Africans twelve days later as part of the Swansea team that achieved a tight victory over the tourists. His second and final cap was during the 1913 Five Nations Championship when he was selected to face England. The Welsh team lost badly and Hollingdale was one of eight players from the side that would not represent Wales again.

African National Party

African National Party (, PNA) was a political party in Chad. PNA was founded on January 30, 1960, through the merger remnants of four parties based in the Muslim-dominated northern Chad; African Socialist Movement, Chadian Social Action, Independent Democratic Union of Chad and Grouping of Rural and Independent Chadians. Initially, PNA held 25 seats in the National Assembly, but the party suffered from defections to the Chadian Progressive Party, first the number of MPs went down to 17 and then to ten. In April 1961 PNA merged with the Chadian Progressive Party at a Unity Congress in Abéché, forming the Union for the Progress of Chad (UPT). 
This alliance did however become short-lived, as PNA issued their own candidate lists for elections. In 1961 PNA leaders were arrested, in January 1962 the party was banned. In 1963, the PNA leader Djbrinne Kherallah declared that the PNA would not agree to dissolve itself.

Alfred Schuler

Alfred Schuler (* 22 November 1865 in Mainz; † 8 April 1923 in Munich) was a religious founder, a gnostic, a mystic and a visionary. Franz Wegener has called Schuler the last of the German Cathars. Schuler saw himself as a reborn Roman of the late imperial era. Also a neopagan, he was the spiritual focus of the "Munich Cosmic Circle", and made a broad impact without ever publishing a book during his lifetime. Stefan George and Ludwig Klages were, amongst others, significantly influenced by him. 
Schuler studied Archaeology (and Law) in Munich but came to see archaeologists as ""desecrators of graves ripping out of the earth what has been sanctified by the rite of burial, and confining to the unwholesome air of museums the lustrous force rightly working its mighty influence under the cover of darkness"". After his studies Schuler made his living as an 'independent scholar' in Munich. He held his own "rebirth into an unpleasant epoch" to be the responsibility of an evil demon. Schuler died during an operation meant to remove a malignant tumour.
"Blood Beacon" and "Cosmic Circle".
At the turn of the nineteenth century the Munich borough of Schwabing became the center of certain anti-bourgeois forces tending towards an interest in the 'occult', among which were found the secretive cult of the 'Blutleuchte' ("Blood beacon"). An occult circle ("Munich Cosmic Circle") gravitating around Karl Wolfskehl, Alfred Schuler and Ludwig Klages developed a doctrine according to which the Occident was plagued by downfall and degeneration, caused by the rationalizing and demythologizing effects of Christianity, held to be responsible for the betrayal of life's primary forces. A way out of this desolate state could, according to the "Cosmic" view, only be found by a return to the pagan origins. No exact common ground did however exist, as to what this "homecoming" would entail.
Alfred Schuler and Ludwig Klages came to know each other in 1893. They were, above all others, the leading personalities of the "Blutleuchte" and, with a few other 'initiates' such as Ludwig Derleth and the poet Karl Wolfskehl, the founders of this "occult circle". The first contact with Stefan George was established through Wolfskehl. 
As clearly signalled by the name - "Blutleuchte" - "Blood" and "Light" were to play an important role. With the historical "degeneration of the blood", held to be a sacred life elixir and a metaphysical substrate of souls, "truthful" life was seen as sinking into an ever more weakened state. And thus it was found to be necessary to lead this conception of the blood up to its former state of light and power, as it was thought to have been in heathen times thousands of years ago, and to some degree in antiquity. In the sign of the "Blood Beacon" and the swastika, its incarnate emblem, a healthy state of life were to be regained. 
From a chosen few, among which they imagined themselves to be and in which the "untainted blood" was supposed to be still working its healthy influence, a reversal was thought to be possible. By the work of these chosen few, the "incarnation of the undying spark of a distant past" (L. Klages), the founding energies of the "cosmic solstice" were to be rekindled. The occult practices of the "Blutleuchte" was supposed to be a symbiosis of heathendom and "lordly leadership" in the service of a wayward humanity in need of a fundamental rebirth.
Influence.
The influence of the "Cosmic Circle" on Stefan George and his entourage is apparent by his use of the swastika in some of his publications, such as the "Blätter für die Kunst". The "cosmic" influence can also be traced in the article "The Seventh Circle" and in his later work. As there was, however, in 1904, a rupture between George and the Schuler circle, its overt influence was intermittent. 
From about the turn of the century Schuler kept in touch with occultists such as Henri Papus, and later took part in spiritualist séances directed by Albert von Schrenck-Notzing. Schuler also held a large number of lectures on "ancient heathen mysteries"; and in the "salon" of Elsa Bruckmann a series of speeches (from 1915 to 1923) on the subject of "the eternal city". Rainer Maria Rilke is known to have been present during Schuler's speeches. 
The research into Schuler's life has been predominantly concerned with the memetic influence he may have exerted upon certain progenitors of German National Socialism, spurred by his anti-Judaism, his distinct employment of the swastika and, above all, by Robert Boehringer's thesis that Adolf Hitler may have met Schuler in the "salon Bruckmann". Despite his anti-Semitism, Schuler was however neither a National Socialist nor a member of any political party and it may seem likely that he would have found the active, public agitation of a politician to be a sacrilege against his gnostic beliefs. He is also known to have criticized the "nationalist tumour", and the "Hitler group" as representing the "drunken torchlight of death, leading people into the slaughterhouse".
In later years Schuler has become the subject of some interest as a poet in his own right and as a forerunner of certain experimental practices of modernist literature.

Lincoln Memorial Tower

The Lincoln Memorial Tower or Lincoln Tower is a Gothic revival tower in London, housing small meeting rooms, that was opened in 1876 in memory of Abraham Lincoln, and paid for partly by Americans. Once part of a complex of nineteenth century philanthropic institutions sited alongside a Congregational chapel, it is all that now remains of the original design. It is located at the corner of Westminster Bridge Road and Kennington Road close to Waterloo Station and Lambeth North tube station in London, and is today a listed building associated with, and close to, "Christ Church and Upton Chapel".
Origins.
The Lincoln Tower is built on the site of an orphanage for females, founded in 1758. When the orphanage closed in the mid nineteenth century, its site was acquired by trustees of the Surrey Chapel on nearby Blackfriars Road, whose own chapel lease was due to expire. This larger site provided them with ample opportunity to fund-raise not only for a new Congregational chapel which they named Christ Church, but also for a large complex of ancillary buildings.
The pastor of Surrey Chapel at the time was the energetic Christopher Newman Hall who had lectured and written extensively in support of Abraham Lincoln and abolition of slavery during the American Civil War. He raised funds in America for a permanent "International Memorial" in London, to Abraham Lincoln, and incorporated this into plans for redevelopment of the former orphanage site.
The Lincoln Tower was opened on 4 July 1876, the centenary of American independence. The foundation stone had been laid two years earlier, on 9 July 1874, by the American ambassador, His Excellency General Schenk. The two main rooms in the tower were named the "Washington" and the "Wilberforce" rooms.
Architecture and design.
The original design by the architect E.C.Robins, developed in 1873, would have placed the tower and spire as an elevated structure above the centre of the new Congregational chapel. This was adapted in the final scheme by architects Paull and Bickerdike, who kept much of the original design and detailing of the building complex as a whole, but gave greater prominence to the Lincoln Tower. This became a stand-alone building with its own ground floor and entrances, though still integral to the complex. As more memorial funds were raised, the new architects, like E.C.Robins before them, added a lofty spire; raising the tower 200 feet high. The spectacular spire incorporated E.C.Robins' concept for an architectural version of 'stars and stripes' - the use of a polychromatic colour scheme of red and white stones.
On the Tower's north entrance, above the apex of a large archway, a stone was added bearing the title "Lincoln Tower". Under the paved basement the coffin of preacher Rowland Hill was re-located from Surrey Chapel, with a tablet inset into the interior wall above. There was another tablet in memory of his successor, James Sherman, with a still larger tablet giving the name and purpose of the tower – to commemorate emancipation by the martyred Lincoln, the contribution of half the cost of the tower by American citizens, and as a pledge of international brotherhood.
The completed tower, built of Kentish Rag stone outside and Bath stone within, and modelled on a Gothic style, was widely regarded at the time as one of the best examples of steeple and tower architecture in south-central London.
Modern context.
Much of the "Christ Church" complex was destroyed in the Second World War, although the Lincoln Tower survived. In the 1950s a large commercial office block, with an integral Congregational and Baptist chapel and community office space, was planned where the nineteenth century "Christ Church" Congregational chapel and its school and meeting rooms (Hawkstone Hall) had stood.
Today, the complex, with its integral "Christ Church and Upton Chapel" form a modernist backdrop to the surviving Gothic Revival tower. The Lincoln Tower, as well as the chapel and adjoining community office space, are presently owned by United Reformed Church (as successors to the Congregationalists) and Baptists, and managed by Oasis Church Waterloo, part of the Oasis Trust charity. The chapel is also open as a cafe.

Bunk Off

"Bunk Off" is the second episode of the first series of "The Inbetweeners". It first aired on 1 May 2008 on E4, along with the first episode. When first broadcast, viewing figures slumped down to 321,000. This episode follows the boys as they bunk off school for a day.
Plot.
The episode starts with all four of the boys congregating in a local park where they reluctantly participate in a game of Frisbee on the insistence of Will (Who admits their ulterior motive for spending time in the park is to become acquainted with girls). A group of events causes Will's Frisbee to come into contact with a disabled females face , for which he strenuously apologizes. Following this, a brief chase ensues in which Mark Donovan, (the school's bully and Will's rival) and several of his friends pursue Will and Simon (Jay and Neil had departed moments before). In the next scene Neil's enthusiasm for failing to attend school the following day dwindles following the events (the disabled girl being hit by the Frisbee) as he believes commit both sins would constitute "bad karma". The plan goes ahead despite Neil's remarks (which appears to have merely been an aside). Will and Simon meet up and Simon (poorly) impersonates his mother to inform the school they are ill and will not attend school that day, Mr Gilbert angrily reveals that he has seen through Simon's impersonation. They meet up with Jay and Neil, and Will manages to buy them all alcohol(wearing a suit belonging to Simon's father) despite being underage.
After this they head back to Neil's house and begin drinking. To their surprise, Neil's dad returns to his home, but Will, who is drunk, bullies Neil's dad about his alleged homosexuality by inventing the term "Bumder"- claiming in his narration to have regretted stating such comments in retrospect (He later explains the term "bumder" is a cross between a bummer and a bender). Neil's dad is understandably furious, and the boys(predictably excluding Neil) are thrown out. 
Simon then becomes desperate to admit to his childhood friend Carli D'Amato of his romantic admiration towards her. Will Jay and Simon commute to Carli's house and, after some convincing from Will and Jay, he sprays "I love Carli D'Amato" on her driveway in spray paint, only to be embarrassed when Carli and her friends turn up. However, when Carli sees Simon's friends laughing at him for his elaborate gesture, she invites him to her house. Believing that he has a chance with Carli, Will comes along to babysit her little brother and ends up scaring him by impulsively informing him of the nature of terrorism(presumably as he was still intoxicated). Simon, whose intoxication is more severe ends vomiting on several areas of her kitchen and eventually Carli's younger brother after drunkenly requesting she perform sexual acts on herself.
Will and Simon leave Carli's house, and are confronted by their parents as well as Neil's father, regarding several of the dubious acts they had engaged in (i.e. impersonating Simon's mother, spray painting on Carli's driveway, drunkenly insulting Neil's father) Will's . Their attempts to justify their actions by claiming to be alcoholics hinder the situation and the adults present simply begin to uncontrollably laugh.
The episode ends the next day at school with Simon and Will re uniting with Jay and Neil and informing them of the events they were not present to witness, which the two draw amusement from. The four boys are confronted by Mr. Gilbert , who is indifferent towards Neil and Jay's failure to attend school (as sixth formers they are under no legal obligation to do so) but he is angered by Simon's fraudulent attempts to impersonate his own mother over the phone, for which he is aware Will was complicit. As Will's closing narration that highlights certain events of the episode is displayed, Will and Simon wait outside the headteacher's office, ready for their punishment.

Lactarius rufus

Lactarius rufus is a common, medium sized member of the "Lactarius" genus, whose many members are commonly known as milkcaps. Known by the common name of the Rufous Milkcap, or the Red Hot Milk Cap in North America. It is dark brick red in color, edible, and grows with pine or birch trees. 
Taxonomy.
Described originally by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, and later by the Swedish father of modern mycology Elias Magnus Fries. The specific epithet "rufus" is a reference to its colour.
Description.
The cap is up to in diameter. It is dark brick, bay, or red-brown. At first it is convex, and often has a small central boss (umbo), but later flattens, eventually acquiring a shallow central depression. The surface is dry and matt. The concolorous, but paler stem often becomes hollow with age. The gills are slightly decurrent, cream, becoming coloured as the cap later, only paler. The spore print is creamy white, with a slight salmon tinge. The flesh is white, as is the milk, which tastes mild initially, gradually becoming very hot, and acrid after a minute or so.
Distribution and habitat.
"Lactarius rufus" appears from late spring to late autumn. It is frequent in the northern temperate zones in Europe and North America. It is most commonly found with pine trees, but can also appear with birch, or spruce. It is common in northern California, and the Pacific Northwest from late summer to early winter.
Edibility.
"Lactarius rufus" is generally not recommended for consumption. However, it is used in some places as a condiment after special treatment, and mycologist David Arora notes that it is eaten in Scandinavian countries after canning, and also mentions that there may be edibility differences in North American and European versions of the mushroom. In order to eat these mushrooms, you will have to cook them approximately 10 minutes in plenty of water. After this, you can either preserve them in vinegar or salt water or freeze them lightly salted. These mushrooms make a great salad, with mayonnaise, cream and onions.
Be careful when tasting for identification purposes, and only take a tiny piece. The delayed action effect masks an extremely hot (maybe the hottest) mushroom.

Paul Sciacca

Paul Sciacca (pronounced "SHAH-kah") (June 15, 1909 – August 1986) was a New York City mobster who became boss of the Bonanno crime family. 
Bonanno family war.
In 1964, a rivalry in the Bonanno crime family started when boss Joseph Bonanno promoted his son Salvatore "Bill" Bonanno to the position of consigliere over senior capo Gaspar DiGregorio. The family broke into two factions; the Bonanno faction and DiGregorio-Sciacca faction. On January 28, 1966, an attempt was made on the life of Salvatore "Bill" Bonanno, the son of Joseph Bonanno. The Bonanno's suspected Paul Sciacca and his crew, who were loyal to Gaspar DiGregorio. The newspapers began calling the Bonanno family war the "Bananas War". 
The shooting war began in May 1966 with what became known as "The Troutman St. Ambush", where Bill Bonanno and three of his associates were lured to an alleged peace meeting and then ambushed from doorways, windows and rooftops along Troutman Street, but Bonanno and his associates escaped unharmed. Paul Sciacca and underling Frank Mari were suspected of masterminding the botched hit, but boss Gaspar DiGregorio was blamed for the bad publicity and added police scrutiny that surrounded the shooting. 
After Joe Bonanno was deposed by the Commission in late 1964, DiGregorio was named boss by early 1965, he made Pietro "Skinny Pete" Crociata the new underboss and Nicolino "Nick" Alfano the new consigliere. By 1966, the Commission lost faith in DiGregorio's ability to lead the crime family, and Sciacca became the acting boss. 
The "Bananas War" raged throughout the second half of the 1960s with Sciacca and his top lieutenant, Frank Mari leading the dissident faction of soldiers and shooters against the Bonanno loyalists. Less than a dozen men were killed during the war, but many low level soldiers and men on both sides were beaten, shot and injured, Sciacca was himself the victim of an attempt on his life. The war should have ended when deposed boss Joe Bonanno suffered a heart attack in 1968 and promised to retire to leave New York for the his home in Tucson, Arizona, where he would retire comfortably with a handful of loyal underlings at his side. Also, by 1968, Bonanno successor DiGregorio was in ill health and stepped down as boss and retired, dying only two years later. The Commission sanctioned acting boss Paul Sciacca as the new boss of the Bonanno crime family. Sciacca promoted, who he thought to be a loyal underling, Frank Mari to be his new underboss, while another Sciacca underling, Michael "Mike" Adamo was promoted to consigliere. Unknown to boss Sciacca, soon after their promotions, Mari and Adamo began to plot against him and planned to remove him from power and possibly eliminate him all together, but their plans were revealed and on the night of September 18, 1968 both men disappeared, never to be heard from again. Bonanno soldier and former Mari underling Philip "Rusty" Rastelli, a former Bonanno loyalist, who switched allegiance to the DiGregoiro-Sciacca side at the start of the war became a top suspect in the case for New York City police, having also been a top suspect in the Troutman Street ambush. Rastelli, who was promoted to caporegime of the old Mari crew, was never charged in connection with either the ambush or the disappearance, but he was promoted once again to consigliere by boss Paul Sciacca immediately following the disappearance of Adamo, while former Bonanno loyalist Natale Joe Diamonds" Evola was promoted to underboss in place of Mari.
The new boss.
Due to the "Bananas War", in 1968 the The Commission forced DiGregorio to retire and officially promoted Sciacca to boss. He became boss of a much weakened crime family as rivalries and internal dissension continued between the former DiGregorio-Sciacca faction and the remaining Bonanno loyalists. Hostilities continued within the Bonanno crime family into 1969, the last known Bonanno crime family member to be killed was soldier Thomas Zummo, a former DiGregorio-Sciacca faction member, who was shot dead on May 6, 1969. With the removal of disloyal underlings, Mari and Adamo, Bonanno boss Paul Sciacca attempted to unite his crime family once again by promoting the leaders of the two most influential factions outside his own. Longtime family member and former Bonanno loyalist Natale Evola was leader of what remained of the former Bonanno faction, while Phil Rastelli had gained a great deal of influence with the younger, up and coming members of the crime family and was now the leader of the "young turks" faction. By promoting Evola to underboss and Rastelli to consigliere, Sciacca hoped to align the Bonanno crime family and bring it back to the level of power and influence within the New York Mafia it once occupied. In terms of numbers the Bonanno crime family had always been one of the smaller of the Five Families, but it was also one of the most cohesive and well structured crime families because most of its administration was family members related by blood or marriage. Now Sciacca hoped to at least mend the broken ties among members and re-align the three most influential factions within the Bonanno crime family, effectively removing the last of the rivalries and hostilities that were still present, creating cohesion and stability. 
On May 13, 1971, Sciacca was indicted in Mineola, New York on charges of selling $100,000 worth of heroin. 
The charge was later dismissed.

Toa Payoh Town Park

Toa Payoh Town Park is located at the junction of Toa Payoh Lor 2 and Toa Payoh Lor 6.
History.
The park, previously known as Toa Payoh Town Garden, was completed in 1973. Its main features are an observation tower and a landscaped pond with willowing trees. 
In the seventies, the town garden was a favored venue for outdoor wedding photography. It was popular with visitors who came from near and far to enjoy the display of willows, bamboos and the brilliant reds and yellows of the "Delonix regia" trees. At the heart of the garden is a 0.8 ha pond which contains a small waterfall and a cluster of artificial islands linked by bridges. Fishes and tortoises populate the pond, and the islands are arranged to provide a sequence of delightful walking experiences. 
The observation tower is now not open to the public and there has been no plans announced by the National Parks Board to reopen it (as of 1 Sep 2011). There is a fountain pool installed around the tower.
The Toa Payoh Town Garden was partially closed in 1999 to make way for a temporary bus interchange. After the new Toa Payoh Bus Interchange at the HDB Hub was completed in June 2002, the temporary bus interchange was converted to a landscaped park. Toa Payoh Town Garden was subsequently renamed Toa Payoh Town Park.
Visitor Info.
Toa Payoh Town Park is located directly opposite the Toa Payoh Bus Interchange and Toa Payoh MRT Station. The park has limited parking space, which is only available to patrons of the Chinese restaurant operating inside the park. 
The park has no gates and is open to the public at all times. It is equipped with open-concept restrooms, a large pavilion with a stage for organised activities, gazebos, foot reflexology footpaths and a jogging path. 
The Chinese restaurant operating inside the park specializes in Taiwan porridge (congee), and is located in a building beside the pond. Near this building is an overhead bridge that connects Toa Payoh Town Park to Jalan Rajah.

Albotin Monastery

Albotin Monastery (, also: "Albutin Monastery", Албутински манастир) is a presently inactive Bulgarian medieval cave monastery on the territory of Kula bishopric of Vidin Diocese of Bulgarian Orthodox Church, in the locality Albotin ("Albutin") along river Topolovets between villages Gradets and Rabrovo, nearby village Deleyna.
The monastery complex was built in the limestone rock massif on the northern side of the river, on some 25 metres height, using shallow natural caves and rock sheds, with additionally hewn premises and niches with religious and every-day purposes. The monastery is reached by a steep and narrow sandy pathway in the beginning of which was constructed a water tap, known as "Haiduk cheshma". Being easily accessible, in later times the cave monastery was used by shepherds and stone-cutters as a shelter, and robbed and vandalized by treasure-hunters.
Albotin monastery was active in the 14th century according to the account of the preserved fragments of frescoes and inscriptions, as well as adornments (earrings, tabs, bracelets) found in the 29 discovered Christian graves. The large number of burials of laity among the clergymen is an evidence that the monastery was a reputable sanctuary and a desired place for the eternal peace of its donors. Among the scarce historic records, it is noteworthy the mentioning of the nowadays non-existent village "Altovin" in a registry of Vidin kaaza (district) from year 1560.
The monastery complex consists of eight premises in a row, with the church located in the middle sector, in the most concave part of the rock massif curve. The church contains three naves and is oriented according to the canon from west to east, its southern and southwestern parts being fully devastated. The presence of a baptisterium bespeaks of the temple being used not only for monastic praying but also for public liturgies. In the north-western of the monastery, there is a second floor, containing the second largest premise of the monastery, which was presumably used for a refectory. In the western part of the monastery other cloiser premises were located: the monks cells, kitchen, cellar, store-rooms. Two water tanks can also be seen.
The name of the monastery church is unknown, but there are suppositions that it was devoted to the Resurrection of Jesus, due to the preserved old tradition of playing chain dances (horo) in the memory of the deceased on the second day of Easter. This custom is widely observed by Vlachs who hang the portraits of their dead relatives on the branches of a venerable tree in the meadow under the monastery. Each of the chain dances played before noon-time is devoted to a separate dead man, and the afternoon dances are devoted to the living people. Bulgarians and Vlachs pick up dictamnus and hand out a sprig per each deceased relative.
The Albotin cave monastery was announced monument of culture in the Bulgarian state gazette on 28 December 1927, Issue 221, and on 26 December 1969, Issue 100.

Henry Fielding Dickens

Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, KC (16 January 1849 – 21 December 1933) was the eighth of ten children born to British author Charles Dickens and his wife Catherine. The most successful of all of Dickens's children, he was a barrister, a KC and Common Serjeant of London, a senior legal office which he held for over 15 years.
Early life.
Baptized in the church of St. Mary Marylebone in London on 21 April 1849, Henry Fielding Dickens was named after Henry Fielding, one of his father's favourite authors. His father had originally thought to name him after Oliver Goldsmith, but thinking that his son would constantly be teased as "Oliver asking for more", he changed his mind. His family nicknames were 'H', 'Mr Harry', and 'Mr H'. While a boy living at Gads Hill Place, his father's country home, he, with his brother Edward, started the 'Gad's Hill Gazette', a family newspaper printed on a small printing press given to him by Mr Wills, the sub-editor of "All the Year Round". His father, Charles Dickens, and H F Chorley were contributors. Dickens was educated at Wimbledon School at Wimbledon and at Mr Gibson's boarding school in Boulogne-sur-Mer, along with his brothers Alfred and Sydney. He became the only one of Dickens's six sons to attend university.
Legal career.
He attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge from 1868, graduating BA in Mathematics (29th Wrangler) in 1872 before studying Law at the university. Of that period at Cambridge, Dickens later wrote:
"Looking back now upon the years that are gone, I find that there are one or two scenes or incidents which arise with astonishing vividness to my mind that may be worth recording...I hope it will not be thought that I tell this story vaingloriously, as it was but a small matter so far as I was concerned. Nothing is farther from my thoughts. I do so because it is typical of a strange reticence on father's part, an intense dislike of 'letting himself go' in private life or of using language which might be deemed strained or over-effusive; though, as will be seen later, when he was deeply moved he was at no pains to hide the depth of his emotion. Thus it came about that, though his children knew he was devotedly attached to them, there was still a kind of reserve on his part which seemed occasionally to come as a cloud between us and which I never quite understood."
"In the year 1869, after I had been at college about a year, I was fortunate enough to gain one of the principal scholarships at Trinity Hall, Cambridge -- not a great thing, only 50 pounds a year; but I knew that this success, slight as it was, would give him intense pleasure, so I went to meet him at Higham Station upon his arrival from London to tell him of it. As he got out of the train I told him the news. He said, 'Capital! capital!' -- nothing more. Disappointed to find that he received the news apparently so lightly, I took my seat beside him in the pony carriage he was driving. Nothing more happened until we had got half-way to Gad's Hill, when he broke down completely. Turning towards me with tears in his eyes and giving me a warm grip of the hand, he said, 'God bless you, my boy; God bless you!' That pressure of the hand I can feel now as distinctly as I felt it then, and it will remain as strong and real until the day of my death."
In 1873 he was called to the Bar, and in 1892 he was appointed Queen's Counsel. In 1899 he became a Bencher of the Inner Temple. Sir Henry's best recalled case was his defence of Kitty Byron for the murder of her lover in 1902. Although she was convicted, Dickens's defence was so spirited that she was given a reduced prison sentence due to public petition.
For some years he was the Recorder for Deal and Maidstone in Kent. His interests included fencing, and he was the first President of the Chatham Yachting Club. He succeeded Sir Frederick Albert Bosanquet as Common Serjeant of London in November 1917, an ancient office first recorded in 1291 with the appointment of Thomas Juvenal, and the second most senior judicial position at the Old Bailey after the Recorder of London. As Common Serjeant Dickens judged criminal trials at the Old Bailey for over 15 years, retiring on 18 October 1932. He was succeeded by Cecil Whiteley KC. 
On one occasion Dickens was judging a case when the male prisoner interrupted him by saying "You ain't a patch on your father." "I quite agree with you. What do you know of my father?" Dickens replied. The prisoner, who had spent most of his life in prison, answered "Well, I have read some in prison." "Have you?", Dickens replied, "that's capital; for you will now have eighteen months in which to resume your studies." He repeatedly refused nominations for election to Parliament, believing it would adversely affect his legal practice.
Later years.
At family Christmas gatherings at his home at 8 Mulberry Walk in London he performed imitations of his father giving his famous "Readings", during which he would wear a geranium, his father's favorite flower, and lean on the same velvet-covered reading stand used by Charles Dickens during his reading tours. He had listened to his father many times, and older members of his audience said Henry Dickens's performances were amazingly like those given by his father. To celebrate his eightieth birthday in 1929 he went through the whole of "A Christmas Carol" without a hitch, his false teeth loosening at the melodramatic sections: 'I know him - Marley's ghosht!'.
From October 1914 he performed the recitals of his father's works in support of the Red Cross Society. These included excerpts from "David Copperfield", "A Christmas Carol", "The Chimes", and "The Cricket on the Hearth". Through his efforts he raised £1,200 for the Society. He was a Life President of the Dickens Fellowship.
Personal life.
Henry 'Harry' Dickens married Marie Roche (1852 – 1940), the daughter of Monsieur Antonin Roche, on 25 October 1876 in Portman Square in London; they had four sons and three daughters together. Within the Dickens Family the couple were known as 'The Guvnor' and 'The Mater'. Their son Philip Charles Dickens is buried beside them in Putney Vale Cemetery in London, while a second son, Henry Charles Dickens, was the father of the author Monica Dickens. Henry was a long serving member of Kensington Council in London where he was very active in improving housing in the poorer part of the borough after World War II; a block of flats in North Kensington is named after him. On his retirement when the borough was amalgamated with Chelsea in 1955 he was created an honorary Freeman. A third son, Cedric 'Ceddy' Dickens, was killed on 9 September 1916 during the battle of Ginchy during World War I.
Dickens was also the father of Admiral Sir Gerald Charles Dickens and the grandfather of Cedric Charles Dickens, an author and the steward of Charles Dickens's literary legacy. He is the great grandfather of actor and performer Gerald Dickens and the great great grandfather of biographer and writer Lucinda Hawksley.
Dickens was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1922, and retired in August 1932. He died in 1933 two weeks after being hit by a motorcycle while crossing Chelsea Embankment at his usual place and by his usual method of warning motorists by holding up his walking stick and stepping out into the road. He was the last surviving child of Charles Dickens.
Henry Fielding Dickens was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.

Signe Hammarsten-Jansson

Signe "Ham" Hammarsten-Jansson (née. Hammarsten, 1 June 1882 Hannäs, Sweden - 6 June 1970 Porvoo) was a Swedish graphic artist who designed, among other things, around 220 Finnish postage stamps during the course of three decades. She was the mother of Tove Jansson, creator of the highly successful "Moomin" characters.
Biography.
Signe Hammarsten came from a respectable Swedish clerical family and was the child of a pastor's daughter and a court chaplain. Hammarsten's parents were opposed to her becoming an artist, and as a girl she had considered a career as a surgeon. Hammarsten went through 8 years of primary school, and then studied at Stockholm University between 1901 and 1905. She began to work as a drawing teacher at a Stockholm girls' school.
It was during a study trip to Paris in 1910 that Hammarsten met and fell in love with the 24-year-old Finnish sculptor, Viktor Jansson. In 1913 they were married and they lived in Paris for a year before moving to Finland in 1915. A daughter was born to the couple shortly thereafter, and Hammarsten-Jansson resumed work as an illustrator. In 1924, Hammarsten-Jansson became a draughtsperson for the Bank of Finland. Here, between 1929 and 1962, Hammarsten-Jansson designed over 200 stamps.
The couple had three children in total: Tove Jansson, Lars Jansson and Per Olov Jansson. Born to artistic parents, the children grew up in a Bohemian lifestyle, and all became artists in their own right. Tove became a writer and painter and would gain particular fame for her "Moomin" series. Lars became a cartoonist, ultimately becoming responsible for the "Moomin" comic strips as well as a later animated version. Per Olov became a photographer and collaborated with Tove on a few books. The children were directly influenced by their mother's artistic sensibilities and Tove in particular retained a close connection, only leaving the house at age 28.
Tove has written that she felt her mother understood her better than anyone else and even toward the end of her life, Tove "always tried to resemble Mother, always tried to draw like [her Mother." In 1928, at age 14, Tove noted that "Mother has important drawing work. (...) I am waiting for the time when I will be able to help her with her drawings. Mother does so much work by herself." Hammarsten-Jansson's death in 1970 profoundly impacted her daughter's writing and it has been suggested that her presence is strongly felt in a number of the books Tove wrote after the death. The melancholic "Sent i November" (1970) deals themes of leaving and loneliness, and is typically considered the most mature of the "Moomin" series. "Sommarboken" (1972) concerns a young girl whose mother has died and her relationship with her grandmother. Hammarsten-Jansson's death marked the end of the "Moomin" series of novels and Jansson's literary output became primarily adult-oriented.

<doc id="19315902" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19315902" title="Florida Amendment 2">
Florida Amendment 2

Florida Amendment 2 is an amendment made to the Constitution of Florida in 2008. It added Article I, Section 27 to the constitution, which defines marriage as a union only between one man and one woman, and thus bans the creation of similar unions, such as civil unions or same-sex marriage.
Text.
Amendment 2 added Article I Section 27 of the Florida constitution. This states:
The initiative.
The amendment was proposed by means of the initiative process, and went before the voters of Florida in a referendum held on November 4, 2008. Similar proposals were put to a vote at the same time in Arizona (Proposition 102) and California (Proposition 8).
Proposed constitutional amendments in Florida require 611,009 signatures, including at least 8% of voters in the last presidential election and at least 8% of voters in each congressional district of Florida. The initiative was certified with 649,346 signatures and was placed on the ballot on February 2008. 60% of voters were required to pass the amendment in Florida.
A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll on September 8, 2008 showed that 55% favored the proposed amendment, while 41% oppose it. "Florida and Arizona joined 27 other states that previously approved such amendments."
The amendment was ultimately passed by a margin of 61.9% in favor and 38.1% opposed. In the Florida 2008 election, Barack Obama voters as a whole voted 57% against Amendment 2 while John McCain voters voted 81% in favor of the legislation. Republican Governor Charlie Crist publicly supported Amendment 2.
Comparison to Proposition 8.
A similar and more widely controversial ballot initiative in California, Proposition 8, was titled "ELIMINATES RIGHT OF SAME–SEX COUPLES TO MARRY. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT" and summarized accordingly. This description differed from the description of Florida's Amendment 2 in that it referred to a right being removed. 
Another difference between Amendment 2 and Proposition 8 was that the latter did not render domestic partnerships unlawful in California, while the text of Amendment 2 made the recognition of civil unions—or other marriage-like relationships for same-sex couples—unlawful in Florida.
Effect of education.
A study was done to see the effect of education on the votes. Controlling for other socioeconomic and political factors, for each additional 1 percent of a county’s population with a bachelor of arts degree, the study concluded that there was nearly an equal 1 percent decrease in support for Amendment 2. By comparison, every 1 percent increase in a county’s black population led to only two-tenths of a percentage point increase in support for Amendment 2. According to one of the study's authors, "Education is so important because it increases exposure to those who are different. Studies show very clearly that the more educated people are the more tolerant they are of differences.”

Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.

Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), is a United States Supreme Court decision holding that an administrative agency's interpretative rules deserve deference according to their persuasiveness.
Background of the case.
Seven employees of the Swift & Company packing plant at Fort Worth, Texas brought an action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to recover overtime, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees, totaling approximately $77,000. The District Court rendered judgment denying this claim wholly, and the 5th Circuit affirmed.
Issue.
The case examined the deference that was due to the interpretative rules of an administrative agency.
The court's decision.
Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the Court, which held that nothing in statutory law or the decisions of the Court precluded waiting time from also being working time. The opinion introduced a test for determining the deference to be given to an administrative agency's rules. The four-factor test examines: (1) the thoroughness of the agency's investigation; (2) the validity of its reasoning; (3) the consistency of its interpretation over time; and (4) other persuasive powers of the agency.
Subsequent developments.
The continuing vitality of "Skidmore" deference is in question. Justice Scalia, in his concurrence in "Christensen v. Harris County", argued that "Skidmore" has no place post-"Chevron". However, the majority in "Christensen" held that an agency's interpretation of a statute announced in more informal agency papers (such as an opinion letter) is entitled to "Skidmore" deference, not "Chevron" deference.

The law of Gibraltar is a combination of common law and statute, and is based heavily upon English law.
The "English Law (Application) Act" of 1962 stipulates that English common law will apply to Gibraltar unless overridden by Gibraltar law. However, as Gibraltar is a self-governing British overseas territory, it maintains its own independent tax status and its parliament can enact laws independently of the United Kingdom.

Dave Parsons (born David Richard Parsons, 2 July 1965, Hillingdon, London, UK) is a British bass guitarist.
Life and career.
He grew up with his mother, Annie Gration, and his four siblings, Ralph (older brother), Trudi (older sister), Fleur (younger sister), and Rosie (younger sister). He used to be a clerk in a clothes shop, but since then has gone on to play bass guitarist for a number of bands.
Parsons learned to play bass guitar, and amongst the bands he played with were Future Primitive (later to be renamed Bush), Transvision Vamp, The Partisans, and Dig:Dig:Dig. Parsons has noted that some of his biggest musical influences over the years have been David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Bob Marley.
Parsons joined Transvision Vamp after fellow members Wendy James and Nick Christian Sayer had moved to London, and had signed a recording contract with MCA Records in the winter of 1986. Parsons met up with the two at a pub he frequented in Notting Hill. Two months after forming Transvision Vamp, the band recorded "Revolution Baby", followed by the video, and then concentrated on being a live band. By 1988 and 1989, Transvision Vamp were successful worldwide, with hits including "I Want Your Love" and "Baby I Don’t Care". Their third album was released in 1991, but the band then broke up. 
Parsons met up in 1992 with Gavin Rossdale and Nigel Pulsford, adding the drummer Robin Goodridge to eventually become Bush.
On 2 June 2000, Parsons' girlfriend Sarah Chope gave birth to a girl named Eden. Parsons was credited for the original theme to the film short, "Sixty Cups of Coffee", released in 2000. Since Bush stopped touring in 2002 not much news of Parsons has surfaced. He had a second child (Billy) in 2002, and a third (Frank) in 2007. Parsons decided not to be a part of the Bush reunion in 2010.

John W. Jones House

The John W. Jones House currently stands at 1250 Davis Street, Elmira, New York, across from a historic entrance to Woodlawn Cemetery. It is the former home of John W. Jones and current home of the John W. Jones Museum. It stands on part of its original property, though it originally faced College Avenue. Historically, the house was the private residence of John W. Jones and his family, but changed ownership several times since, and was used as rental property that fell into disrepair. Condemned by the City of Elmira in 1997, Lucy Brown brought it to the public’s attention and with a group of concerned citizens, saved it from demolition. It is now the home to the John W. Jones Museum.
Museum.
The Museum has not been officially opened at the time of writing.
The museum emphasizes Elmira’s role as the only regular agency and published station on the Underground Railroad between Philadelphia and St. Catherine, Canada, and explores Mr. Jones’s community involvement and his relationship with his contemporaries. It also highlights the history of African Americans who settled in the Southern Tier of New York and the activity of local abolitionists.
John W. Jones.
John W. Jones came to Elmira as an escaped slave from Virginia in the 1840s. He was an active abolitionist and worked extensively with the Underground Railroad. He became sexton of Woodlawn Cemetery. During the American Civil War, he was responsible for burying the Confederate dead from the nearby Elmira prison camp in the section of the cemetery that eventually became Woodlawn National Cemetery. The John W. Jones House is built, at least in part, from portions of the camp sold at auction upon its disbandment. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Massey-Harris Model 101

The Massey-Harris Model 101 was a tractor built by Massey-Harris (later Massey Ferguson) from 1938-1946. Developed under the guidance of James S. Duncan, who gambled corporate losses would drop and won, the 101 introduced the Chrysler L-head inline six. The six would compete with Oliver's straight-six Model 70, while saving money on development of a whole new engine as well as taking advantage of Chrysler's existing parts and service network.
Specification.
The 101 used the 201 in³ (3,292 cc) six, taking advantage of its stock electric start, a first in a tractor. Run at much lower revs than the truck engine, the 101 came in the usual standard and row-crop models, with four-speed transmission, and was capable of 20 mph (32 km/h) on roads. The row-crop model offered adjustable rear wheel spacing and rear wheel brakes, as well as PTO. There was also a rare model with a single front wheel. They also featured hood sides with dozens of louvers, which disappeared late in 1941. The Super was upgraded to the 217 in³ (3,554 cc) Chrysler in 1940, giving it almost 50 hp (37 kW) at the belt, making it one of the most powerful tractors on the market that year. It continued to be used in the 101 Super until 1940, when it was supplanted by the 217 in³ (3,554 cc).
Pricing.
With a base price of around C$1100, the 101 was about C$200 more than the John Deere A. and competitive with Ford and Ferguson-Brown models of the period. Yet the top-selling tractors were all lighter and much cheaper.
Model 101 Junior.
To address this, the Model 101 was joined in 1939 by the "entry level" two-plow Model 101 Junior with Chrysler's inline four, while the six-cylinder model became the 101 Super. The Junior, comparable to the Deere Model H, used the same 124 in³ (2,031 cc) engine of the later 81 and 20, and produced 31 hp (23 kW) at the belt, Manufactured by Continental, it was used in many Massey Harris tractors at the time, as well as by the Cockshutt 20 and Oliver Super 44. The comparable kerosene (tractor vaporising oil, or TVO, in Britain) version was known as the 102 Junior. In 1940, the 124 in³ engine was replaced by a 140 in³ (2,293 cc) Continental of 19 drawbar/23 belt hp (14/17 kW) and in 1943 with a 162 in³ (2,654 cc) version.
Production.
While the C$895 Junior sold nearly 28,000 units by 1946, it could not match the 60,000 each of the Deere H and Allis-Chalmers B, 180,000 of the Farmall A, and was barely a fraction of Ford's 260,000 9Ns. The Model 101 Super ended production in 1942. The 101 Junior persisted until 1946, while the waning sales of the 102 Junior saw the name pass to overseas sales.

Dering Roll

The Dering Roll is the oldest English roll of arms surviving in its original form. It was made between 1270 and 1280 and contains the coat of arms of 324 knights, starting with two illegitimate children of King John. Sir Edward Dering acquired the roll during the 17th century and modified it to include a fictitious ancestor of his own. It was eventually purchased by the British Library (as Add Roll 77720) following fund raising involving a number of other charities and individuals.
Glover's Roll, made in 1586, is a copy of a now lost roll dating from even earlier, from the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272).
Description.
The Dering Roll depicts the coats of arms of around a quarter of the English baronage during the era of Edward I. Emphasis was given to knights from Sussex and Kent, as it was produced in Dover between 1270 and 1280 and the document was designed to list the knights who owed feudal service there. It depicts 324 coats of arms, beginning with Richard Fitz Roy and William de Say, two of King John's illegitimate sons. The shields are arranged in 54 rows, with six shields on each line. Above each shield reads the knight's name, except in six cases where it has been omitted or removed. Stephen de Pencester may have commissioned the roll during his time as Constable of Dover Castle.
Sir Edward Dering acquired it whilst lieutenant of Dover Castle, and modified the roll after 1638, removing the coat of arms of Nicholas de Croill and inserting his own coat of arms with a fictitious ancestor named Richard fitz Dering in order to prove the history of his own family.
During the 20th century it was acquired by Sir Anthony Wagner. On 4 December 2007, the roll was sold at auction at Sotheby's for the sum of £192,000 to a private individual who subsequently applied for an export licence. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport placed a temporary block on the roll being moved overseas and the British Library led efforts to purchase it, after the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art confirmed it to be of sufficient importance and significance. The library raised £194,184 to acquire the roll; the Head of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts, Claire Breay said of the purchase, "the acquisition of the Dering Roll provides an extremely rare chance to add a manuscript of enormous local and national significance." They were assisted in funding the purchase from The Art Fund (£40,000), the National Heritage Memorial Fund (£100,000), Friends of the British Library (£10,000), Friends of the National Libraries (£10,000), and a number of individual benefactors. It is now on display at the Sir John Ritblat Gallery in the British Library, and available to researchers in the library's manuscripts reading room.

Galanite

Svenska Galanite Industri, usually known simply as Galanite, was a Swedish vinyl and plastic company based in Löddeköpinge, which made mostly toys. Cars were the most popular, but trucks, farm vehicles and airplanes were also produced.
History.
The plastics company Galanite was started in 1947 by two Danish immigrants to Sweden named Louis Hawaleska and Borje Hansen. The first product was a transparent ball with an angel inside. Galanite became a supplier of plastic parts for industry, including supplying parts for Saab and Volvo. Their toy cars, however, soon became the mainstay of the company. When the company prospered in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, it employed 125 people (Plastibar site). Varied plastics were used; soft PVC (for toys), polyethylene and polystyrene. 
Toy Type.
Most Galanite cars produced were in the four inch range at a scale of 1:42, but the company also made large pedal cars. Swedish vehicles were common like Volvo, Saab, and Scania trucks, but Volkswagens and other vehicles like Mercedes Benz and the BMC Mini were also made. Like most rubber vehicles, construction was of only seven parts: a molded vinyl body, two metal axles, and four plastic tires. These toys were child friendly - soft vinyl, rounded edges and fun colours.
Other Galanite Toys were of a larger proportion (1:30) and had a less realistic design, with some of the cleaner edges of the true design of a car softened or abstracted for instance. Models are not numbered on the bottom and usually simply say "Galanite Sweden".
Almost Promotionals.
Approximate dates of production for Galanite Toys were the late 1960s through the 1970s. Items produced are similar in concept to what Tomte Laerdal produced in Norway, or what Auburn Rubber Company produced in the United States.
Some examples were exceptionally detailed for vinyl such as the SAAB 96 with a very accurate front end, accurate body proportions and SAAB logo on the trunk lid. The model almost appears to be a company promotional, but none approach the detail of Finnish Stahlberg Models which were purpose built as promotional models for SAAB and Volvo.
Company Details.
Galanite was sold in 1971 to Branch & Co., and three years later the company moved to a new factory in Arlöv. Galanite went into liquidation in 1979. The company named changed a few years later to Bengtsfors Plastics Industry, which also went out of business. Later, MPV purchased the Galanite name. Some cars were thus made by MPV but marked Galanite. Interestingly, a unique collaboration existed between the Nordic toy manufacturers, which often sold their molds to each other. Galanite toys have also been made by HP-Plast in Denmark, by Giske in Norway and by Plasto in Finland.

Slimmy

Slimmy, born Paulo Fernandes, is a Portuguese singer/songwriter who combines various genres of rock, especially electro rock. He has an irreverent visual look and an addictive musical style and has achieved mainstream success after an appearance on the Portuguese soap opera Morangos com Açúcar. His music has also appeared in one episode of . His song, "Self Contro"l, has been featured on Sky Sports.
Life and career.
1999–2005: early life and career beginnings.
In 1999 and 2000, Slimmy’s career took hold from the impact generated around a third prize at the Roland Masters Of The Groove 2000. From that point he began to develop a musical approach that combined rhythms and electronic instrumentation of dance within the rock genre. The first demos were recorded with producer Rodolfo Cardoso in 2003. The collection that had been developed during the previous years did not pass unnoticed by the national and international music scene, catching the attention of noticeables such as Quico Serrano, Alvaro Costa and Saul Davies of the British band James who would later work on Slimmy’s debut studio album in 2007. In 2004, after studio work and varied concerts, Slimmy relocated to London, performing in reputable venues such as the Dublin Castle, Hope and Anchor, Rhythm Factory, Bull and Gate, materialising in an opening slot on the tour of the American English Electric 6. In 2005, Slimmy began to reach the UK media with airplay on Virgin FM and XFM.
2006–present: career breakthrough, "Beatsound Loverboy, Be Someone Else" and "Freestyle Heart".
In 2007, Slimmy returned to Portugal, embarking on an extensive national tour in preparation for the release of his debut album “Beatsound Loverboy”, on the Som Livre label. The album features a fusion of rock and electro music, releasing three singles, “Beatsound Loverboy”, “Show Girl” and “You Should Never Leave Me”. The music video for “Show Girl” gained controversy for its revealing lesbian content. “Beatsound Loverboy” and “You Should Never Leave Me” appeared on the “Morangos com Açúcar” soundtrack and the album was voted the 3rd best national album of the past 15 years, chosen by the listeners of the national radio station Antena 3. The year 2008 began with a new tour, with Slimmy presenting the full album throughout the country. The album garnered much recognition within the media and earned Slimmy a nomination for “Golden Globe Newcomer of the Year” as well as a nomination in the “MTV Europe Music Awards” for “Best Portuguese Act”. Slimmy edited in digital format the “Slimmy Unplugged”, his only live album to date, with 13 songs, recorded live at Salon Castelense in June of that year.
In late 2009 Slimmy's career was divided between live performances and studio work, where he began recording on the album "Be Someone Else", eventually released in June 2010. Recorded between studios Aguda (Portugal) and the studios Wrong Planet (UK), "Be Someone Else" enlisted the production of Quico Serrano and Mark Turner. The album marked a change in line up for the band with Slimmy on voice and guitar, Paulo Garim on bass and Tozé on drums, joined by guest musicians on Gustavo Silva programming and keyboards, and Daniel Santos on guitar. This album features 11 tracks in the same musical style of "Beatsound Loverboy", but focused more on Electro music. The album also featured two singles, "The Games You Play" and "Be Someone Else". Promotional concerts ensued until the end of the year.
In 2012, Slimmy began work on "Freestyle Heart", developing demos with Canadian producer Andrew Torrence. Recording commenced in Portugal in April of that year and marked a noticeable difference in his direction, leaning more toward his inert dance influences. Changes in the bands line up also solidified a new direction for Slimmy, suggesting a more accessible approach from his earlier work. As a bonus track, "Anjo Como Tu" was included on the disc, his first and only recording done in his native language, Portuguese. As a result of the notoriety surrounding the song, it was chosen as a single and went on to become his biggest hit to date, going number one nationally. Presently, Slimmy is living in Portugal and performing in support of this latest release "Freestyle Heart".
Image.
Slimmy has been influenced by rock artists such as Placebo, IAMX and Kings of Leon. His vocals have drawn frequent comparison to those of Brian Molko and Caleb Followill, while the structure of his music is said to echo classic 1980s rock and 2000s electro. Slimmy's personal image, exploited with television appearances and a constant stream of videos has been considered extravagant and overworked, using rock imagery and fancy outfits to make a noticeable impression within the genre. This has also contributed to the widespread doubt as to his sexual orientation.
Awards.
Slimmy was nominated for the Portuguese Golden Globe Awards and also for the European Music Awards (MTV) in Best Portuguese Act.

John Elwes (politician)

John Elwes Meggot or Meggott (a.k.a. "Elwes the Miser"), MP (7 April 1714 – 26 November 1789) was a Member of Parliament (MP) in Great Britain for Berkshire (1772–1784) and a noted eccentric and miser, suggested to be an inspiration for the character of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol". Dickens made reference to Elwes some years later in his last novel, "Our Mutual Friend". Elwes was also believed to inspire William Harrison Ainsworth to create the character of John Scarfe in his novel "The Miser's Daughter".
Family background and early life.
Elwes (birth name "Meggot") was born on 7 April 1714 into a respectable English family. His father, Robert Meggot, was a respected Southwark brewer and his grandfather was Sir George Meggot, MP for that same borough. His mother, Amy (née Elwes), was the granddaughter of Sir Gervase Elwes, 1st Baronet and MP for Suffolk (see Elwes baronets).
His maternal grandmother, Lady Isabella Hervey (of the Earls of Bristol), happened to be a celebrated miser. He received a good education in the classics at Westminster School. After graduating he traveled to Geneva where he embraced his skill for horsemanship and love of the hunt. He was known as one of the best riders in Europe. It was at this time that he was introduced to Voltaire, to whom he was reported to bear a remarkable resemblance. However, Elwes was far more impressed with the quality of the horses at his riding school than by the genius of the French philosopher. 
First inheritance.
Elwes inherited his first fortune from his father who died in 1718 when he was just four years old. Although his mother was left £100,000 in the will (approx. £8,000,000 as of 2010) she reputedly starved herself to death because she was too mean to spend it. With her death, he inherited the family estate including Marcham Park at Marcham in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), purchased by his father in 1717.
Second inheritance.
The greatest influence on Elwes' life was his miserly uncle, Sir Harvey Elwes, 2nd Baronet, of Stoke College and MP for Sudbury, whom Elwes obsequiously imitated to gain favour. Sir Harvey prided himself on only spending little more than £110 on himself per annum. The two of them would spend the evening railing against other people's extravagances while they shared a single glass of wine. In 1751, in order to inherit his uncle's estate, he changed his name from Meggot to Elwes. Sir Harvey died on 18 September 1763, bequeathing his entire fortune to his nephew. The net worth of the estate was more than £250,000 (approx. £18,000,000 as of 2010), a figure that continued to grow despite Elwes' inept handling of his finances.
Miserliness.
On assuming his uncle's fortune, however, Elwes also assumed his uncle's miserly ways. He went to bed when darkness fell so as to save on candles. He began wearing only ragged clothes, including a beggar's cast-off wig he found in a hedge and wore for two weeks. His clothes were so dilapidated that many mistook him for a common street beggar, and would put a penny into his hand as they passed. To avoid paying for a coach he would walk in the rain, and then sit in wet clothes to save the cost of a fire to dry them. His house was full of expensive furniture but also moulding food. He would eat putrefied game before allowing new food to be bought. On one occasion it was said that he ate a moorhen that a rat had pulled from a river. Rather than spend the money for repairs he allowed his spacious country mansion to become uninhabitable. A near relative once stayed at his home in the country, but the bedroom was in such a poor state that the relative was awakened in the night by rain pouring on him from the roof. After searching in vain for a bell, the relative was forced to move his bed several times, until he found a place where he could remain dry. On remarking the circumstance to Elwes in the morning, the latter said: "Ay! I don't mind it myself... that is a nice corner in the rain!" His biographer, Edward Topham, who knew him well, recounts:
According to author, William Haig Miller, he even "complained bitterly of the birds robbing him of so much hay with which to build their nests."
Even Elwes' health was limited by expense. In common with many misers, he distrusted physicians, preferring to treat himself in order to save paying for one. He once badly cut both legs while walking home in the dark, but would only allow the apothecary to treat one, wagering his fee that the untreated limb would heal first. Elwes won by a fortnight and the doctor had to forfeit his fee. He also bore a wound from a hunting accident. Legend has it that one day he was out shooting with a gentleman who was a particularly bad shot. This same man accidentally fired through a hedge, lodging several shot in the miser's cheek. With great embarrassment and concern, the gentleman approached Elwes to apologize. But Elwes, anticipating the apology, held out his hand, and said: “My dear sir, I congratulate you on improving; I thought you would hit something in time.”
Political career.
In 1772 with the help of Lord Craven he became a Member of Parliament for Berkshire (his election expenses amounted to a mere eighteen pence). He entered the House of Commons in a by-election as a compromise candidate to replace Thomas Craven, which began the first of three terms. He held his seat unopposed until he stood down at the 1784 election. Elwes sat with either party according to his whim, and he never once rose to address the House of Commons. Fellow members mockingly observed that since he possessed only one suit, they could never accuse him of being a "turncoat". The post did, however, cause Elwes to frequently travel to London. This journey was accomplished on a poor lean horse, the route chosen being always the one whereby he could avoid turnpike tolls. He was known to put a hard-boiled egg in his pocket, and midway on his journey would sit under some hedge and eat his egg or sleep. After 12 years he retired rather than face the prospect of laying out any money to retain his seat.
Moneylending.
In the meantime, Elwes lost huge sums of money to his colleagues in unrepaid loans, uncollected debts and dubious investments. He believed that one did not ask a gentleman for money, regardless of the circumstances. On one notable occasion Elwes, unsolicited, lent Lord Abingdon £7,000 to enable him to place a bet at Newmarket. On the day of the race, Elwes rode on horseback from Suffolk to the racetrack with nothing to eat for fourteen hours save a piece of pancake which he had put into his pocket two months earlier and which he swore to a startled companion was “as good as new”.
Later years.
When his parliamentary career was over, Elwes devoted his full energies to being a miser as he moved about among his many properties. At his neglected estates he continued to forbid repairs, joined his tenants in postharvest gleaning, and sat with his servants in the kitchen to save the cost of a fire elsewhere. Even on the coldest day of winter he was known to sit fireless at his meals, saying that eating was "exercise enough" to keep him warm. If a stableboy put out hay for a visitor's horse, Elwes would sneak out and remove it. In his last years he had no fixed abode and frequently shifted his residence between his unrented London properties in the neighbourhood of Marylebone seeking out the ones which were temporarily unoccupied. A couple of beds, a couple of chairs, a table, and an "old woman" (housekeeper) were said to be all his furnishings. This same housekeeper was known to frequently catch colds because there were never any fires and often no glass in the windows.
This practice nearly cost Elwes his life when he fell desperately ill in one of these houses and no one could find him. Only by chance was he rescued. His nephew, Colonel Timms, who wanted to see him, inquired in vain at Elwes's banker's and at other places. A pot boy recollected having seen an "old beggar" go into a stable at one of Elwes's uninhabited houses in Great Marlborough Street and lock the door behind him. Timms knocked at the door, but when no one answered, sent for a blacksmith and had the lock forced. According to author Edward Walford in Volume 4 of his "Old and New London" (1878):
"In the lower part (of the house) all was shut and silent, but on ascending the stairs they heard the moans of a person seemingly in distress. They went to the chamber, and there on an old pallet bed they found Mr. Elwes, apparently in the agonies of death. For some time he seemed quite insensible."
He remained in this condition until some "cordials" could be administered by a neighbouring apothecary. After he had sufficiently recovered, Elwes stated that he believed he had been ill for "two or three days", and that there was an "old woman" in the house, but for some reason or other, she had "not been near him"; that she had "been ill herself", but that he supposed she must have "recovered" and "gone away". Upon searching the premises, however, Timms and the apothecary found the woman stretched lifeless on the floor, having apparently been dead for two days.
Towards the end of his life Elwes grew feverish and restless, hoarding small quantities of money in different places, continually visiting all the places of deposit to see that they were safe. He began suffering from delusion, fearing that he would die in poverty. In the night he was heard struggling with imaginary robbers, crying: "I will keep my money! I will! Don't rob me! Oh, don't!" When asked who was there?, Elwes would reply: "Sir, I beg your pardon, my name is Elwes, I have been unfortunate enough to be robbed in this house, which I believe is mine, of all the money I have in the world of five guineas and a half, and half a crown." The family doctor was sent for, and, looking at the dying miser, was heard to remark: "That man, with his original strength of constitution, and lifelong habits of temperance, might have lived twenty years longer, but for his continual anxiety about money." Even his barrister, who drew up his £800,000 will, was forced to undertake his writings in the firelight by the dying man's bedside in order to save the cost of a candle.
The famed miser was also known to sleep in the same worn garments he wore during the day. He was discovered one morning between the sheets with his tattered shoes on his feet, an old torn hat on his head, and a stick in his hand. It was in this condition he died on 26 November 1789. His burial took place in Stoke-by-Clare. After having lived on only £50 a year, Elwes left £500,000 (Approx £28,000,000 as of 2010) to his two sons who were born out of wedlock, George and John, (whom he loved but would not educate, believing that "putting things into people's heads is the sure way to take money out of their pockets") and the rest to his nephew.
The following summary of his character, by his friend and biographer, Mr. Topham:
"...his public character lives after him pure and without stain. In private life, he was chiefly an enemy to himself. To others, he lent much; to himself, he denied everything. But in the pursuit of his property, or in the recovery of it, I have it not in my remembrance one unkind thing that ever was done by him."
Besides being a member of Parliament, Elwes's accomplishments include financing the construction of a significant amount of Georgian London, including Portman Place, Portman Square, and parts of Oxford Circus Piccadilly, Baker Street and Marylebone.

Xylocleptes bispinus

Xylocleptes bispinus is a snout beetle from the subfamily of Scolytinae. It builds its nests in the bark of clematis shrubs.
Characteristics.
The beetles grow to a length of 2.3 to 2.4 millimetres and feature a cylindrical body. The notum is granular in the fore part and dotted in the rear section, whereby the "dots" are constituted by small hollows. Seen from above, the notum shields the insect's head. The males' elytra's onsets are emarginated. The rear parts of the males' elytra featura a sharp spike each, the female imago's elytra have a smooth furrow and a row of grains (sexual dimorphism). The antennae and final segments of the legs are yellow, the rest of the legs is auburn. The animal is otherwise coloured glossy brown and is hairy.
Proliferation.
The species can be found in southern, central and eastern Europe as well as in Denmark and Great Britain.
Life.
The bug settles on clematis vitalba and clematis orientalis, both being climbing shrubs. The larvae eat tunnels along the plant's stem, directly below the thin bark. The species is polygamous.
A pest control is not needed.

1957–58 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1957–58 campaign was a fairly mediocre season for the Terriers under Bill Shankly, who was taking charge for his first full season at Leeds Road. The season will be best remembered for the match against Charlton Athletic at The Valley on 21 December 1957. The match finished 7–6 to Charlton, after Charlton had only ten men for the majority of the match and the fact that with 27 minutes remaining, Town were leading 5–1 before losing the match. This remains the only match in professional football where a team has scored 6 goals and lost the match.
Review.
Bill Shankly's first full season in charge compromising a complete mixture of results, although Town did finish the season in 9th place with 44 points, although they were 12 points behind 2nd placed Blackburn Rovers. The season also saw Vic Metcalfe make his last appearance in a Town shirt in March in a match against Sheffield United.
The other main highlight of the season was the match at The Valley on 21 December 1957. The match against Charlton Athletic. The match finished 7–6 to Charlton, this after Charlton had only ten men for the majority of the match and the fact that with 27 minutes remaining, Town were leading 5–1 before losing the match. This remains the only match in professional football, where a team has scored 6 goals and lost the match.

Walter Kolbenhoff

Walter Kolbenhoff, born as Walter Hoffman (20 May 1908 - 29 January 1993), was a German novelist.
Biography.
Kolbenhoff was born in Berlin, the son of a workman. He became a worker himself and travelled as a vagabond throughout Europe, Turkey and northern Africa. In 1929 he joined the German communist party KPD living in Berlin, where he published his first novels in communist periodicals. 
The Hessischer Rundfunk produced a portrait of him in 1980, in which he spoke about his years in Berlin before Hitler came to power. He had to realize that the German communist party in the early 1930s was willing to help bring Hitler to power. Kolbenhoffs words about the KPD were: "Die wollte ja faktisch die Nazis an die Macht bringen um dann die Macht zu übernehmen." This was said very unambiguously in the periodical "Die Rote Fahne" of the KPD. It was told to Kolbenhoff and to his comrades, that Hitler would not remain in the government for long time and that a revolution of the working class in Germany would take place that would sweep him away and communist dictatorship would be the unavoidable consequence. Indeed in 1932 during a strike of the transport workers in Berlin the pickets were Rotfront (the communist party's organisation analogous to Hitler's SA) and SA-members side by side. These kind of actions by the German communists can only be explained by a direct order from Joseph Stalin. See also: social fascism and Wilhelm Hoegner.
In 1933 he left Germany for Denmark, where he stayed until 1940, with Wilhelm Reich. 1933 in Denmark appeared his novel "Untermenschen" (Undermen) in which he depicted his former life as a vagabond.
As German troops invaded Denmark in 1940 Kolbenhoff received orders from the communist party to go back to Germany and to join the Wehrmacht and to form a red cell. He obeyed, becoming a soldier and took part in the battles in Yugoslavia as well as Italy. In 1944 he was made a prisoner of war by the American troops in the ruins of the monastery at Monte Cassino. As a prisoner of war he got instructions in democratic governance in the USA and was released soon and came back to Berlin. In post war Germany he became a member of the famous Gruppe 47. He translated a lot of crime novels from English into German and wrote one himself about the man-hunt of the French Foreign Legion in Germany under chancellor Konrad Adenauer.
Kolbenhoff died in Germering on 29 January 1993.

Band of Heathens

The Band of Heathens are an American Rock and Roll band from Austin, Texas.
History.
The three original principal songwriters - Colin Brooks, Ed Jurdi and Gordy Quist - shared the bill at Momo's, an Austin club. Originally, each singer/songwriter performed his own set. However, they eventually started sharing the stage, and collaborating with bassist Seth Whitney. The Wednesday night series was billed as "The Good Time Supper Club". A misprint in a local paper billed the act as "The Heathens." Drummer John Chipman joined the band in 2007, and Keyboardist Trevor Nealon, who played in the studio during the recording of both "One Foot in the Ether" and "Top Hat Crown & the Clapmaster's Son", joined the touring unit in 2011.
Their first recording, "Live from Momo's", recorded at the now closed club on West 6th Street in Austin brought the band national attention and they were voted "Best New Band" at the 2007 Austin Music Awards. Following the Momo's release, the band released a second live recording, the CD/DVD "Live at Antone's" which was recorded at the venerable Austin club.
May 20, 2008 the band released their first, self titled, studio album. Produced by Ray Wylie Hubbard, and featuring notable guests Patty Griffin, Stephen Bruton, and Gurf Morlix, the record went to #1 on the Americana Music Association's radio charts. In November 2008 the Americana Music Association announced the Top 100 Albums of the Americana Charts for 2008 and The Band of Heathens came in at No. 8, thus referencing the Band Of Heathens Album as the 8th most played record on the Americana Airplay Charts for 2008.
In July 2009 BOH taped an Austin City Limits show that aired in the Fall of 2009. The year was especially significant for ACL in that Austin City Limits was celebrating its 35th anniversary year. The band's unique genesis and creativity were highlighted during the Austin City Limits interview conducted after their performance.
The TV performance showcased a set by both the Band Of Heathens and Elvis Costello.
Following the Austin City Limits PBS show, the band also played on the German television live concert series Rockpalast on October 9, 2009, performing 14 songs, many from the albums "Band Of Heathens" and "One Foot In The Ether.". 
"One Foot In The Ether", BOH's second studio release once again charted to the #1 slot on the Americana Radio Charts.
In 2009, the band was nominated for a "New Emerging Artist" award at the Americana Music Honors & Awards. In 2010, the band was again honored by the Americana Music Association as nominees for the "Best Duo/Group of the Year".
In 2011, the band released their fifth album overall (third studio album) "Top Hat Crown & the Clapmaster's Son". The album was listed in the top 10 most played Americana Albums of 2011, marking the third album in a row to make the year end top 10 list. This album is also the last studio project featuring founding member Colin Brooks, who announced in November of that year that he was leaving the band to pursue other interests after six years.
2013 provided the critically acclaimed album titled "Sunday Morning Record". The "Bakersfield Californian Review" aptly stated “Sunday Morning Record is a love letter to the past and, at the same time, a postcard to the future." 
The album charted to the number 2 spot on the Americana Charts Americana Music Association and was selected as the Number one album in 2013 by "The Alternative Root" 
Live Recordings.
The band started recording all of their live performances in February 2012 and making them available at the conclusion of each show on a USB drive. Each drive contains that night's audio recording, photos from the day of touring, and a video (when possible). Later, the band launched live.bandofheathens.com where the audio recordings are available either by subscription or a la carte download. Ed Jurdi said the band embraced the idea of sharing as much of their music as possible, "We play different set lists night to night and we’ll play songs differently over time and they will evolve. And that’s another outlet for fans to follow the band and explore what we are doing. So our attitude is to share it as much as we can.”
Discography.
The first two recordings were live - a live album at Momo's was recorded in 2006, and in 2007, "Live at Antone's" with a DVD/CD set was completed. In May 2008, the band released its first studio production simply titled "The Band of Heathens". Produced by Ray Wylie Hubbard, the album reached #1 on the Americana Charts and the EuroAmericana charts. What is significant however is that it was only the second independently released album to ever reach #1 on the Chart.
In September 2009 the band released the album "One Foot in the Ether" which again made it to number one on the Americana as well as the Euroamericana charts.

Francesco Nardelli

Francesco Romano Nardelli was born on 5 September 1953 in Rome, Italy, where he currently lives. He is an Italian naturalist who has dedicated his life to the protection and conservation of endangered species. He’s also the founder of the Sumatran Rhino Project, one of the most important coordinated efforts to save a critically endangered species.
In 1972, Nardelli established a private Wild Felids Breeding Center near Rome, where he successfully bred in captivity several threatened species including the Red-shanked Douc langur ("Pygathrix nemaeus"), the Snow leopard ("Uncia uncia"), the Clouded leopard ("Neofelis nebulosa") all first ever bred in Italy.
In 1980 he moved to England, where he became Curator of Howletts and Port Lympne Zoo, John Aspinall’s Zoos in Kent. There he was responsible for the setting up of new exhibits and directed with success several breeding programs including African elephant ("Loxodonta Africana"), (first ever bred in U.K.), Western lowland Gorilla ("Gorilla g. gorilla"), Siamang ("Symphalangus syndactylus"), Red-shanked Douc langur ("Pygathrix nemaeus") Surili langurs ("Presbytis sp".) Clouded leopard ("Neofelis nebulosa"), Snow leopard ("Uncia uncia").
In 1982 he conceived and directed the Sumatran Rhino Project [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=refs&CODE=note_detail&id=1165252955], the first international program for the conservation of the Sumatran Rhino ("Dicerorhinus sumatrensis"). That scheme was, and it still is, a collaborative effort involving – for the first time – national governments, local agencies, European and Asian conservation centers and international zoological institutions, to save this species from extinction. 
Under Nardelli's leadership, the Indonesian Government, Howletts and Port Lympne Zoo [http://www.totallywild.net], the Cincinnati, San Diego, New York and Los Angeles zoos, all played a crucial role in the success of the project. This plan is continuing under the leadership of the Department of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation of the Indonesian Government, assisted by the U.K. based Save the Rhino International, the U.S.A.’s International Rhino Foundation and other agencies.
The project resulted in the Indonesian government's signature of a rhino conservation agreement in 1985, the first time the Indonesian government has signed such an agreement and decided to participate in a coordinated international programme for the protection of an endangered species. The Sumatran Rhino has today a scattered population of around 300 individuals in the wild. Another legacy of the Sumatran Rhino Project is that several conservation agencies in Europe and North America, are committed to save these very few animals. 
Among other success stories related to this program is the birth in captivity of three calves of Sumatran Rhinos at the Cincinnati Zoo: on 13 September 2001. Andalas, a male, was the first of his species born in captivity since 1889 
. His mother, Emi, has since had two more calves in Cincinnati: a female, Suci, born in 2004 and a male, Harapan, born in 2007. "Ten years ago many people were skeptical claiming this species would never breed in a zoo. Yet today, the Cincinnati Zoo is world renowned for being the only place in the world this species is breeding successfully in captivity," said Dr.Terri Roth, Vice President of Conservation, Science and Living Collections at the Cincinnati Zoo. On April 29, 2007 Emi became the first Sumatran rhino in history to produce three calves in captivity, breaking her very own record. 
Nardelli's passionate commitment to the protection and conservation of Sumatran Rhinos inspired him to author “The Rhinoceros” (Basilisk Press, London) [http://siris-libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!380457!0#focus] a monograph featuring colored plates by renamed wildlife artist Matthew Hillier, describing the life and history of the five surviving species of rhinoceroses. 
In 1987 has co-founded the Yayasan Badak Indonesia (Indonesian Rhino Foundation), in Jakarta, a non profit organization for the long term conservation of rhinos in South-East Asia and is a Patron of Save the Rhino, since 2003. 
He regularly contributes articles to British, Italian, and Indonesian magazines and newspapers on the themes of conservation and protection of endangered species 
As an aquarium hobbyist, he is an accredited “Master of Layout”, by the Soto School of Zen in Kyoto [http://www.sotozen-net.or.jp/kokusai/sotozenschool.htm].This title enables him to realize special scenarios, emerged and submerged, following complex Zen principles. 
Today, Francesco Nardelli collaborates with Save the Rhino International on projects for the protection of the Indonesian rhinos and promotes several conservation projects in Italy and abroad. His work with wild mammals, in particular with the Sumatran Rhino, makes of Francesco Nardelli a respected naturalist and a reputable Italian conservationist.

Independent Socialist Party of Chad

Independent Socialist Party of Chad (, PSIT), initially called Independent Social Party of Chad, was a political party in Chad. PSIT was founded on September 21, 1950 at a General Assembly. The party statues were adopted on October 10, 1950, at another General Assembly with around 500 participants. André Labrouquère, a French socialist leader and free-mason, played a major role in the setting up of the PSIT.
The chairman of PSIT was Ahmed Koulamallah. Koulamallah had been the treasurer of the Democratic Union of Chad (UDT) but been expelled for financial mismanagement. Adoum Aganaye, a former leader of the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), was the first vice chairman of the party. Mohamed Akouna, Gabriel Yakité and Mohamed Talba were the other vice chairs of the party. Sékou Diarra, a former UDT and PPT member, became treasurer of the party. The leading committee of the party had two other members, Souleymane Naye (former PPT member) and Brahim Séid (CFTC organizer).
PSIT contested the 1951 election to the French National Assembly with Koulamallah and Aganaye as its candidates. The party was assigned the lion as its election symbol and green as its election colour. The list of the party obtained 13467 votes (8.19%), and didn't win any seat. The party got its best result in Salamat, where it obtained 6273 votes (60.33%).
In 1952 the party was part of a short-lived coalition with the Chadian Progressive Party, the Civic Action Front of Chad. Under Koulamallah's leader PSIT was divided into two in 1955. A group of expelled PSIT leaders, led by Ahmed Kotoko, formed a new PSIT. In 1956 Koulamallah founded a section of the African Socialist Movement, replacing his PSIT.
Support base.
The majority of PSIT militants were Muslims.

Ron Rivera (public health)

Ronald "Ron" Rivera (August 22, 1948 – September 3, 2008) was an American activist of Puerto Rican descent who is best known for promoting an inexpensive ceramic water filter developed in Guatemala by the chemist Fernando Mazariegos and used to treat gray water in impoverished communities and for establishing community-based factories to produce the filters around the world.
Early years.
Rivera was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, of Puerto Rican parents. He was raised in both New York City and Puerto Rico. Rivera graduated from The World University in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He also studied at the School for International Training.
Rivera worked with the Peace Corps in Panama and Ecuador, and with Catholic Relief Services in Bolivia. He founded the local consultancy office for the Inter American Foundation in Ecuador where he worked until 1988, when he moved to Nicaragua.
Career and work with ceramics.
Rivera first became passionate about ceramics in the early 1970s when he studied in Cuernavaca, Mexico with Paulo Freire and Ivan Illich, who taught that human beings had lost their connection with the earth. Rivera then went to live with an experienced potter and learned the art of ceramics.
After moving to Nicaragua in the late 1980s, where he reunited with and eventually married his high-school sweetheart, Kathy McBride, Rivera worked for over two decades with potters from rural communities in Nicaragua, helping them to enhance their production methods, including the implementation of a more fuel-efficient kiln developed by Manny Hernandez, a professor at Northern Illinois University. He also worked with potters around the country to develop new designs and to connect to new markets.

He first learned of ceramic pot filters from its inventor Guatemalan chemist Fernando Mazariegos. Rivera produced this inexpensive filter developed in Guatemala by Mr. Mazariegos from a mix of local terra-cotta clay and sawdust or other combustible materials, such as rice husks. The combustible ingredient, which has been milled and screened, burns out in the firing, leaving a network of fine pores. After firing, the filter is coated with colloidal silver. This combination of fine pore size and the bactericidal properties of colloidal silver produce an effective filter, killing over 98 percent of the contaminants that cause diarrhea, thus dramatically reducing public health problems in the communities that use them to purify potable water. He designed a mold for the filter and a special clay press that was operated with a tire jack.
The Family of the Americas Association, a Guatemalan organization, conducted a one year follow-up study on the initial Mazariegos-developed filter project, concluding that this filter helped to reduce the incidence of diarrhea in participating households by as much as 50 percent. Laboratory testing and field studies have been performed on the filter by various institutions, including MIT, Tulane University, University of Colorado and University of North Carolina.
Rivera began manufacturing the pots through Potters for Peace in Nicaragua, eventually helping to establish an independent enterprise to produce the filters.
Beginning in 1998, Rivera traveled throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia to establish 30 filter microenterprises in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Ghana, Nigeria, El Salvador, the Darfur region of Sudan, Myanmar and other countries. These factories have produced over 300,000 filters, and the filters are used by about 1.5 million people to date. An additional 13 filter workshops are scheduled to begin operating by the end of next year.
The filter has been cited by the United Nations’ Appropriate Technology Handbook, and tens of thousands of filters have been distributed worldwide by organizations such as International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF, Plan International, Project Concern International, International Development Enterprises, Oxfam and USAID.
Rivera wanted to share this guatemalan invention with the world and posted his experience in manufacturing ceramic pot filters in painstaking detail, on the Internet.
Written work.
Ron Rivera, Lynette Yetter, Jeff Rogers and Reid Harvey co-authored the paper, "A Sustainable Ceramic Water Filter for Household Purification," which Lynette Yetter presented at a NSF Conference in 2000.
Legacy.
Rivera’s filters were included in an exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum called "Design for the Other 90 Percent."
Rivera died in Managua, Nicaragua on September 3, 2008, after contracting falciparum malaria while working in Nigeria. A memorial service held in Managua on September 6 at the Universidad Centroamericana was attended by hundreds, including scores of local potters.

Motor cognition

The concept of motor cognition grasps the notion that cognition is embodied in action, and that the motor system participates in what is usually considered as mental processing, including those involved in social interaction. The fundamental unit of the motor cognition paradigm is action, defined as the movements produced to satisfy an intention towards a specific motor goal, or in reaction to a meaningful event in the physical and social environments. Motor cognition takes into account the preparation and production of actions, as well as the processes involved in recognizing, predicting, mimicking and understanding the behavior of other people. This paradigm has received a great deal of attention and empirical support in recents years from a variety of research domains including developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and social psychology.
Perception-action coupling.
The idea of a continuity between the different aspects of motor cognition is not new. In fact, this idea can be traced to the work of the American psychologist William James and more recently, American neurophysiologist and Nobel prize winner Roger Sperry. Sperry argued that the perception–action cycle is the fundamental logic of the nervous system. Perception and action processes are functionally intertwined: perception is a means to action and action is a means to perception. Indeed, the vertebrate brain has evolved for governing motor activity with the basic function to transform sensory patterns into patterns of motor coordination.
More recently, there is growing empirical evidence from cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive science, as well as social psychology which demonstrates that perception and action share common computational codes and underlying neural architectures. This evidence has been marshaled in the "common coding theory" put forward by Wolfgang Prinz and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. This theory claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate. Performing a movement leaves behind a bidirectional association between the motor pattern it has generated by and the sensory effects that it produces. Such an association can then be used backwards to retrieve a movement by anticipating its effects. These perception/action codes are also accessible during action observation.Other authors suggest a new notion of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic origin of action understanding that utilizes the motor system; motor cognition hypothesis. This states that motor cognition provides both human and nonhuman primates with a direct, prereflexive understanding of biological actions that match their own action catalog.
The discovery of mirror neurons in the ventral premotor and parietal cortices of the macaque monkey that fire both when it carries out a goal-directed action and when it observes the same action performed by another individual provides neurophysiological evidence for a direct matching between action perception and action production. An example of such coupling is the ease with which people can engage in speech repetition when asked to shadow words heard in earphones.
In humans, common neural activation during action observation and execution has been well documented. A variety of functional neuroimaging studies, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography, and magnetoencephalography have demonstrated that a motor resonance mechanism in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices occurs when participants observe or produce goal directed actions. Such a motor resonance system seems to be hard wired, or at least functional very early in life.
Shared representations between other and self.
The common coding theory also states that perception of an action should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar. As such, these representations may be shared between individuals. Indeed, the meaning of a given object, action, or social situation may be common to several people and activate corresponding distributed patterns of neural activity in their respective brains. There is an impressive number of behavioral and neurophysiological studies demonstrating that perception and action have a common neuronal coding and that this leads to shared representations between self and others, which can lead to host of phenomena such as emotional contagion, empathy, social facilitation, and understanding others minds.
Motor priming.
One consequence of the functional equivalence between perception and action is that watching an action performed by another person facilitates the later reproduction of that action in the observer. For instance, in one study, participants executed arm movements while observing either a robot or another human producing the same or qualitatively different arm movements. The results show that observing another human make incongruent movements interferes with movement execution but observing a robotic arm making incongruent movements does not.
Social facilitation.
The fact that the observation of action can prime a similar response in the observer, and that the degree to which the observed action facilitates a similar response in the observer cast some light into the phenomenon called social facilitation, first described by Robert Zajonc, which accounts for the demonstration that the presence of other people can affect individual performance. A number of studies have demonstrated that watching facial expression of emotions prompts the observer to resonate with the state of another individual, with the observer activating the motor representations and associated autonomic and somatic responses that stem from the observed target.
Motor cognition and mental state understanding.
Humans have a tendency to interpret the actions of others with respect to underlying mental states. One important question is whether the perception-action matching mechanism and its product, shared motor representations, can account (or to what extent it does) for the attribution of mental states to others (often dubbed theory of mind mechanism). Some authors have suggested that the shared representations network that stems from the perception-action matching mechanism may support mental state attribution via covert (i.e., non conscious) mental simulation. In contrast, some other scholars have argued that the mirror system and the theory of mind system are two distinct processes and it’s likely that the former cannot account for mental state understanding.
Reasoning.
A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance. A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently. These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls. Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts.

HM Prison Exeter

HM Prison Exeter is a local men's prison, located in Exeter in the county of Devon, England. The term 'local' means that this prison holds people on remand to the local courts. Exeter Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.
History.
In the reign of King Henry I (1100–1135) the manor of Bicton, near Exeter, was granted by the king to John "Janitor", who held the manor by the feudal tenure of grand serjeanty requiring him to provide a county jail, which was an honourable position of trust. The Latin noun "Janitor" means "door-keeper", generally understood in the sense "janitor carceris", "door-keeper of a jail". Thus the tenant took his surname from his form of tenure. The county prison was later transferred to a building beneath Exeter Castle in the county capital Exeter, but the feudal tenant of Bicton was nevertheless for many centuries required to meet part of the repair and maintenance costs of the newly sited jail. The Devon topographer John Swete (d.1821) stated that Dennis Rolle Esq. (d.1797), the proprietor of Bicton at the time of his visit, had paid the sum of £1,000 to the Treasury to be released in perpetuity from his vestigial feudal liabilities. The release was effected by an Act of Parliament in 1787, "Public Act, 27 George III, c. 59" summarised as:
"An Act for making and declaring the Gaol for the County of Devon, called the High Gaol, a Public and Common Gaol; and for discharging Denys Rolle and John Rolle Esquires, and their respective Heirs and Assigns, from the Office of Keeper of the said Gaol; and for improving and enlarging the same or building a new one; and also for taking down the Chapel in the Castle of Exeter; and for other Purposes therein mentioned".
The current Exeter prison was built in 1853, and is of a typical Victorian design, by local architect John Hayward. The prison was based on the plan of the model prison at Pentonville, with four residential wings. 
The prison has been the setting for many executions. Of particular note is the attempted execution of John Babbacombe Lee in February 1885. Three attempts were made to carry out his execution. All ended in failure as the trap door of the scaffold failed to open. This was despite the fact it had been carefully tested by James Berry, the executioner, beforehand. As a result, Home Secretary Sir William Harcourt commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Lee continued to petition successive Home Secretaries and was finally released from Exeter prison in 1907.
In August 1999 a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons severely criticised conditions at Exeter prison, with some inmates still having to slop out despite government claims that the practice had been eradicated from all jails three years previously. The report went on to state that Exeter Prison seemed to be "at the end of the line" and that industrial relations there bordered on anarchy.
A report issued by the Prison Reform Trust in May 2005 stated that Exeter was struggling with the result of overcrowding. The report criticised the lack of meaningful activities at the prison, resulting in inmates spending too much time locked in their cells. The report also noted, however, that Exeter Prison was among the best in the country at helping to rehabilitate offenders.
Exeter was highlighted again months later for its overcrowding by the Howard League for Penal Reform, who stated that the prison was running at 70% over capacity.
The prison today.
HMP Exeter accepts all male adults and young offenders committed to prison by the courts from Cornwall, Devon and West Somerset. 
The prison offers inmates employment in the kitchens, waste management, stores and domestic cleaning. Exeter also offers accredited training courses in education, computers, sports and leisure.

List of police firearms in the United Kingdom

Within the British Police, officers are not routinely armed. Instead, they rely on specially trained Authorised Firearms Officers (AFO), crewing Armed Response Vehicles to attend emergency calls where firearms might be needed. Specialist Firearms Officers are usually trained to a higher standard than an AFO, because they are likely to be the officers required to enter besieged premises. The vast majority of firearms used by the British Police are semi-automatic. Police use of force regarding firearms is dictated by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).
Standard weapons.
Firearms in service vary between police forces in the UK, due to individual Chief Constables and Police Authorities dictating the number of firearms officers and police firearms available to each force.
Firearms issued to Authorised Firearms Officers include:
Northern Ireland.
Unlike territorial police forces in Great Britain, the Police Service of Northern Ireland routinely arms all of its officers. Officers are issued the Glock 17 pistol, phasing out the now considered obsolete Ruger Speed Six revolvers previously issued. Previously long arms were routinely issued: either the Sterling submachine gun and later Heckler & Koch MP5, or rifles such as Heckler & Koch G3s, G36 K and C variants, or HK33s which replaced Ruger AC-556 select fire rifles. Long arms are still routinely carried in areas of higher threat such as North and West Belfast or various border areas.
Non-Home office police firearms.
Ministry of Defence.
Northern Ireland Security Guard Service.
Civilian Security Officers belonging to the Northern Ireland Security Guard Service who are attested as Special Constables carry the 9mm Browning pistol
Belfast Harbour Police.
A small, specialised Home Office approved force which bears responsibility for the Port of Belfast. Belfast Harbour Police officers have jurisdiction on all property owned by the Belfast Harbour Corporation and within a one-mile radius of this property. As a result of the threat from terrorism in Northern Ireland, Harbour Police officers carry Ruger 9mm revolver pistols, identical to those carried by the Royal Ulster Constabulary prior to 2001, at all times when on duty.
Belfast International Airport Constabulary.
Responsible for policing on the property of Belfast International Airport, officers of the Belfast International Airport Constabulary carry Ruger 9mm revolver pistols whilst on duty. Officers are also authorised to carry Heckler & Koch MP5 support weapons, similar to those used by the Police Service of Northern Ireland prior to the adoption of the Heckler & Koch G36.
Civil Nuclear Constabulary.
Unlike the majority of the British police territorial forces, Civil Nuclear Constabulary officers are routinely armed while carrying out duties. Civil Nuclear Constabulary officers also operate the armament on board the ships of the company Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited, which specialise in transporting spent nuclear fuel and reprocessed uranium on behalf of the British Nuclear Fuels organisation. Such ships have an on-board escort of armed police. The Civil Nuclear Constabulary use a range of heavier weapons up to automatic cannon of 30mm calibre deployed on the ships.

East Loch Tarbert, Argyll

East Loch Tarbert, Argyll is a small sea loch on the eastern side of the Kintyre peninsula in Scotland. It is a part of the much larger Loch Fyne. The village of Tarbert lies along the shores of the loch, which is separated from West Loch Tarbert by an isthmus only long.
According to Snorri Sturluson's "Heimskringla", Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, had his longship dragged across this isthmus as part of a campaign to increase his possessions in the Hebrides. He made an arrangement with King Malcolm III of Scotland that he could take possession of land on the west coast around which a ship could sail. Magnus declared that Kintyre had "better land than the best of the Hebrides", and by taking command of his ship's tiller and "sailing" across the isthmus he was able to claim the entire peninsula, which remained under Norse rule for more than a dozen years as a result.
More than two centuries later Robert the Bruce completed a similar feat during the Scottish Wars of Independence in order to impress the clan chieftains of Argyll. He used tree trunks as rollers.
In the 18th century Thomas Pennant recorded that sea-going vessels of up to were being hauled over the isthmus in order to avoid the dangers of storms and tidal races in the seas surrounding the Mull of Kintyre. James Watt surveyed the area and decided that it was feasible to construct a canal between the two lochs. Some 60 years later it was estimated that the cost for a cut without locks would be £90,000 but delays in implementation and the construction of the Crinan canal in 1801 rendered the plan redundant.
In the modern era the Tarbert (Loch Fyne) Harbour Commissioners control the loch, an area defined as "from the point of Garvell on the North, to the Oakenhead or Rudha Loigste point on the South". There are various quays and slipways in the inner harbour and 80 pontoon berths for yachts and other leisure craft.

Li Baozhen

Li Baozhen (李抱真) (733–794), né An Baozhen (安抱真), courtesy name Taixuan (太玄), formally the Prince of Yiyang (義陽王), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. He initially distinguished himself as deputy for his cousin Li Baoyu, and after Li Baoyu's death came into command of his own. He played substantial roles in fighting the rebellions during Emperor Dezong's reign against Zhu Tao, Wang Wujun, Tian Yue, and Li Na; and later in persuading Wang, Tian, and Li to again submit to Emperor Dezong.
Background.
An Baozhen was born in 733, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. He was probably the 10th-born son. His family was originally from Parthia
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
After Emperor Suzong died in 762 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong, Li Baoyu, who already had a command as a military governor ("Jiedushi"), was given the additional command of Zelu Circuit (澤潞, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), and it was said that he valued Li Baozhen's service under him. At one point, Li Baozhen was made the secretary general of Fen Prefecture (汾州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), when it appeared that the general Pugu Huai'en, who controlled the region and commanded the powerful army of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), was set on rebelling against Emperor Daizong. Li Baozhen slipped away in 764 and fled back to Chang'an. When Emperor Daizong asked him for his opinions on what to do with Pugu, Li Baozhen suggested that Emperor Daizong recommission the general Guo Ziyi, who was formerly Pugu's superior as the commander of the Shuofang army, arguing that such a move would undermine the morale of Pugu's army. Emperor Daizong agreed, and subsequently, Pugu did rebel but was unsuccessful. Emperor Daizong, crediting Li Baozhen for his opinions, made him the deputy military governor of both Zelu and Chenzheng (陳鄭, headquartered in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) Circuits, both of which were then under Li Baoyu's command. When Li Baozhen met Emperor Daizong to thank him, Li Baozhen, while thanking Emperor Daizong, stated, "Whether the people have to labor or can rest depends on their prefect. I would like to receive a prefecture to try myself." Emperor Daizong approved of his volunteering, and, in addition to making him the deputy military governor of Zelu and Chenzheng, also made him the prefect of Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi), one of the prefectures of Zelu Circuit. He served at Ze Prefecture for two years and then was moved to Huai Prefecture (懷州, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), which was merged into Zelu. He served there for eight years. At that time, as Li Baoyu was at Fengxiang (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) on the western border with Tufan, Li Baozhen was in effective command of Zelu.
Li Baozhen believed that, eventually, there would be war against a number of circuits commanded by generals who nominally submitted to Tang authority — Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), Lulong (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), Weibo (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Zhaoyi (昭義, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), and Shannan East (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), believed that Zelu was in a strategic position and was vulnerable to attack. In the aftermaths of the Anshi Rebellion, however, the circuit was lacking in military manpower, and had no financial resources to recruit soldiers. He thus created an innovative program — he selected the strongest of farmers and waived their tax burdens; in exchange, they were to train in archery, and the most capable ones would receive rewards. In three years, he was able to train them sufficiently that he was then able to convert them to an army of 20,000 men. It was said at the time that no other infantry in the realm could rival Zelu's. In 776, after Zhaoyi Circuit was largely seized by Tian Chengsi, the military governor of Weibo Circuit, after the death of its military governor Xue Song, and after the succeeding military governor of the portion of Zhaoyi that came under imperial control, Li Chengzhao (李承昭), fell ill, Li Baozhen was given the deputy military governorship of Zhaoyi as well, and Zhaoyi and Zelu were merged. In 777, after Li Baoyu died, Li Baozhen continued to be in command of the merged Zhaoyi Circuit, but still carried the title of deputy military governor.
During Emperor Dezong's reign.
Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. In 780, Emperor Dezong officially made Li Baozhen the military governor of Zhaoyi. In 781, when Emperor Dezong, wanting to reassert imperial authority, refused to allow Li Weiyue to succeed his father Li Baochen as the military governor of Chengde or Li Na to succeed his father Li Zhengji as the military governor of Pinglu, Li Weiyue, Li Na, and Tian Yue the military governor of Weibo rose together against imperial forces. As a part of their operations, Tian attacked Linming (臨洺, in modern Handan), then defended by the Zhaoyi general Zhang Pi (張伾). Li Baozhen sought aid from the imperial government, and Emperor Daizong sent the general Ma Sui the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) as well as a commanding general of the imperial Shence Army (神策軍), Li Sheng, to aid Li Baozhen. Together, Ma, Li Baozhen, and Li Sheng defeated Tian at Linming, forcing him to flee back to his headquarters at Wei Prefecture. In spring 782, they, along with Li Qiu (李艽) the military governor of Heyang Circuit (headquartered in modern Loyang) again defeated Tian (who was then aided by forces from Pinglu and Chengde as well) at Huan River (洹水, flowing through modern Handan). It was said that, in the aftermaths of the battle, Tian's subordinate Li Changshun (李長春) was ready to surrender Wei Prefecture to imperial forces, but as Ma and Li Baozhen did not get along with each other, their progressed was slowed, and only after 10 days after Tian was able to flee back to Wei Prefecture and kill Li Changchun did the imperial forces arrive at Wei Prefecture, and they were unable to capture it. (Ma and Li Baozhen's grudge against each other had originated when Ma was the defender of Heyang; at that time, there was an occasion when Li Baozhen wanted to kill his subordinate Yang Shu (楊鉥) the prefect of Huai Prefecture; Yang fled to Ma, who not only allowed him to take refuge but further submitted a petition to the emperor to defend Yang.)
Later in the year, when Li Weiyue's subordinate Wang Wujun rose against Li Weiyue and killed him, Wang briefly submitted to imperial authorities, but then rebelled when he was not made the military governor of Chengde as Emperor Dezong had implicitly promised. (Emperor Dezong had promised that whoever killed Li Weiyue would receive the positions that Li Weiyue wanted — but instead divided Chengde into three circuits, giving Wang the command of Hengji Circuit (恆冀, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang at the old Chengde headquarters in Heng Prefecture), containing only two prefectures of the seven Chengde prefectures, with the lesser title of military prefect (團練使, "Tuanlianshi"), while giving three prefectures to Zhang Xiaozhong, who was made military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) and two prefectures to Kang Rizhi (康日知) as the military prefect of Shenzhao Circuit (深趙, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang).) When Wang rose, he attacked Kang's position at Zhao Prefecture. The Ma-Li Baozhen dispute then almost nearly broke into the open when Li Baozhen sent part of his army to defend part of his territory, Xing Prefecture (邢州, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), which neighbored Zhao Prefecture; this displeased Ma, and Ma considered withdrawing altogether. Only at the moderation of Li Sheng did Ma and Li Baozhen make peace, and Ma's subsequent recommendation, Ming Prefecture (洺州, in modern Handan) was added to Zhaoyi. Subsequently, when Zhu Tao, the deputy military governor of Lulong — who had been loyal to imperial authority earlier but who had turned against the imperial government after not given any part of Chengde after Li Weiyue's death — came to Tian's aid along with Wang, the imperial forces suffered a major defeat. They had to take up defensive position and were no longer able to threaten Wei Prefecture. Subsequently, the four rebels declared themselves princes — Zhu declaring himself the Prince of Ji, Wang declaring himself the Prince of Zhao, Tian declaring himself the Prince of Wei, and Li Na declaring himself the Prince of Qi — effectively declaring independence, although they continued to use Tang's era name in order to show nominal allegiance. Soon, however, Zhu and Wang had a dispute over Zhu's actions in not returning quickly to Wei Prefecture after he briefly went back to his own circuit to fight off a surprise joint attack by Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun (張昇雲, Zhang Xiaozhong's son) — and Li Baozhen, hearing this, tried to exploit the situation by sending his subordinate Jia Lin (賈林) as a messenger to Wang, urging Wang to return to the imperial fold. Wang agreed to do so if Emperor Dezong would issue a general pardon to the rebels, but no pardon came at that time. Still, a secret relationship was created between Li Baozhen and Wang.
In fall 783, after not being given rewards after being summoned to Chang'an in anticipation of further service to the east, the army of Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) rebelled at Chang'an, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The Jingyuan army supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci, then at Chang'an, as emperor of a new state of Qin, and Qin forces subsequently put Emperor Dezong under siege at Fengtian. When this news reached the armies fighting the rebels in the east, the collective Tang forces in the east scattered, with Ma and Li Qiu returning to their circuits, Li Baozhen taking defensive position at Linming, and Li Huaiguang heading toward Chang'an, hoping to save Emperor Dezong. Subsequently, when Tian tried to persuade Wang and Zhu Tao's subordinate Ma Shi (馬寔) to attack Li Baozhen's position at Linming with him, Li Baozhen had Jia secretly persuade Wang that such a battle would not be to Wang's benefit — as if Linming fell, it would become part of Weibo territory, while a defeat would damage Hengji's army. Wang thus declined Tian's invitation and returned to Hengji. Subsequently, at Jia's further persuasion — pointing out that Zhu Tao's title of Prince of Ji showed an implicit ambition to take Wang's Ji Prefecture (冀州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) and that Zhu Tao was planning to involve Huige forces and attack south to join with Zhu Ci — Wang made a secret pact with Li Baozhen and Ma Sui to turn against Zhu Tao. Wang was further able to persuade Tian and LI Na to turn against Zhu Tao as well. In 784, when Wang, Tian, and Li Na publicly renounced their princely titles, Emperor Dezong, then still at Fengtian although no longer under siege by Zhu Ci, accepted Wang's, Tian's, and LI Na's pledge of allegiance and officially made them military governors again, while honoring Li Baozhen with an honorary chancellor title. Tian Yue was subsequently assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Tian Xu, who continued to be aligned with imperial forces. When Zhu Tao and Huige forces subsequently attacked Tian Xu, Li Baozhen and Wang arrived to aid him. It was said, however, that despite the pact, Li Baozhen's army and Wang's army still viewed each other as enemies due to their long-time rivalry, and the armies suspected each other. Li Baozhen, in order to show Wang his good faith, took only a few soldiers with him and went into Wang's camp to meet him, further showing his good faith by sleeping there. Wang, touched by Li Baozhen's display, stated, "My body has been promised to Brother Ten and will die for you." Together, they defeated Zhu Tao, forcing him to flee back to Lulong and end his campaign to take over the region. (Zhu Tao subsequently renounced his princely title as well and died shortly thereafter.) For Li Baozhen's contributions, Emperor Dezong created him the Duke of Ni, and then the Prince of Yiyang. After the end of the wars, early in Emperor Dezong's "Zhenyuan" era (785–805), Li Baozhen visited Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Dezong but returned to Zhaoyi thereafter. In 787, when Emperor Dezong tried to put him in charge of an operation to regain the western prefectures lost to Tufan, Li Baozhen declined. (The Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang attributed this to Li Baozhen being displeased that Emperor Dezong had, earlier in the year, relieved Li Sheng of his military command at the suggestion of the chancellor Zhang Yanshang.)
Meanwhile, it was said that Li Baozhen tried to gather talented people to his circuit by sending messengers throughout the realm to look for talented people and entice them with rewards, but that if those people thus retained had few suggestions for him, he would let them leave. As the realm was peaceful at the time, he constructed many pavilions and artificial lakes for his own amusement. He also engaged many alchemists in search of immortality. One of the alchemists that he engaged, Sun Jichang (孫季長), made golden pills for him and told him that consuming them would lead to immortality. Li Baozhen trusted Sun — so much so that he commented to his subordinates, "This is something that not even Qin Shi Huang or Emperor Wu of Han was able to have. I will soon be at the court of Shangdi and no longer be among you." As he then dreamed of riding on a flying crane, he made a wooden crane and practiced riding on it. Eventually, Li Baozhen took a total of 20,000 pills, and it was said that his belly became firm and he was unable to eat. A Taoist monk, Niu Dongxuan (牛洞玄), briefly cured him by giving him lard and laxatives. However, after Li Baozhen was healed, he again listened to Sun, who stated, "You have come close to immortality. Why abandon it now?" Li Baozhen thereafter took 3,000 more pills and died. Emperor Dezong mourned him for three days and gave him posthumous honors.
At the time that Li Baozhen was ill, his son Li Jian (李緘) plotted with Li Baozhen's subordinate Lu Huichang (盧會昌) and nephew Yuan Zhongjing (元仲經) for Li Jian to take over Zhaoyi. After Li Baozhen's death, Yuan acted as if Li Baozhen were still alive and forged an order from Li Baozhen transferring command to Li Jian. Initially, Li Baozhen's deputy Li Shuo (李說) and other subordinates agreed. Lu then forged a petition from Li Baozhen requesting Emperor Dezong to allow Li Jian to succeed Li Baozhen. Emperor Dezong, already hearing rumors that Li Baozhen had died, sent the eunuch Diwu Shoujin (第五守進) to Zhaoyi, ordering that the command be transferred to Li Baozhen's subordinate Wang Yan'gui (王延貴). When Li Jian considered resisting, the other officers would not go along with him, and he gave up the command and went to Luoyang per Emperor Dezong's orders.

1959 Air Charter Turkey crash

G-AGRH "Zephyr" was an Avro Super Trader IV cargo aircraft, which crashed on Mount Süphan in eastern Turkey on 23 April 1959. The Super Trader IV was a modified Avro Tudor IV, which had been fitted with an aft cargo door and was flown unpressurized.
Loss.
G-AGRH, owned by Air Charter Limited departed Ankara for a flight to Bahrain, which was a leg of a long cargo flight from United Kingdom to Woomera Airfield in Australia. The aircraft was carrying twelve men and top-secret equipment for Woomera rocket range. Between Ankara and Teheran, it used an air corridor, which would take it over the middle of Lake Van, Turkey's largest lake almost surrounded by mountains and situated close to the Soviet-Armenian border.
At 08:14, the aircraft passed over Gemerek at FL115 and Elazığ at 08:59 (at FL135). The last position report was received at 09:26 over Muş. The aircraft had crashed, and was found six days later on Mount Süphan, a little north of Lake Van.
A special Royal Air Force mountain rescue team of six men from Nicosia, Cyprus reached the crash site at the top of the mountain some days later and demolished the plane wreckage with several explosives after retrieving several important documents.
Causes.
It was concluded that the aircraft, which had been flying on instruments, drifted north of its normal track because of strong winds and crashed into the mountain. Contributing factors were that the winds were stronger than forecast - an accurate bearing could not be obtained at Muş, and the wind forecast at Van had not been checked. Sub-normal temperatures would result in a high indicated altimeter reading and calculations on the flight and contacts with beacons were not coordinated and controlled.

John Morrison, 2nd Viscount Dunrossil

Flight Lieutenant John William Morrison, 2nd Viscount Dunrossil CMG JP (22 May 1926 – 22 March 2000) was a British diplomat. Lord Dunrossil was British High Commissioner to Fiji, Nauru and Tuvalu and later to Barbados. His career reached its peak when he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda in 1983. While in South Africa he supported Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment by helping him gain a law degree from the University of London.
Early life and education.
Morrison was educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh before serving in the RAF between 1945 and 1948 and reaching the rank of Flight Lieutenant. Between 1948 and 1950 he read History at Oriel College, Oxford; his course being shorter than the usual three years due to the Second World War. He became President of the Conservative Association during his time at Oxford.
Career.
The early years of Morrison's diplomatic career were wide-ranging, including as Assistant Private Secretary to The Viscount Swinton and as First Secretary in Dacca, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). His career would go on to focus mainly on the Commonwealth countries. In February 1961, he inherited the viscountcy of Dunrossil from his father, William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil, who died in office as the Governor-General of Australia. 
Dunrossil was posted to South Africa, and was present during the trial of Nelson Mandela and his sentencing to 27 years' imprisonment. He subsequently obtained study materials for Mandela in order that he might achieve a law degree from the University of London.
His career reached its peak from 1978 onwards when he was appointed High Commissioner to Fiji, Nauru and Tuvalu. He then became High Commissioner to Barbados in 1982 before being appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda in 1983. His time in Bermuda was very successful mainly, as John Ure argues, due to his "genial temperament" and "social standing" meaning that he was able to settle the troubles of the region that had preceded his appointment. Lord Dunrossil was appointed a Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1981 for his diplomatic service.
After Bermuda.
Upon retirement in 1988, Lord Dunrossil took on several directorships and also played an active part as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords. He left the House in 1999 as he was not one of the elected hereditary peers allowed to remain in the Lords. Lord Dunrossil therefore devoted himself to spending time at Dunrossil House, his ancestral home in the Outer Hebrides, becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP). He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the Western Isles in 1993, holding this post until his death in Lanzarote in 2000.
Personal life.
Lord Dunrossil married twice, firstly to Mavis Dawn Spencer-Payne on 3 July 1951. The couple had three sons and one daughter, including his heir, Andrew William Reginald Morrison, who was born in 1953. He divorced his first wife in 1969 and remarried the same year to Diana Mary Cunliffe Vise who became Viscountess Dunrossil upon their marriage. The couple had two children.

New Energy Reform Act of 2008

The New Energy Reform Act of 2008 was offered by a bipartisan group of Senators in the 110th United States Congress in response to the energy policy gridlock between Republicans and Democrats. The proposal was offered as an alternative to an energy bill sponsored by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
House Republicans had attacked the Democratic plan for requiring that new offshore drilling take place at least 50 miles off the US Coast.
This compromise proposal differed from Pelosi's by moving the federally permitted drilling boundary to 100 miles offshore, with states given the option to set it at 50 miles. In what Washington Post calls "a key difference with Pelosi's bill" they would allow new drilling off Florida's west coast. Also unlike Pelosi's plan, the "Gang of 20" proposal allows for revenue sharing with the states.
Background and sponsors.
This compromise legislation was first proposed on August 1, 2008 by a bipartisan group calling themselves the "Gang of 10" as the "New Energy Reform Act of 2008" or "New Era". The group was founded by Senators Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) and Kent Conrad (D-ND) as the "Gang of 10", but ten additional members have since joined the coalition, creating a "Gang of 20". This nickname is in response to the 2006 Gang of 14, of which several members in the Gang of 10 were also a part. 
The original ten included five Republicans (Saxby Chambliss of Georgia (founding member), Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, and John Thune of South Dakota) and five Democrats (Kent Conrad of North Dakota (founding member), Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.) 
Ten additional members have since joined: five Republicans (Norm Coleman of Minnesota, Susan Collins of Maine, Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, John Sununu of New Hampshire, and John Warner of Virginia) and five Democrats (Evan Bayh of Indiana, Tom Carper of Delaware, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Ken Salazar of Colorado.)
The proposal.
The $84 billion New Energy Reform Act of 2008 calls for a focused effort to transition the nation’s motor vehicle fleets to fuels other than gasoline and diesel. To ease gas prices in the interim, the proposal includes significant conservation provisions, consumer tax credits, and responsible measures to increase domestic production.
The plan also would require cars to become more fuel efficient and would provide research funds for improved batteries to move away from petroleum-products in cars. The proposal calls for 85 percent of vehicles to run on non-petroleum-based fuel in 20 years.
The bill would open new areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Atlantic to oil and gas drilling, while raising taxes on the major oil companies. Oil companies would be allowed to drill outside of a 50-mile buffer zone off the beaches of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia — if those states agree. To pay for their proposal, the Gang of 10 would raise the major oil companies' taxes by excluding them from tax credits that apply to other manufacturers.
Reaction and criticism.
From Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) as reported by Fox News: "This proposal includes some very good ideas to address our country’s many energy-related challenges, and while I do not agree with every part of it, I very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed. ... I am hopeful this plan can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the Senate floor. The American people deserve a real debate with productive Senate action on bipartisan proposals to help make energy more abundant, secure and affordable for America’s families and businesses."
The response from Florida, however, has been mixed at best. "I compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis. Unfortunately, the proposal would eliminate Florida's 2006 Gulf protections and give Floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur," said Sen. Mel Martinez (R-FL). Martinez's Democratic colleague, Florida Senator Bill Nelson, has vowed to filibuster the proposal or any other legislation that would open the waters off Florida's western beach resorts.
Both Pelosi's proposal and this $84 billion compromise are strongly opposed by many Republicans, including John McCain, described in Sept 12's Guardian as "the plan's biggest opponent." McCain and many others consider the plan too expensive. Furthermore, McCain has made ending restrictions on offshore drilling a centerpiece of his election campaign. 
"I’d call it 40% tax increase, 10% energy and 50% snake oil" said Bob Schaffer (R-CO), 2008 Senate candidate. Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel explains, "Republicans like Mr. Schaffer had successfully turned this summer's political debate into a fight over domestic energy exploration, putting antidrilling Democrats on defense. Or at least that was the scene until the 'Gang'  – five Republicans and five Democrats  – announced a lackluster 'drilling' deal that may provide the left the cover it needs to defuse the energy issue."
Rush Limbaugh's voiced a similar objection: "And so, last Friday, in stumbled Sens. Lindsey Graham, John Thune, Saxby Chambliss, Bob Corker and Johnny Isakson — alongside five Senate Democrats. This 'Gang of 10' announced a 'sweeping' and 'bipartisan' energy plan to break Washington’s energy 'stalemate.' What they did was throw every vulnerable Democrat, and Mr. Obama, a life preserver."
Others questioned the motivation of the proposal's Republican sponsors. "The package could prove difficult to resist for Republicans in tight reelection races. Nearly every potentially vulnerable Senate Republican, from Coleman to Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and John Sununu of New Hampshire, has signed on to the legislation" according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Nine of the twenty sponsors (Pryor, Landrieu, Johnson, Chambliss, Collins, Coleman, Sununu, and Graham) are up for re-election this fall.
All 10 Republican co-sponsors had earlier pledged their allegiance to Grover Norquist and the Americans for Tax Reform, by signing his anti-tax pledge. Norquist says their participation in this effort violates the terms of that promise because the legislation would increase taxes on oil companies.

<doc id="19316605" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19316605" title="Non-photochemical quenching">
Non-photochemical quenching

Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a mechanism employed by plants and algae to protect themselves from the adverse effects of high light intensity. It involves the quenching of singlet excited state chlorophylls (Chl) via enhanced internal conversion to the ground state (non-radiative decay), thus harmlessly dissipating excess excitation energy as heat through molecular vibrations. NPQ occurs in almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes (algae and plants), and helps to regulate and protect photosynthesis in environments where light energy absorption exceeds the capacity for light utilization in photosynthesis.
Process.
When a molecule of chlorophyll absorbs light it is promoted from its ground state to its first singlet excited state. The excited state then has three main fates. Either the energy is; 1. passed to another chlorophyll molecule by Förster resonance energy transfer (in this way excitation is gradually passed to the photochemical reaction centers (photosystem I and photosystem II) where energy is used in photosynthesis (called photochemical quenching); or 2. the excited state can return to the ground state by emitting the energy as heat (called non-photochemical quenching); or 3. the excited state can return to the ground state by emitting a photon (fluorescence). 
In higher plants, the absorption of light continues to increase as light intensity increases, while the capacity for photosynthesis tends to saturate. Therefore there is the potential for the absorption of excess light energy by photosynthetic light harvesting systems. This excess excitation energy leads to an increase in the lifetime of singlet excited chlorophyll, increasing the chances of the formation of long-lived chlorophyll triplet states by inter-system crossing. Triplet chlorophyll is a potent photosensitiser of molecular oxygen forming singlet oxygen which can cause oxidative damage to the pigments, lipids and proteins of the photosynthetic thylakoid membrane. To counter this problem, one photoprotective mechanism is so-called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which relies upon the conversion and dissipation of the excess excitation energy into heat. NPQ involves conformational changes within the light harvesting proteins of photosystem II that bring about a change in pigment interactions causing the formation of energy traps. The conformational changes are stimulated by a combination of transmembrane proton gradient, the PsbS subunit of photosystem II and the enzymatic conversion of the carotenoid violaxanthin to zeaxanthin (the xanthophyll cycle).
"For further discussion, see Chlorophyll fluorescence and Plant stress measurement."
Measurement of NPQ.
Non-photochemical quenching is measured by the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and is distinguished from photochemical quenching by applying a bright light pulse to transiently saturate photochemical quenching thus removing its contribution from the observed quenching. Non-photochemical quenching is not affected if the pulse of light is short. During the pulse, the fluorescence reaches the level reached in the absence of any photochemical quenching, known as maximum fluorescence, formula_1.
"For further discussion, see Measuring chlorophyll fluorescence and Plant stress measurement."
Chlorophyll fluorescence can easily be measured with a chlorophyll fluorometer. Some fluorometers (such as the OS-5p) can calculate NPQ and photochemical quenching coefficients (including qP, qN, qE and NPQ), as well as light and dark adaptation parameters (including Fo, Fm, and Fv/Fm).

Albert Pissis

Albert Pissis (1852-1914) was the architect who introduced the Beaux-Arts architectural style to San Francisco, California, designing a number of important buildings in the city in the years before and after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
Biography.
Pissis was born on April 26, 1852 to French father and Mexican mother in Guaymas in the Mexican state of Sonora. His father, a physician, moved the family to San Francisco, California, in the United States, when Pissis was six. He was one of the first Americans to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. He returned in 1880 to San Francisco, which at the time was a fairly provincial western town despite its wealth, with buildings designed in a variety of architectural styles.
In 1882 Pissis became a member of the American Institute of Architects and, with partner William P. Moore, designed a number of buildings in flamboyant Queen Anne and Eastlake styles. However, by the 1890s he was a major figure in the Neoclassical (Classical Revival) movement, particularly Beaux-Arts, and introduced that style to San Francisco beginning with the Hibernia Bank building in 1892. Initially considered revolutionary, the style became popular among the city's powerful commercial and banking concerns. The dome he designed for the Emporium Department Store, now part of the Westfield San Francisco Centre, is often considered a "masterpiece".
Pissis played a major role in San Francisco's reconstruction following the Great Earthquake of 1906, both as a designer of a number of the city's landmark buildings, and as a member of the Committee of Fifty. He was also President of the local AIA chapter from 1907 to 1908.
Although popular and internationally known at the time, Pissis's approach to design was derided by later critics as reactionary, and blamed for suppressing more original architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan in favor of imitation of older European traditions. However, in more recent years his buildings have been increasingly praised.
Pissis died of pneumonia at age 62, in his suite at the St. Francis Hotel. He was survived by his widow, Georgia, who in 1920 sold land to Redwood City, California that became Sequoia High School.
Notable works.
Among the buildings Pissis designed are:

Christensen v. Harris County

Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000) is a Supreme Court of the United States case holding that a county's policy of requiring that employees schedule time off so that they do not accrue time off was not prohibited by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Facts.
Harris County Sheriff's department, in an attempt to reduce overtime expenditures, forced deputies to use accumulated compensatory time before they reached the limit which would require overtime payments. The petitioners argued that the Fair Labor Standards Act prohibited the forced use of "comp time." Respondents argued that the FLSA allows cashing out comp time and does not guarantee a minimum 40 hour work week.
The United States Department of Labor had issued an opinion letter stating that the forced use of comp time violated the act.
Judgment.
The Court held that an opinion letter from the Department of Labor stating that an employer had to first get the employee to agree before requiring the employee to schedule time off did not receive Chevron deference and instead should receive the less deferential standard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co. The majority attempted to draw a bright line between formal agency documents (e.g., legislative rules) and less formal ones (e.g., opinion letters). Therefore, the opinion letter of the Department of Labor was not binding on the court. The court went on to state that there is nothing in the FLSA that prohibited the forced use of comp time. Justice Thomas delivered the 6-3 decision of the court in favor of Respondent Harris County.
The case was argued on behalf of the United States by Matthew D. Roberts, for Petitioner by Michael T. Leibig and for Harris County, Texas by Michael P. Fleming.

Birch Mountain, or Paokrung (Northern Paiute for "Mountain of Stone"), is one of the fifty highest peaks of California. Of the major peaks of the Palisades, it stands furthest from the Sierra Crest. 
Judging by its few summit register entries, it is climbed far less than its nearby fourteener neighbors on the crest.
But its placement on the Sierra Peaks Section list adds to its appeal to peak baggers, and its low technical demand makes it a rewarding ski mountaineering destination.

Okay, Mother

Okay, Mother is an American daytime variety/game show hosted by Dennis James which originally aired on WABD in New York City in 1948. After receiving good ratings and largely positive reviews the show, originally titled "Mothers Inc.", aired nationally from 1 pm to 1:30 pm ET on the DuMont Television Network from Summer 1949 to July 6, 1951.
Premise.
The show was a "tribute to mothers" featuring a mix of interviews, game show segments, and viewer letters. The series was sponsored by Phillips' Milk of Magnesia Toothpaste and Bayer Aspirin. James often addressed the TV audience as "Mother", a practice he had begun when discussing the finer points of wrestling during his sports broadcasts. By addressing the TV audience this way, James avoided insulting sports fans at home or elsewhere about their knowledge of sports.
Episode status.
One DuMont episode survives and is available on the Internet Archive, with "honor mother" Judith Doniger Lipsey (1912–2007) mentioning her upcoming New York City recital on October 12. A contemporary "New York Times" article dates her appearance on "Okay, Mother" to July 18, 1950.
Clips of this episode were shown during the 2008 special "Pioneers Of Television: Game Shows", the first-season finale of PBS' miniseries.

War Memorial Park, Singapore

War Memorial Park is a parkland in Singapore, located along Beach Road in the Downtown Core of Singapore's Central Region. The Civilian War Memorial is located at the center of the park as a memorial to civilians who died in Singapore during World War II. It is managed by the National Parks Board.
Park.
The 1.4-hectare park has open lawns with "Gnetum gnemon" (Melinjau) trees covering the walkway leading up to the memorial from the four corners of the park. A pond is located around the memorial. The park with the Civilian War Memorial is a popular sightseeing venue.
History.
During the Sook Ching massacre that occurred in Singapore during World War II, mass war graves were dug to contain the bodies of civilians who were killed by the Japanese. When the bodies were unearthed in 1962 in various places, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) decided to gather the remains and create a memorial for them. The then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew set aside a plot of land at Beach Road for the building of the memorial and the War Memorial Park was created.
On 15 June 1963, in a monumental ceremony attended by VIPs, inter-religious organisations, community leaders and many others, the then Prime Minister officiated at the launch of the Civilian War Memorial project ceremony. The project was completed and the monument was unveiled on 15 February 1967 in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore.
Civilian War Memorial.
The monument was named the Civilian War Memorial but was affectionately known as the "Chopsticks" memorial with reference to its design. With four pillars each with a height of about 67 metres, the monument resembles two pairs of chopsticks. The design of the four pillars bears a significant meaning - they symbolise the four main races of people living in Singapore. Words were inscribed on the base of the memorial. In four languages, English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, the words read: "Memorial to the Civilian Victims of the Japanese Occupation 1942-1945".

Blessed by Fire

Blessed by Fire () (2005) is an Argentine film about the Falklands War written and directed by Tristán Bauer. The film features Gastón Pauls, Pablo Ribba, César Albarracín and Hugo Carrizo among others. It is based on a book written by a veteran of the war.
The film was nominated for 22 awards and won 14 of them.
Plot.
A powerful Argentine anti-war film in the tradition of American Vietnam war films such as "Full Metal Jacket" and "Coming Home", "Blessed By Fire" is the story of two young men who were sent to fight the 1982 war in the Falkland Islands (or as they are known in Argentina, Las Malvinas) and who return home bearing the brutal scars of war.
Twenty years after the war's end, journalist Esteban Leguizamón (Gastón Pauls) is informed that Alberto Vargas (Pablo Ribba), one of the men he served with, has attempted suicide after suffering from years of depression brought on by his experiences in the war. Esteban visits the comatose Vargas at the hospital, and in a series of extended flashbacks, revisits the scene of Argentina's "unwinnable war."
The film depicts Esteban and fellow soldiers Vargas (Pablo Ribba, the man in the coma) and Juan (Cesar Albarracin), who are living in foxholes on the remote, windswept Falklands, battling hunger, boredom, abuse, and the deprivations of war as they await the arrival of British forces. A series of harrowing battle scenes with British forces ensues, and the Argentines realise the futility and violence of their mission. They are cannon fodder, pawns in a futile political game.
Back in the present, Esteban returns to the Falklands to come to terms with himself and the past. The emotional final scenes were shot on location in the Falklands, for the first time in Argentine film. As Esteban looks over the still off-limits battlefields filled with mines, live ammunition, and rusting military equipment, the futility of war is abundantly clear.
Release.
The film was shown on the Australian TV channel SBS on March 17, 2009.

Metal Storm (webzine)

Metal Storm (also known as MetalStorm.net, MetalStorm.ee, MetalStorm.eu or just MS) is a webzine specializing in various forms of heavy metal music. It is based in Tallinn, Estonia but caters to an international audience, symbolically recognized by the acquisition of an EU domain in 2008. As of June 2013, the website hosts 7,812 band profiles, 7,800 reviews, 553 interviews and 16,753 news items.
Community.
Members.
Metal Storm users can register for free and create a custom profile based on their specific preferences. The comprehensive profile format allows for users to display detailed information about their musical taste, activity on the site, and other miscellaneous information, including up to three photos. "Community Points" are awarded to users for contributing forum reports, band info, lyrics, news, events, reviews, and articles, with the number awarded depending on the value of the contribution. Users may also add albums to their "Collection," an interactive list of albums acquired, of which statistics can be graphically visualized in the form of pie charts broken down by style and country. These lists, along with the favorite bands and ratings categories, are analyzed to compare users and match those with similar musical tastes in the "Neighbours" area of the "Collection" tab.
Forum.
Metal Storm has a forum available to all registered members. The forum is divided into many categories, including sections for discussing specific metal styles, non-metal music, general discussion and community-related topics. All comments for publications on the site are also incorporated into the forum for the purpose of convenience. The forums are moderated for spam and illegal content such as pornography and copyright infringement but are otherwise uncensored.
Tradelist.
In each member's Collection section, they have the option of making the album part of their regular collection, their wishlist or part of their tradelist. Members can then browse other member's tradelists and privately negotiate the trade of albums. Metal Storm states that the trading of albums is to be done at the member's own risk and that the site won't be responsible for any outcomes.
Bands database.
Metal Storm features a database of metal bands, with each band having a detailed profile including such information as a biography, discography, lineup, genre categorization, photo, logo and more. All registered members are able to edit the database and submit information that is missing. Before being published, community edits are moderated by members of the staff.
Genre categorization.
Metal is divided into three broad sub-categories on Metal Storm. Bands that fall in between two sub-categories are usually allocated based on what elements are historically more prominent in their music.
This sub-category includes metal subgenres such as heavy metal, power metal, progressive metal, glam metal, doom metal, Gothenburg, gothic metal, folk metal, speed metal and symphonic metal.
This sub-category includes metal subgenres such as black metal, death metal, grindcore, thrash metal, and groove metal. Extreme doom metal bands are also included in this sub-category.
This sub-category includes metal subgenres such as alternative metal, nu metal, metalcore, stoner metal, sludge metal, post-metal, rap metal, industrial metal, avant-garde metal and drone metal.
Accepted content.
Metal Storm is known for its relatively relaxed attitude towards accepting bands that are not unquestionably categorized as metal. The database allows for 'invisible' profiles, which is a term used for profiles that are either incomplete or of bands that do not have enough metal elements to have them featured on the site. These profiles are still publicly accessible; however, they are not promoted as much as those of bands that are unquestionably metal. Nevertheless, Metal Storm still has visible profiles for stylistically ambiguous bands such as Slipknot, Candiria and Led Zeppelin. Moreover, there are many reviews of stylistically ambiguous bands on the site, most commonly from the genres of gothic rock, noise rock, industrial music, hard rock, progressive rock, AOR and darkwave. This attitude is rationalized as being an attempt at promoting open mindedness amongst metal fans.
Rating system and reviews.
Members have the option to rate featured albums on a scale of 1-10, with the total votes from all members producing an average rating. Further statistics that can be viewed include average ratings based on voter gender and age. Studio albums with over 200 votes are eligible to be included in the "Top 200 albums" list, while others that accumulate 20 votes are eligible for more specific lists including "Top 20 albums by year", "Top albums by style", and "Bottom albums" (The lowest-on-average user rated albums). Live albums and DVDs are also eligible for their respective lists after receiving 20 votes.
Metal Storm has a team of official reviewers who receive albums from labels and bands and then post official reviews of them on the front page of the website. Nevertheless, all registered users are able to submit reviews of albums, provided that they are of music that has been released for at least 3 months. If accepted by the editors, these reviews are then posted as "Guest Reviews" with an appropriate disclaimer attached to them.
An event is considered a "Supported Event" by Metal Storm if the organizers allow for Press Accreditation for an official reviewer from the website. The event then receives an official review with photographs. Like album reviews, concert reviews are also accepted from users; however, such events are not considered Supported Events.
In 2008 MetalStorm became one of the official partners of the French festival HellFest and a number of the interviews conducted by MS staff on the festival will feature on the upcoming HellFest DVD. The partnership is continued in 2009.
Interviews.
Metal Storm regularly posts interviews with various metal bands through its contacts with bands, labels and festivals. They conduct interviews via email, over the phone and in person. Each interview is transcribed and posted as text on the site. As of September 2008, Metal Storm started video recording some in-person interviews. The videos would be uploaded to YouTube and embedded in the interview's page on Metal Storm. The first of these was an interview with Attila Csihar of Norwegian black metal band Mayhem and was conducted at the Hellfest Open Air 2008 festival.
Metal Storm Awards.
Metal Storm hosts an annual award, where they appoint the album of the year for the different genres of metal. The official 10 nominees of each category are decided by the staff members and receives a brief description and if available a link to an official MetalStorm review. In additions to the official nominees, the users have the opportunity to supply "write-in" votes for bands not officially nominated.
There is also a special award each year called "Best drama." It's given to the band, who is considered to have provided a good drama the year in question. The drama award is generally only in sarcasm and not considered a "serious award". In 2007, the award was given to Gorgoroth for the fight over the rights to the name Gorgoroth. In 2008, the award for best drama went to "Metal Storm vs. Wikipedia," or, as the nomination reworded it, the conflict between "the staff of Metal Storm and the uberposeurs of Wikipedia." This revolved around the "drama" with the conflict about Metal Storm's Wikipedia page reaching Wikipedia's standards of notability. It was the first year that this award has been able to be voted for by Metal Storm users, with various dramas listed as nominees. In the past the Metal Storm staff have just chosen the drama award themselves.
Every year Metal Storm contacts all the bands nominated for awards in each category and a lot of bands post their nomination and award wins as news on their official websites. Regarding the 2008 awards, news of Oceans of Sadness' victory in the avant-garde metal category was printed in the Belgian/Flemish newspaper "Gazet Van Antwerpen." The online version of the newspaper also published it. The Metal Storm Awards in 2008 was the fourth year that the awards have been running.

<doc id="19316823" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19316823" title="Abraham Barak Salem">
Abraham Barak Salem

Abraham Barak Salem (1882–1967) was an Indian nationalist and Zionist, a lawyer and politician, and one of the most prominent Cochin Jews of the twentieth century. A descendant of "meshuchrarim," he was the first to graduate from college, and the first Cochin Jew to become an attorney. He practised in Ernakulam, where he eventually used q"satyagraha" to fight the discrimination among Jews against his people. An activist in the trade union and Indian national causes, he later was attracted to Zionism. After visiting Palestine in the 1930s, he later helped arrange the migration of most Cochin Jews to Israel by 1955. He stayed in Kochi for the remainder of his life.
Early life.
Salem was born in 1882 to a Jewish family in Cochin (now Kochi), then a small princely state in British India and now part of the Indian state of Kerala. His family were regarded as"meshuchrarim", a Hebrew word used, sometimes neutrally and sometimes with derogatory intent, to denote a manumitted slave or her descendants. The Paradesi Jews of Cochin had arrived there since the 16th-century following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. They discriminated against the "meshuchrarim" in their community who were relegated to a subordinate position in the Paradesi Synagogue in Cochin. Given the cultural differences between them, the Paradesi (or "White") Jews and the older communities of Malabari Jews also maintained ethnic distinctions for centuries, which became associated historically with differences in skin colour. 
Brought up by his mother, Salem attended the Maharaja's College in Ernakulam. He moved to Chennai to earn his Bachelor of Arts degree, becoming the first university graduate among the "meshuchrarim". Whilst in Chennai he also earned his law degree, the first Jew from Cochin to do so, before returning to practise as a lawyer in the Cochin Chief Court in Ernakulam.
Activism.
The Malabari Jews had seven places of worship; the White Jews had one, the Paradesi Synagogue, which for centuries had been barred to those whom they considered impure. The contemporary historian Edna Fernandes calls it "a bastion of white purity". The White Jews practised endogamous marriage, which excluded both the "meshuchrarim" and Malabari Jews (who also practised endogamy that excluded theother groups). The "meshuchrarim" had to sit in the back of the synagogue or outside. The separation resembled Indian discrimination against lower castes, which was sometimes repeated in Christian churches in India. 
Salem fought against this discrimination by boycotting the synagogue for a time. He used "satyagraha" (or non-violent protest) as a means of combating discrimination within the community. This led some people to later refer to him as the "Jewish Gandhi". By the mid-1930s, Mandelbaum reported that many of the old taboos had fallen, reflecting wider changes in Indian society as well.
Salem served in the Legislative Council in the princely state of Cochin from 1925 to 1931 and again from 1939 to 1945. A supporter of the nascent trade union movement in Kerala and an active Indian nationalist, at the end of 1929 he attended the Lahore session of the Indian National Congress. It passed a resolution calling for complete independence from the Raj. 
After visiting Palestine in 1933, Salem was attracted to the Zionist cause. After Indian independence, he worked to promote aliyah to Israel among the Cochin Jews. In 1953, he visited Israel to negotiate on behalf of Indian Jews who wanted to migrate. This also helped to diminish the divisions among the Cochin Jews. After emigration they were all considered foreigners to Israel, and many struggled to assimilate.
Although most of Cochin's ancient Jewish community eventually left for Israel by 1955 (and, in the case of many White Jews, for North America and England), Salem lived in Cochin until his death in 1967. He was buried in the White Jewish cemetery in Jew Town in Cochin.

West Loch Tarbert, Argyll

West Loch Tarbert, Argyll is a long and narrow sea loch on the western side of the Kintyre peninsula in Scotland.
Geography.
The head of the loch lies near the village of Tarbert and it reaches the open sea at Ardpatrick Point some distant.
The island of Eilean Ceann na Creige, off the south shore, is connected to the mainland by a causeway. It is the ferry terminal for Islay.
History.
Around the year 1093, Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway had his longship dragged across the isthmus at Tarbert between West Loch Tarbert and East Loch Tarbert as part of a campaign to increase his possessions in the Hebrides. He made an arrangement with King Malcolm III of Scotland that he could take possession of land on the west coast around which a ship could sail. Magnus declared that Kintyre had "better land than the best of the Hebrides", and by taking command of his ship's tiller and "sailing" across the isthmus he was able to claim the entire peninsula, which remained under Norse rule for more than a dozen years as a result.
Ferry services.
In the 1960s, Western Ferries began operating a car ferry, with a simple stern-loading ramp, from Kennacraig on the south shore. This served Port Askaig on Islay, in competition with the mail steamer, operated by MacBraynes from West Tarbert near the head of the loch. The new service soon won a significant share of the traffic and stimulated MacBraynes to modernise the Islay route. In January 1970, hoist-loading MV "Arran" was transferred from the Clyde. She gave two daily return sailings, one each to Port Ellen and Port Askaig, as well as sailings to Craighouse on Jura, Gigha and Colonsay. Over the winter 1972/73, "Arran's" hoist and side-ramps were removed, along with the superstructure aft of them. She was converted to a stern-loading vessel, with a stern ramp and an open car deck. In this guise, she took on a new timetable – three double crossings a day between modified at terminals at Port Ellen and West Loch Tarbert. Port Askaig was left to Western Ferries.
With the introduced of MV "Pioneer" in August 1974, CalMac started to win back Islay traffic. Over the next five years "Pioneer" became well established, running to Port Ellen and Gigha. In 1978, Caledonian MacBrayne took over the Western Ferries terminal at Kennacraig, with the deeper-draught MV "Iona", again providing a service to both Port Ellen and Port Askaig, as well as calling at Gigha. In 1989, the more spacious, MV "Claymore" became the Islay ship, with the drive-through MV "Isle of Arran" taking over in 1993. Since 2001 MV "Hebridean Isles" has been the main Islay vessel.

Madhyamavati

Madhyamavati (madhyamāvati) is a rāga in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is an "audava" rāga (or "owdava" rāga, meaning pentatonic scale). It is a "janya" rāga (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven musical notes ("swaras"). The equivalent of "Madhyamavati" in Hindustani music is "Madhumad Sarang".
It is considered a very auspicious rāgam and every Carnatic music concert ends with either a song in "Madhyamavati" or the ending of the last song is sung in this rāgam. It is very suitable for elaboration and exploration due to even spacing of notes. The scale uses the first three notes of the cycle of fifths "S, P and R2" and fourths "S, M1 and N2".
Structure and Lakshana.
"Madhyamavati" is a symmetric rāgam that does not contain "gāndhāram" or "dhaivatam". It is a pentatonic scale ("audava-audava" rāgam in Carnatic music classification - audava meaning 'of 5'). Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
This scale uses the notes "chatushruti rishabham, shuddha madhyamam, panchamam" and "kaisiki nishadam". "Madhyamavati" is considered a "janya" rāgam of "Kharaharapriya", the 22nd Melakarta rāgam, though it can be derived from other melakarta rāgams, "Charukesi", "Natabhairavi" or "Harikambhoji", by dropping both "gāndhāram" and "dhaivatam".
Popular compositions.
"Madhyamavati" rāgam lends itself for extensive elaboration and exploration and has many compositions. Here are some popular "kritis" composed in this scale.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Graha bhedam".
"Madhyamavati's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 4 other major pentatonic rāgams, namely, "Mohanam", "Hindolam", "Shuddha Saveri" and "Udayaravichandrika" (also known as "Shuddha Dhanyasi"). "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For more details and illustration of this concept refer "Graha bhedam on Mohanam".

<doc id="19316938" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19316938" title="South African American">
South African American

South African Americans are Americans who have emigrated from South Africa. There are 45,569 people today in the United States who claim South African ancestry. The majority are White South African, most of them being of European ancestry.
History.
Free South Africans began arriving in the United States as early as the late 19th century. The first groups were South African (Afrikaner) miners who arrived in California. Many South Africans, typically of European Anglo-Saxon heritage, came in the mid-20th Century. Immigration by Negroids was limited; though the standard of living for individuals of dark complexion in South Africa was higher than for most people living on the African continent. Political and economic conditions still made immigration difficult, as Negroids were forced to escape to other African nations before they could emigrate to the country of their choice. Following the Soweto student uprising in 1976, there was a significant increase in South African emigration to the United States. Many of these immigrants were South African Jews who formed a community in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Although emigration policies during apartheid made immigration difficult, there were a small number of black students and political refugees who emigrated to the United States. During the 1980s and 1990s many South Africans entered the United States for political reasons, to be with family members, or to access professional opportunities not available in their home country. The largest wave of South African immigration was in 1994, after the election of Nelson Mandela as president. Many white South Africans, especially Afrikaners, emigrated out of fear because they were unsure of the changes that would come about by the acquisition of political power in the black population.
The ending of apartheid brought significant waves of pale skinned immigrants. This time, white South African settlers also included most of British descent with a significant number of Portuguese heritage.
Demography.
Although the majority of South Africans who emigrated went to Australia and New Zealand, countries with similar cultural and linguistic heritages, as well as similar climates. There were also a large number of South African immigrants that went to the United States. Many white South Africans, both before and after the end of apartheid, emigrated to Midwestern states such as Minnesota and Illinois. Atlanta, Georgia, has a large population of South African Jews. Also, a number of South Africans live in New York and Mid-Atlantic states such as Maryland. Most South African immigrants in the United States are white people of European origin. So, of 82,000 South African that were living in this country between 2008-09, only 11,000 them were of Black skin. 
The majority of these immigrants are English speaking, with a moderate proportion of these being South African Jews. Of the 45,569 South African Americans reported in the 2000 census, 509 people were specified his ethnic origin as Zulu. In the United States, South Africans in general—both white and black—live in the United States individually, rather than in communities of South African Americans. Most South Africans in the United States are currently settled in San Diego, CA, approximately 20,000 people. Although they are elsewhere in the western United States including the Pacific Northwest, these cities lack significant numbers of South African Americans.
Organizations.
Indaba ("discussion" in Zulu) is an example of an organization set up by South Africans to promote community involvement. It was founded in the 1990s and sponsors community events and activities. In addition, this organization allows the exchange of information through a web site and a mailing list, keeping South Africans informed about international and local events. The South African consulate in Chicago has close ties with many expatriates and hosts regular events with speakers, including an annual celebration of Freedom Day on 27 April. In 2001, the hosts founded the African Group of the U.S. Women's Action to boost the knowledge and understanding of South Africa among Americans. The South Africans are also in many other forums, such as informal parties, religious activities and rugby matches.

All visitors must hold a passport valid for 1 month.
Short stays in Macau.

Bangladeshi, Nepalese, Nigerian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Vietnamese citizens cannot obtain a visa on arrival in Macau and must apply for one in advance at a Chinese embassy or consulate, unless they hold a Hong Kong identity card or are consular staff stationed in China.
Alternatively, at the border checkpoint when entering Macau one can apply for an Autorização de Entrada (in effect a "visa on arrival" or a type of entry clearance). The holder of an Autorização de Entrada can only stay for a maximum of 30 days in Macau, within which the holder can make multiple visits to Macau without restriction. The cost for an Autorização de Entrada is MOP100 for an adult passport, MOP200 for a family passport, MOP50 for children under 12 possessing their own travel document and MOP50 for those showing proof that they are travelling as part of a large group.
Border officers may ask visa applicants to show proof of funds (HK$5000 or equivalent), a valid return air ticket to the country of origin (or out of Hong Kong/China/Macau), a valid return ticket out of Macau (ferry ticket, if entered that way), and evidence of a local hotel booking in Macau, to be able to apply for a visa on arrival.
Under Macau law, border inspection personnel/Serviço de Migração staff are able to deny a visa application if:
Extending short stays in Macau.
Visitors who have entered with short stay status can extend their leave to enter, should their travel plans change, by either 30 days or 1 year. This can be done by applying at the local Serviço de Migração office.

Mainland Chinese visitors (i.e. non-residents) who lose their travel documents, or have them stolen, whilst in Macao must first report to the Serviço de Migração office, where they will be issued with a special departure travel document free of charge enabling them to leave Macao.
All other visitors (i.e. non-residents) who lose their travel documents, or have them stolen, whilst in Macao must first report to a police station. After obtaining a police report, they should visit the Serviço de Migração office, where they will be issued with a special departure travel document free of charge enabling them to leave Macao.
Long stays.
Study visas.
Students from Mainland China in possession of a valid travel permit issued by the Mainland authorities with an observation stating that they can remain in Macau for 365 days are allowed, under Macanese law, to remain for a maximum period of 90 days in Macau. Therefore, if the student wants to extend the stay of 90 days to 365 days, he/she has to go to the local Serviço de Migração office to apply for a study visa (Chinese:逗留的特別許可), which is valid until the observation expires. 
Hong Kong students need not apply for a study visa, as they are entitled to enter Macau with their Hong Kong permanent identity card for a maximum of one year.
Overseas students can apply at the local Serviço de Migração office for a study visa having entered Macau.
Residence.
Those wanting to take up residence in Macau for purposes of investment can do so via the Macau Trade and Investment Office in Macau, and then visit the local Serviço de Migração office.
Those wanting to take up residence for other reasons, such as employment, are required to make their application at their local Serviço de Migração office. The procedure varies depending on nationality and residency status. Chinese and Portuguese nationals should make their application via the Comissariado de Residentes at the local Serviço de Migração office, whilst foreign nationals should apply via the Comissariado de Estrangeiros at the local Serviço de Migração office.

Aryeman Ramsay (;born on 22 August 1980), popularly known simply as Aryeman is an Indian actor who appears in Bollywood films. He is the son of producer Keshu, and also a social activist.
Starting off his career by socializing in game advertisements, Ramsay made his Bollywood debut in "" (2006) and was nominated a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance. Following through with acclaimed performances in films like "Good Luck!" (2008) and "Ek Aadat" (2010), which was his only commercial and critical success movie yet, even though he believes that "a few bumps, that's when you hit the jackpot!"
Early life.
Aryeman was born on 22 August 1980, by Keshu Ramsay (part of the Ramsay Brothers) whose family are Sindhis. He attended Mithibai College, in Mumbai. His big break came when his father offered him a role in his action drama film, Family - Ties of Blood (2006), in which he co-starred Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, although the film failed, but he still got nominated for a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award.
Film career.
Aryeman basically started his acting career by playing a small role as a child-artist in 1991 in the romance film "Saugandh", which starred Akshay Kumar. He then debuted as an adult in his home-production, "Family - Ties of Blood", co-starring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar again and Bhumika Chawla. Even with a multi-strong cast and crew, the film flopped badly at the box office in India. 
He then starred in the 2008 comedy film "Good Luck!", along with Sayali Bhagat, Lucky Ali and Ranvir Shorey. "Good Luck!" was an official remake of the 2006 Hollywood film "Just My Luck". Even though "Just My Luck" was a blockbuster on Box office Mojo, "Good Luck!" was an absolute disappointment at Box Office India. The film was typed to be the biggest flop of the year "2008", and it seems "Good Luck!" did not have any luck at all. 
In 2010, he starred in the romantic comedy film "Ek Aadat". The film received mix reviews, but mostly negative, and still was Aryeman's first critical and commercial success at the box office. 
Currently, he is filming on 2 films for 2011, "Main Osama", where he plays MI chief Karan Choudhary, and Tom, Dick, and Harry Rock Again! which is the sequel to the 2006 comedy flick "Tom, Dick, and Harry!"

A Chinese visa is a permit issued by the Chinese visa authorities (Chinese embassies, consulates, and other offices authorized by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to a foreigner, that authorizes entry into, exit from, or transit through the People's Republic of China. Visa authorities may issue a Diplomatic, Courtesy, Official or Regular Visa to an alien, depending on his/her status and purpose of visit to China, and/or passport type.
If a foreigner (alien) intends to enter into, exit from or transit through Chinese territory, he/she must apply for a Chinese visa to the above-mentioned Chinese visa authorities, usually where they are located in countries outside China. This application does not need to be done in person, but for tourists the procurement of a Chinese visa usually requires presentation of the original "ordinary" (tourist) passport to the authority in question. The reason is that the visa document is affixed in the form of an adhesive non-removable permanent sticker to one of the ordinary passport's visa pages (i.e., usually the same pages upon which entry and exit stamps are placed in the passport by non-visa requiring countries). This process nominally requires a few days, requiring passports to be dropped off and picked up on separate days, as it cannot be done by mail. However, for an extra fee, the process may be done in many embassies and consulates in a few hours during a single working day. Since passports do not need to be presented by the holder, some third parties will provide this service. A single person in a travel group may also submit and retrieve passports to obtain visas for the others, so long as the application paperwork and signatures are in order.
Residents from Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR who hold a Hong Kong SAR passport or Macau SAR passport should apply for a Home Return Permit in order to visit Mainland China. Neither a passport nor a visa is required as Hong Kong and Macau are both Special Administrative Region of China and China does not constitute travelling between the SAR and the mainland as international travel despite a border still separate the respective territories. This permit is valid for 10 years regardless of the entry status, be it tourism or employment, and can be applies through the China Travel Service in Hong Kong and Macau respectively. Taiwan residents should apply for a Taiwanese Compatriot Pass and a visa endorsement (different from the normal visa held by foreigners) when visiting Mainland China. Visa endorsement as well as a one time compatriot pass can also be obtained from various port of entry or international airport in China on arrival. China consider Taiwan as their own territory and therefore does not recognize its passport, and they do not constitute travelling between China and Taiwan as international travel either. Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan citizen, if they are overseas and not bearing the Home Return Permit or the Taiwan Compatriot Pass, they should apply for a China Travel Document through a Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Government of the People's Republic of China allows citizens of a few specific countries (see below) to travel to the Chinese Mainland for tourism or business for up to 15 or 30 days without having to obtain a visa. However, these do not include countries in the Americas, the U.K., or Europe. Most foreign travellers to China (travel "to" China being defined as leaving the security zone of an international airport) are required to hold a visa. Exceptions to this requirement exist in certain parts of the country, such as Shanghai and Beijing, but not in most of the entry points into China.
China's visa policies are constantly changing, which has been the subject of both official comment and news reports. In fact, the Australian government warns its citizens: "The Chinese authorities have put in place more stringent requirements for visa issue... Police authorities (Public Security Bureau) have tightened regulations and are stringently enforcing regulations for the issue and renewal of visas."
In 2014 China announced a new policy to sign mutual visa-free travel agreements with as many countries as possible.

Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway

The Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway was a standard gauge railway in Cumberland, England. It opened for goods traffic in 1855 and for passenger traffic in 1857.
Route.
Mirehouse Junction, one mile south of Whitehaven (Corkickle) - Moor Row (junction)
Northern section.
Moor Row - Cleator Moor - Frizington - Eskett (later Yeathouse) - Winder - Rowrah - Wright Green (later Lamplugh) - Ullock - Branthwaite - Bridgefoot - Marron Junction (junction with the London & North Western Railway who took over the Cockermouth and Workington Railway in 1866) (Route in Google Maps)
Southern section.
Moor Row - Woodend - Egremont 
Company Branch Lines.
In addition to the locations shown in the Northern and Southern sections there were also several important WC&ER branchlines that served local industry. They were the Bigrigg, Beckermet, Crossfield, Eskett, Ehen Valley, Gillfoot, Mowbray, Palaflat, Ullcoats Branches. The Gillgaron Branch is included below.
The Egremont to Sellafield Section.
Egremont - Beckermet - Sellafield
In reality this was an independent railway to the WC&ER as it was jointly owned by the WC&ER and the Furness Railway and was known as the Cleator and Furness Railway, although it was worked by the WC&ER. This section was opened to traffic in 1869. There was one station on the line that was located at Beckermet. This section of railway also became part of the 'Joint Lines' when the WC&ER was taken over. (see below)
The Gillgaron Branch.
Parton - Distington- Ullock. This branchline is often overlooked by some authors and historians. It was important for it served an iron works at Distington.
Mergers.
Note: The Whitehaven & Furness Junction Railway that ran south from Whitehaven was absorbed into the Furness railway in 1866 and all references to the WFJR after this date should read Furness railway. 
In 1878 the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway was taken over by the London and North Western Railway and the Furness Railway objected to the takeover. The London and North Western Railway had in 1866 acquired two railways in the west of the county and had entered into an understanding with the Furness Railway that the L&NWR would not expand any further south in West Cumberland than the lines that were acquired in 1866. As a result the former WC&ER became joint property of the London and North Western Railway and the Furness Railway. At the 1923 grouping, both these railways were absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The LMS became part of British Railways at the 1948 nationalisation.
Closures.
Sections of the line closed in 1954 and the track was lifted in 1964. Other sections remained open for the conveyance of limestone from a quarry at Rowrah and iron ore from mines in the Egremont area. These closures are to be expanded sometime in the future when correct dates are researched and verified

Cleator and Furness Railway

Coverage of Railway; Egremont - Beckermet - Sellafield.
In 1864 it was proposed to extend the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway's line that ran from Moor Row to Egremont and by doing so extend it to Sellafield with a section of new railway. The Parlementary Act for this new railway was obtained in June 1864 and it was to be known as the Cleator and Furness Railway. When proposed the line would connect with the Whitehaven & Furness Junction Railway but soon afterwards, the W&FJR became part of the Furness Railway. The railway would open as the joint properties of the Furness Railway and the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway. 
It was worked by the WC&ER until the company sold out to the London & North Western Railway when the FR disputed the purchase. In 1866 the London & North Western Railway purchased two small railways in West Cumberland and the Furness Railway insisted the former company expanded no further in the Whitehaven area. An agreement was reached and it was this agreement that the Furness Railway maintained had been ignored when in 1878 the London & North Western Railway purchased the WC&ER lines. The following year an agreement was reached where the WC&ER would become the joint property of the Furness Railway and the London & North Western Railway after which the Cleator and Furness Railway became part of the LNWR & FR Joint Lines.

Craterellus tubaeformis

Craterellus tubaeformis (formerly "Cantharellus tubaeformis") is an edible fungus, also known as Yellowfoot, winter mushroom, or Funnel Chanterelle. It is mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic associations with plants, making it very challenging to cultivate. It is smaller than the golden chanterelle ("Cantharellus cibarius") and has a dark brown cap with paler gills and a hollow yellow stem. "C. tubaeformis" tastes stronger but less fruity than the golden chanterelle. It has a very distinctive smokey, peppery taste when raw.
"C. tubaeformis" is a yellowish-brown and trumpet-shaped mushroom found in great numbers late in the mushroom season, thus earning the common name winter mushroom. The cap is convex and sometimes hollow down the middle. The gills are widely separated, and of lighter color than the cap. It grows on moss or rotten wood, is found mostly in spruce forests. It is an excellent food mushroom, especially fried or in soups, and is easily dried for preservation.
Molecular phylogenetics has shown that "C. tubaeformis" deserves its reclassification from "Cantharellus" to "Craterellus". Additionally, it appears that there are two distinct genetic populations that have traditionally been called "tubaeformis": one in Europe and eastern North America, and another in western North America. If these two groups are defined as separate species, the "eastern" yellowfoot would retain the scientific epithet "tubaeformis" due to the origin of the type specimens in Sweden.
The western North American "C. tubaeformis" has been shown to make ectomycorrhizal relationships with western hemlock ("Tsuga heterophylla") and Douglas-fir ("Pseudotsuga menziesii"). It is also most common in forests with a large amount of well-rotted coarse woody debris.
Similar species.
"Craterellus lutescens" differs only in colours, but is more rare, and is found only from very wet places. Both mushrooms are edible and taste similar, and are usually mixed.

Rudolf von Auerswald

Rudolf Ludwig Cäsar von Auerswald (1 September 1795 – 15 January 1866) was a German official who served as Prime Minister of Prussia during the Revolution of 1848. Later, during the ministry of Charles Anthony, Prince of Hohenzollern, he led the government in all but name.
Biography.
Auerswald was born in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), West Prussia. He was a member of a Meissen family of nobility, first mentioned in 1263, from Auerswalde, now part of Lichtenau, Saxony. His father was the official Hans Jakob von Auerswald, while his brothers were the general Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald (1792–1848) and the politician Alfred von Auerswald (1797–1870).
A friend of Prince William, much of Auerswald's youth was spent in Königsberg. After the completion of his education he entered the 1. Leibhusarenregiment of the Prussian Army. In 1812 as part of Napoleon's invasion of Russia, Auerswald participated in campaigns in Livonia and Courland under the command of Yorck. He also served from 1813–15 during the wars against Napoleon. Auerswald remained in the military until 1821, when he was discharged as a cavalry captain.
Auerswald married his cousin Countess Adela Dohna-Lauck in 1817. After his discharge from the military he acquired an estate in the Heiligenbeil District of East Prussia, where he became "Landrat" (district administrator) in 1824. Auerswald became "General-Landschaftsrath" of the Province of Prussia in 1835 and "Oberbürgermeister" (roughly Lord Mayor) of Königsberg in 1835.
Auerswald was a member of the knighthood of the East Prussian provincial diet, sometimes with the role of parliamentary marshal ("Landtagsmarschall"). During a diet paying homage to King Frederick William IV of Prussia, Auerswald was one of the politicians who reminded the new king of the 1815 promise of his predecessor, Frederick William III, to grant a constitution. Auerswald became "Regierungspräsident" of Regierungsbezirk Trier in 1842.
After the outbreak of the March Revolution in 1848, Auerswald was named "Oberpräsident" in Königsberg of the Province of Prussia by Prime Minister Ludolf Camphausen. After Camphausen resigned, Auerswald became Prime Minister on 25 June, as well as Foreign Minister. A constitution for the Kingdom of Prussia was proposed during Auerswald's term; its model was the liberal Belgian Constitution of 1831, which had strongly influenced Rhenish liberalism. However, it was not accepted by the Prussian National Assembly, which created its own constitutional committee instead. Auerswald's ministry collapsed on 8 September when the National Assembly called for the government to demand the resignation of conservative members of the military.
After his resignation, Auerswald returned to his post as Oberpräsident in Königsberg. After the dissolution of the National Assembly, the imposition of the constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia and the vote for a new parliament of Prussia led Auerswald to return to national politics. He served as president of the First Chamber (later the Prussian House of Lords) until 1850. Auerswald also participated in the Erfurt Parliament. In 1850 he became Oberpräsident of the Rhine Province, but was forced to resign a year later for remarks critical of the conservative government. Auerswald then spent almost two years out of public office, traveling to Paris, Italy, and North Africa.
Auerswald became a member of the Second Chamber (the Prussian House of Representatives) in 1853 as part of the liberal opposition, owing to his friendship with Crown Prince William. After William's assumption of the Prussian regency and the end of the Manteuffel government, William named Charles Anthony, Prince of Hohenzollern, as Prime Minister. Auerswald served as a minister without portfolio, although he led the government in all but name. Hopes for a more liberal era ended, however, in the face of resistance from the civil service, the court of Regent William, and especially from the House of Representatives.
The military budgetary crisis of 1860 brought Auerswald in opposition to his own liberal party, but he sought a middle ground between William and parliament. The inability to form a compromise caused a splintering of the liberals in 1861. The lack of a liberal majority led to the resignation of Auerswald and a number of ministers in March 1862. The next government was led by Otto von Bismarck.
Auerswald resigned from politics completely. Despite his liberal views and the defeat of the Prussian liberals, he was not disgraced, and a court position as lord burgrave of Marienburg (Malbork) was created for him instead. Auerswald died in Berlin, Brandenburg.

<doc id="19317099" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19317099" title="Namaqua National Park">
Namaqua National Park

Namaqua National Park is a South African national park situated approximately 495 km north of Cape Town and 22 km northwest of Kamieskroon. It has an area of more than 700 km2. The park is part of Namaqualand, an area covering 55,000 km2 located within the semi-desert Succulent Karoo biome. This biome is a biodiversity hotspot with the largest concentration of succulent plants in the world. The park also has an arid environment with succulent plants. The park was created to protect its flowers. During the spring, wildflowers bloom there in a spectacular fashion. The park's main tourist attraction is this abundant spring bloom of brightly coloured wildflowers.
Geography and climate.
Namaqua National Park is located in Northern Cape Province, near South Africa's border with Namibia. The park is located approximately 495 km north of Cape Town and 22 km northwest of Kamieskroon. It was officially gazetted in August 1999. Skilpad Nature Reserve, formed in 1993 to protect Namaqualand's plant life, formed the nucleus of the new national park with the addition of 500 km² of land to create the park. 270 km² has since been added to the park, and it now has an area of more than 700 km². The park is semi-desert, with hot and dry summers and cold winters with variable, generally sparse rainfall. Most precipitation occurs between May and August. The eastern part of the park receives more rainfall than the west.
Biodiversity.
The park is part of the semi-desert Succulent Karoo biome, one of the most unusual biomes in the world. This biome is a biodiversity hotspot with the greatest biodiversity and the highest concentration of succulent plants of any of the world's arid regions. The biome has an area of about 107,200 km², stretching along South Africa's and southern Namibia's western coasts, and includes most of the Richtersveld. There are more than 5,000 plant species in this biome, including more than a third of all the succulent species in the world. Approximately 40% of the biome's plant species are endemic and 18% are threatened. The biome also has diverse invertebrate and reptile species, some of which are endemic. Illegal plant harvesting, overgrazing, and mining threaten endemic species. Only a very small percentage of the Succulent Karoo's area is formally protected, including the Knersvlakte Nature Reserve, the Richtersveld Community Conservancy, and Namaqua National Park.
The park is located in Namaqualand, which lies within the Succulent Karoo. Namaqualand has an area covering 55,000 km², located in the northwest corner of Northern Cape Province. During most of the year, very little flora except hardy shrubs can be seen in Namaqualand's arid landscape. However in August and September, after the winter's rains, wildflowers bloom in a spectacular fashion over hundreds of square kilometres. These many-coloured flowers include daisies, lilies, aloes, and perennial herbs. Namaqualand is famous throughout the world for the spectacular sight of its many coloured wildflowers during the spring. About 4,000 plant species grow in this area, and Namaqualand has more than 1,000 types of flowers that do not grow anywhere else in the world. It has many species of succulent plants, for example "vygies" which have attractive blooms. The plump leaves of many types of succulents retain moisture, and many of them grow low to the ground and have a stone-like appearance. Some species of trees here can store water in the dry environment, such as the aloe quiver tree's fat trunk. The flowers' blooms are dependent on the amount of rainfall that the area receives. The flowers are sensitive to sunlight and many will only open when there is bright sunshine. The flowers face the sun, and they generally open completely from about 10 am to 4 pm. Hot winds can cause the blooms to quickly shrivel. Many insect species are attracted to the flowers. The Speckled Padloper, the smallest tortoise in the world, can be found in the park.
Tourism.
An estimated 100,000 tourists visit Namaqualand every year. 65% of these visitors are South African and 35% are from other countries. The government has identified tourism as a means to improve the region's economy, and tourism in this area has been promoted through marketing. However, the region's residents continue to have very low incomes and there is a high unemployment rate.
Namaqua National Park has the ecological tourist attractions of the wider Namaqualand region. The bloom of spring flowers in disused wheat fields is the park's main tourist attraction. Tourist facilities include a 5 km long scenic route, two nature walks, places to picnic, and an information centre for visitors. The park has not yet been fully developed and the Skilpad area of the park can only be visited by tourists during the flower season in the spring. Most of the wildflower species are protected under law, with the possibility of fines for those who pick them.
There are now 4 chalets available for overnight accommodation, 1 of which is accessible to disbaled persons. Accommodation is for 2 adults with provision for 1 adult or 2 children on a sleep couch.
These are very well equipped and all have an awesome view from the stoep area. There is 220v electricity but you will need to bring all your own provisions. (The nearest basic shop is 22 km away)

DRL Group

Dorman Roberts Limited, marketed as the DRL Group or Roberts Group of Companies, is a transportation and travel management company based in Triton, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.
The company traces its roots to 1922 when Samuel G. Roberts, father of Dorman Roberts, purchased a general store, subsequently expanding into wholesale groceries and consumer items, import/export businesses, marine vessels, fish processing, saw mills, and trucking companies. In 1961, the DRL Group employed 1000 people in the province and operated a fleet of 11 ships off the Labrador coast.
The decline of the saltwater fishery saw the company refocus on passenger transportation and travel management, following its takeover of CN Roadcruiser inter-city motor coach bus transportation on the island of Newfoundland in 1996. The company also operates charter buses, particularly for cruise ship companies calling at Newfoundland ports and was previously an inter-city bus operator, charter bus operator and school bus operator in the Maritimes.

<doc id="19317177" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19317177" title="Michael Willmann">
Michael Willmann

Michael Leopold Lukas Willmann (27 September 1630 – 26 August 1706) was a German painter. The Baroque artist became known as the "Silesian Rembrandt".
Life.
Willmann was born in Königsberg, Duchy of Prussia. He was educated by his father, the painter, Christian Peter Willmann. Michael went to the Dutch Republic in 1650 to learn from the masters, and he was inspired by the works of Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony van Dyck. For financial reasons he was unable to afford studying at the studio of a well-known painter.
After two years in the Netherlands, mostly spent in Amsterdam, Willmann returned to Königsberg, passed his master's examination, and began to travel. After visiting Danzig (Gdańsk), Willmann went to Prague, where he stayed from 1653–55. He then spent about a year in Breslau (Wrocław). Willmann's first known paintings, commissioned by Abbot Arnold Freiberger of the Abbatia Lubensis abbey in Leubus, Lower Silesia, date from 1656. Leubus became the setting of much of Willmann's creativity.
From 1657–58 Willmann was in Berlin as the court painter of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. He painted mythological scenes for the elector, presumably for his residence at Königsberg Castle. In 1660 Willmann returned to Leubus, which allowed him a large workshop.
Willmann's workship, modeled after those of the Dutch painters, quickly spread his fame. The extensive studio included his son Michael Leopold Willmann the Younger, his daughter Anna Elisabeth, and Anna Elisabeth's husband Christian Neuenhertz and son Georg Wilhelm Neunhertz. Willmann's studio also counted Johann Kretschmer from Glogau (Głogów), Johann Jacob Eybelwieser from Breslau, the Cistercian Jacob Arlet from Grüssau, and Willmann's stepson Johann Christoph Lischka.
Willmann became the leading painter of Silesia through his expressiveness, technical dexterity, and speed. Willmann worked on orders from the patriciate of Breslau, as well as churches and monasteries throughout Silesia, Bohemia, and Moravia. He received contracts for the Cistercian monasteries in Grüssau, Heinrichau, Kamenz, Rauden, and Himmelwitz. With the assistance of his students and assistants, Willmann produced 500 paintings and frescos during his life. Numerous drawings of Willmann's were later used by engravers.
On 26 November 1662 Willmann married Helena Regina Lischka from Prague. In May 1663 he converted from Calvinism to Roman Catholicism and took the baptismal names "Leopold" (after the emperor) and "Lukas" (after the patron saint of painters). Willmann's prosperity allowed him to acquire a manor near Leubus and sponsor the educations of his son and stepson in Italy. Willmann was detailed in "Academia", the 1683 Latin edition of Joachim von Sandrart's "“Teutsche Academie der edlen Bau-, Bild und Malereikünste”". Painters influenced by Willmann include Wenzel Lorenz Reiner, Peter Brandl, Johann Michael Rottmayr, and Franz Anton Maulbertsch.
Willmann died in Leubus, where he was buried in the abbey's crypt alongside the abbots. Because his son died a year later, the studio passed to Willmann's stepson, Johann Christoph Lischka, until 1712, and to Willmann's grandson, Georg Wilhelm Neunhertz, until 1724, after which it closed. Willmann's house was destroyed in a fire in 1849.

Freida Pinto

Freida Selena Pinto (born 18 October 1984) is an Indian actress and model. Hailing from a Mangalorean Catholic family, she wanted to become an actress from a young age. Prior to making her cinematic debut, she worked as a model and television presenter, and acted in plays while attending college. Pinto continued modeling for four years and enrolled herself in an acting course at the "Barry John's Acting Studio" in Mumbai, where she was trained by Barry John.
Pinto rose to prominence by playing the leading lady in the 2008 British drama film "Slumdog Millionaire", a film that marked her debut. Her performance was well received, and she won the "Breakthrough Performance Award" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. In addition, she was nominated at various award ceremonies such as British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) and MTV Movie Awards. Since then she has starred in a number of British and American productions, notably "You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger" (2010), "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" (2011), "Immortals" (2011), and "Trishna" (2011), where she played the titular character.
Pinto is a part of the "Agassi Foundation", a philanthropic organization started by Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf which looks after providing education for deprived children.
Early life and modeling career.
Pinto was born into a Mangalorean Catholic household in Mumbai. Her mother Sylvia is the principal of St. John's High School, Goregaon, and her father Frederick is a senior branch manager at the Bank of Baroda. Pinto has an elder sister, Sharon, who works as an associate producer of NDTV, a news channel. Pinto aspired to become an actress when she was five years old. Pinto studied at the Carmel of St. Joseph School in Malad, Mumbai, where she actively participated in sports and sang in the school choir. By the time when she was ten, Sushmita Sen won Miss Universe 1994, which in turn inspired the former to become an actress and proved to be a defining point in her career. She completed a degree in arts with a major in English literature, and minors in Psychology and Economics, from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.
Pinto is an accomplished dancer in Salsa and Classical Indian dance. She actively participated in plays and amateur theatre while attending college. Later she joined the Elite Model Management and modeled for two-and-half years. Pinto was featured in several television and print advertisements endorsing products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, E-Bay and DeBeers. She continued to model for four years and appeared in runway shows and magazine covers including "Femina" and "FNL". Pinto joined an acting course at "The Barry John's Acting Studio" in Andheri, Mumbai where she was trained by theatre director Barry John.
Acting career.
Beginnings and breakthrough (2008–10).
Before her entry into films, Pinto anchored "Full Circle", an international travel show which was aired on Zee International Asia Pacific in English from 2006 to 2008. During this time, she visited countries such as Fiji, Malaysia and Thailand. By that time Pinto auditioned for numerous films, all of which turned out to be unsuccessful. Later in an interview while being questioned about her rejections she added, "I'm glad things happened the way they happened. I needed to be rejected, and I needed to learn that it's part of the game... I can have 100 rejections, but I'm sure there's going to be one particular thing that is almost destined for me to have". She received a call for "Slumdog Millionaire"; she was short-listed and finally selected to star in the film. Directed by Danny Boyle the film starred Dev Patel, Anil Kapoor, and Irrfan Khan. Pinto played the role of Latika, the love interest of the lead character, Jamal. Dubbed as India's answer to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", the film was made on a moderate budget of USD 15 million. "Slumdog Millionaire" turned out to be a sleeper hit, receiving universal acclaim, mainly for its plot and soundtrack. It also played a vital role in launching the career of Pinto in Hollywood. The film opened to international acclaim at the 33rd Toronto International Film Festival winning the Cadillac People's Choice Award. It emerged as the most successful film at the 81st Academy Awards winning eight of the ten nominations, including major categories such as Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film also gained nominations at various award ceremonies including the Golden Globe Awards, where it won four awards. Pinto herself was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the 2009 BAFTA Awards. In addition, she won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture alongside other cast members from the film.
Pinto next starred in Woody Allen's comedy-drama film "You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger", alongside Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, Anupam Kher and Naomi Watts. The film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, receiving negative reviews. Pinto played a minor role as the character Dia. She next appeared in the 2011 science fiction film "Rise of the Planet of the Apes", a reboot of the "Planet of the Apes" series, where she played Caroline, a primatologist, and was cast opposite James Franco. Pinto played the central character in her next production "Miral", a biographical film based on a novel by Rula Jebreal. The film opened to negative reviews. A review from East Bay Express noted, "Pinto handles the central role with a certain dignity, but the real drama is in Miral's rejection of violence in favor of Hind Husseini’s (Abbass) example of education and negotiation." Following that, Pinto starred in 2011 fantasy-action-drama film, "Immortals", in which she played the oracle priestess Phaedra. The same year, she played "Princess Lailah" in the 1930s-set period drama film "Black Gold"; she was cast alongside Antonio Banderas and Mark Strong.
"Trishna" and the future (2011–present).
In 2011, Pinto starred in Michael Winterbottom's British drama film "Trishna" alongside Riz Ahmed; she played the titular character in the film. An adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel "Tess of the d'Urbervilles", the film first premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. Described by "The Guardian" as a "seductive, allegorical study of male-female relationships", the film features Pinto as the daughter of a peasant who falls in love with a London-based hotelier, played by Ahmed. Unlike her previous films, "Trishna" gained positive response from critics. The film was universally acclaimed as it was nominated for the Best Film Award at the London Film Festival and Grand Prix at the Tokyo International Film Festival.
In October 2013, Pinto was seen in Bruno Mars's single Gorilla. She was criticised by the Indian media for a sequence involving shedding her clothes and getting intimate with Mars. Nevertheless, MTV described the act as "one gloriously cinematic scene", while James Montgomery of the channel further added "Thanks to Pinto's wattage". Pinto's forthcoming releases include "Desert Dancer" and "Misfits". "Desert Dancer" is a biographical drama film that revolves around the life of a dancer. Pinto underwent rigorous dance training consisting of eight hours of rehearsals a day lasting for 14 weeks, as demanded by the role. As of 2013, she is scheduled to act with Christian Bale in "Knight of Cups". "Misfits" is a Comedy-drama film which will star Guy Pearce alongside her. On choosing Pinto for the role, Doug Claybourne, the film's producer commented "Freida is the perfect fit: Intelligent and talented, and she completely gets the humor in this story about finding family."
Media image and personal life.
Soon after the release of "Slumdog Millionaire", Pinto garnered immense popularity and was frequently included in the "Most Beautiful Women in the World" list. In 2009, she was featured in "People" magazine's "Most Beautiful People List", and "List of World's Best Dressed Women". The same year, "Daily Telegraph" reported that Pinto was the highest-paid Indian actress, although she never appeared in a Bollywood film. She was also included in "Vogue"'s 2009 list of the "top ten most stylish women". On 13 May 2009, Pinto became a new spokesmodel for L'Oréal. A controversy arose when she appeared in a TV commercial promoting L'Oreal, as many thought it to be racial discrimination from countries that are possessive about fair skin. The commercial showcased Pinto in what many perceived to be a lighter skin tone due to make-up or editing. In 2010, she was featured in the "Top 99 Most Desirable Women" poll conducted by AskMen. Two years later, "People" named her one of the "Most Beautiful at Every Age". The following year, Pinto was voted the "Hottest Indian Chick" in a controversial poll conducted by "GQ".
Before making her film debut Pinto was engaged to former publicist Rohan Antao; the relationship ended in January 2009. After that she started dating her "Slumdog Millionaire" co-star Dev Patel. Since then the couple have been living together in Los Angeles, United States. Later in an interview, Pinto stated that she does not want to act with Patel as she feels they will not be able to mete out the "chemistry" they had in their debut film. Pinto was criticised for having "shunned" the Indian film industry. However, she claimed that she is unable to find roles that suit her in Bollywood. She also stated that she enjoys watching Bollywood films and is keen to act in future.
Pinto joined Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf in support of their philanthropic organisation, the "Agassi Foundation". She is the only Indian actress to have participated in their annual fund raiser titled, "The 15th Grand Slam for Children", aimed at raising funds for the education of underprivileged children. In 2012 Freida Pinto joined Plan International’s Because I am a Girl Campaign as Global Ambassador, promoting gender equality to lift millions of girls out of poverty. In 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci's "Chime for Change" campaign to raise funds and awareness of women's issues in terms of education, health, and justice. In April 2013, Pinto collaborated with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim for the "Call to Action – Girl Rising" campaign. The documentary film "Girl Rising" made by Academy Award nominee Richard E. Robbins, showcases the power of education in transforming girls' lives around the globe.

The Government of Hong Kong allows citizens of specific countries/territories to travel to Hong Kong for tourism or certain business-related activities for periods ranging from 14 to 180 days without having to obtain a visa. Citizens of all countries require visas to undertake other activities, such as study, employment, or "operation" of a business, unless they have the right to land or right of abode in Hong Kong. Under the One Country, Two Systems policy, Hong Kong maintains its immigration and visa policy independently from (the rest of) China. Consequently, entering Hong Kong from (mainland) China requires passing through an immigration checkpoint. Whilst Macao and Taiwan residents have visa-free/visa-on-arrival access for short visits to Hong Kong, Chinese citizens from China need to go through a more rigorous approval system before they can obtain a permit to enter Hong Kong.
Due to the historical background of Hong Kong, immigration status in Hong Kong is determined by a combination of both nationality and residence status. Therefore, even a Chinese national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a slightly different status to a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong as well (since the former can never lose ROA status while the latter can lose it if he does not enter Hong Kong for a period of 36 months). At the same time, a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a preferential immigration status to a Chinese national without the right of abode in Hong Kong, as the former can remain in Hong Kong indefinitely, while the latter has to have his immigration status reassessed whenever his visa/permit expires.
All visitors must hold a passport valid for 1 month.
Unconditional stay.
Persons with the "right of abode" or the "right to land" may enter Hong Kong without holding any visa and without having any condition of stay imposed upon them, and may not be subject to a removal order. In addition, no deportation order may be imposed on a person with the right of abode. Possession of one of the following documents is sufficient to demonstrate those rights:
A person who is "ordinarily resident" in Hong Kong for seven years is eligible to apply for permanent residency, a status which gives its holder the right of abode. However, the Immigration Ordinance's definition of "ordinarily resident" (Section 2, Subsection 4) excludes persons holding visas for employment as imported workers or for employment as domestic helpers. It is not unusual to find foreign domestic helpers who have worked in Hong Kong for fifteen years; however, regardless of their length of employment, they are ineligible to apply for permanent residency. In 2011, five domestic helpers filed applications in the High Court for judicial review of the relevant portion of the Immigration Ordinance, claiming that it contravenes Article 24 of the Hong Kong Basic Law. In response, the Department of Justice sought to enter into evidence an affidavit claiming that as many as 100,000 domestic helpers could qualify for permanent residency; along with as many as 300,000 family members, the department claimed this would cause significant economic losses due to the requirement to provide housing, welfare, and health services to them. The first case, Vallejos v. Commissioner of Registration, was heard on 22 August. Starry Lee (DAB) and tourism functional constituency legislator Paul Tse expressed their opposition, while the Civic Party issued a statement distancing itself from the cases. Justice Johnson Lam issued his decision on 30 September, ruling in favour of Vallejos; the government will appeal.
Types of non-visitor visas.
Persons without the right of abode or right to land in Hong Kong, regardless of their nationality, require visas if they wish to take up residence in the territory. Persons granted these visas become "non-permanent residents". Immigration Department policy places restrictions on the ability of nationals of Afghanistan, Albania, Cuba, Nepal, North Korea, and Vietnam to apply for some kinds of visas.
Employment, investment, and study visas.
Hong Kong has a number of visas issued for the purpose of allowing the holder to take up employment or employment-related training:
The immigration department also grants student visas for persons wishing to study in registered private (non-public, non-aided) primary and secondary schools, and for various types of study at the degree level (short courses, exchange programmes, and certificate or degree courses). Chinese residents of the mainland and Taiwan, and residents of Macau who moved there from mainland China and settled later than 14 January 1979, are only granted visas to study in tertiary-level courses. Since the 2008/09 academic year, student visa holders in degree courses of more than a year's duration at tertiary institutions may take up short-term internships; other student visa holders are prohibited from taking up any employment at all. 14,460 non-local students (among them 8,651 from mainland China) were admitted to Hong Kong for study in 2009/10.
Other types of visas include the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) visa, the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) visa, and the investment visa.
Nationals of Afghanistan, Albania, Cambodia, Cuba, and North Korea, are not eligible for any of these visas; nationals of Laos, Nepal and Vietnam are only eligible for CIES.
Dependent visas.
Persons on unconditional stay, as well as those granted visas for study, training, employment as professionals, investment, or under CIES or QMAS, may sponsor their spouse and dependent children under the age of 18 for entry into Hong Kong. Persons on unconditional stay may additionally sponsor elderly dependent parents who are over the age of 60. However, persons on unconditional stay cannot sponsor Chinese citizens with household registration in mainland China as dependents. Additionally, nationals of Afghanistan, Albania, Cuba, and North Korea are not eligible for dependent visas. Dependent visa holders whose sponsor (parent or spouse, as the case may be) holds a study visa require prior permission from the Immigration Department in order to take up employment; other dependent visa holders may work or switch jobs without prior approval.
Unlike Hong Kong residents in opposite-sex marriages, Hong Kong residents in same-sex marriages with non-Hong Kong residents cannot sponsor their partners for dependent visas. However, according to a July 2011 report by the "South China Morning Post", the Hong Kong Immigration Department has an unpublicised policy of granting extended visitors' visas to non-Hong Kong residents in same-sex marriages with Hong Kong residents. This allows them to stay in the city for "de facto" family reunification, though they cannot take up employment, will not receive a Hong Kong Identity Card, and while holding a visitor's visa will not be regarded as "ordinarily resident" in Hong Kong for purposes of permanent residency applications. However, they may renew their visas without departing from Hong Kong.
Visitors' visas and visa exemptions.
Nationals of the following 148 countries can enter Hong Kong visa-free. They can do so as tourists or they can undertake a limited range of business-related activities, namely "concluding contracts or submitting tenders, examining or supervising the installation/packaging of goods or equipment, participating in exhibitions or trade fairs (except selling goods or supplying services direct to the general public, or constructing exhibition booths), settling compensation or other civil proceedings, participating in product orientation, and attending short-term seminars or other business meetings". They are prohibited from taking up employment or study in the territory, or from "establishing or joining in any business". The last provision means that non-residents may not commence operating a business while in Hong Kong, and thus will be refused permission for business registration by the Inland Revenue Department unless it can be proven that the business began operation while they were outside of Hong Kong. However, the Companies Registry permits non-residents to incorporate limited liability companies and to be appointed as corporate directors (though not as corporate secretaries).
Diplomatic/official passports.
Visa free for 14 days for holders of diplomatic or official passports of the following countries: 
Visa nationals.
Nationals of the following countries are required to possess a visa for any type of entry into Hong Kong (including as tourists), but are not required to have a visa to transit airside if they remain within the airport transit area:
Nationals of the following countries are required to possess a visa for any type of entry into Hong Kong (including as tourists) and for transit airside (even if they remain within the airport transit area):
Visa requirements for persons holding certain kinds of travel documents.
The above visa waivers apply only to citizens of the countries in question travelling on standard national passports. Persons using other kinds of travel documents, in particular those which are issued to non-citizens (especially under "investor passport" programmes) or which are issued as emergency travel documents in case of the loss of a passport, are required to obtain visas. The Hong Kong Immigration Department specifically lists the following kinds of travel documents as not entitling their holders to enjoy visa-free access, notwithstanding that they are issued by countries whose citizens normally enjoy visa-free access:
In addition all holders of stateless persons' travel documents are also required to obtain visas.
Taiwan.
Since 27 April 2009, Taiwan residents who hold a Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents may enter Hong Kong for up to 30 days without obtaining an entry permit in advance. Otherwise, a valid entry permit must be applied in advance. Currently only airlines and appointed travel agents are authorized to this application while a fee of HKD50 applies. From 1 September 2012, ordinary people may apply the entry permit online free of charge. The entry permit is not a visa and it is not affixed to the ROC passport. Hong Kong immigration officers do not stamp the ROC passport; rather, stamps will be placed on the entry permit.
Mainland China and Macao.
Regarding persons living in mainland China or Macao who do not possess the right of abode in Hong Kong, non-Chinese nationals are treated on the basis of their nationality, while Chinese nationals are treated based on the region in which they have a right of abode or household registration.
Chinese nationals with a hukou registration in China are required to obtain an entry permit from the Public Security Bureau for any type of visit to Hong Kong (short visits and long visits alike, including settlement), as well as a visa endorsement for the purpose of travel. However, an exemption is made for Mainland Chinese passport holders who are transiting through Hong Kong to a third country: they may enter Hong Kong for a maximum of seven days if they have proof of their onward journey.
Chinese nationals with the right of abode in Macao can enter Hong Kong visa-free for a maximum period of 180 days using their Macao permanent identity card. Non-permanent identity card holders can enter visa-free for up to 30 days only.

The Last of the Winnebagos

"The Last of the Winnebagos" is a short story written by Connie Willis. It was first published in "Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine" in 1988 and reprinted in the short story collection "Impossible Things" in 1994.
Plot synopsis.
The story, set in Arizona, takes place in a dystopian future where a pandemic called newparvo (a virulent strain of canine parvovirus) has killed all the dogs. In the wake of this disaster the Humane Society, referred to somewhat ominously as "the Society", has been given enormous powers within the government. The story's main character, photojournalist David McCombe, is haunted because despite being a professional photographer, none of the dog portraits he had taken show the personality of the subjects, and of his own dog, Aberfan, he has no pictures at all.

Georgia for Georgians

Georgia for Georgians is a political slogan and ethno-nationalist doctrine attributed to Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the first President of the Republic of Georgia, and his supporters.
For ethnic Georgians, the doctrine represents their independence, whilst for non-Georgian citizens of Georgia it represents the diminishing of their political and cultural rights within the Georgian state, creating an environment whereby the ethnic minority groups in Georgia are made to feel privileged that they are allowed to live on Georgian territory, and is seen by lev Dzugayev and Liana Kvirchelia as a pretext for ethnic cleansing in regions such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and is in part responsible for conflicts which permeate Georgia today.
Gamsakhurdia himself said he had never "proclaimed" the slogan and referred to it as "a cynic invention of Moscow's propaganda machine". One of Gamsakhurdia citations, concerning the demographic situation of Georgia's Kakheti region, was "minorities should be chopped up, they should be burned out with a red-hot iron from the Georgian nation... We will deal with all the traitors, hold all of them to proper account, and drive all the evil enemies and non-Georgians...!"
Gamsakhurdia era.
Whilst both Gia Chanturia and Merab Kostava have been credited with its authorship, the slogan first appeared in April 1989 when political rallies were held in Tbilisi in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic against Soviet rule. Accompanied by other slogans such as "The Soviet Union is the Prison of Nations" and "Long Live a Free, Democratic Georgia", "Georgia for Georgians" was the most famous, and worked to attract large crowds to the nationalist demonstrations. In 1993, Zviad Gamsakhurdia denied ever having "proclaimed" the slogan and dismissed it as an "invention of the Moscow's propaganda machine", at the same time accusing the Western mass media of repeating "in full the elaborate lies of Soviet propaganda". Zviad's son, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, also maintains that his father never actually said the slogan, and claims the South Ossetia issue was not about nationality but politics.
On 26 May 1991, Gamsakhurdia was elected first President of Georgia with a landslide victory of 86%, after campaigning on a platform of Georgian nationalism, "Georgia for Georgians".
Gamsakhurdia's electoral platform proposed measures to "protect" the Georgian state and ethnos: 
Gamsakhurdia based his ethnic policy on distinguishing between those in Georgia he labeled "indigenous" and "settlers", or "temporary guests", which led Soviet dissident and academic Andrey Sakharov to call Georgia the "little empire". The more than 1.5 million ethnic minorities who lived in Georgia were to considered to be the major threat to the Georgian people, which also resulted in anti-Islamic propaganda being published in the media. In 1989 Gamsakhurdia proclaimed "Today, we are facing a serious problem. Tatars, Armenians and Ossetians have risen to their feet. We must save from foreigners Kakhetia – our holy land!" 
Gamsakhurdia claimed the slogan was directed against the Soviet domination of Georgia. Once in power, much of the extreme nationalist agenda was put aside, and he frequently sought to reassure minorities that existing political-administrative system would not be changed without the consent of the respective groups and that the cultural rights of all ethnic groups would be respected. In July 1991, the Parliament of Georgia adopted a law granting citizenship to almost all residents of Georgia.
Effect on Ossetians.
At a political rally in 1989 in the village of Eredvi, Gamsakhurdia described the Ossetian people as "trash that has to be swept out through a tunnel", and in 1991 told foreign reporters that Georgia's Ossetians were unwanted "guests" who should "go back" to North Ossetia. He claimed, "in Georgia, there are Ossetians, but no Ossetia".
This policy resulted in the decision of the South Ossetian parliament in 1989 to declare its intent to unite with North Ossetia as part of the Russian Federation, resulting in the revocation of South Ossetia's autonomy and the merger of the region by the Georgian authorities to Shida Kartli (literally "Interior Georgia").
Effect on Abkhazians.
In Georgia, the slogan "Abkhazia is Georgia" was also used, although "Georgia for Georgians" was the more popular. Protesters at mass rallies in 1989 demanded the abolition of autonomy for Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Gamsakhurdia told West Georgians in an address that he planned to assimilate or oust Abkhazians from their land. Liana Kvarchelia claims his policies found little criticism in the Georgian community, rather the image painted by Gamsakhurdia of an enemy united Georgian society in the midst of internal political struggle. The policy was one catalyst which led to Chairman of the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet Vladislav Ardzinba to declare "Abkhazia is for Abkhazians", which in turn provoked the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia.
Effect on other nationalities.
The Meskhetian Turks who during the Great Patriotic War were deported by Joseph Stalin to Central Asia, were unable to return to Georgia under the "Georgia for Georgians" policy. Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaya in a report for the Federal Union of European Nationalities stated that although there was a small repatriation of Meskhetian Turks to the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in the 1970s and 1980s under Eduard Shevardnadze, "Georgia for Georgians" had led "de facto" to a second deportation from Georgia, and cited the example of a Meskhet settlement in the Zulukidse region which was destroyed in 1990, and has still not been rebuilt.
Azeris, numbering 300,000+, received no representation in the Georgian parliament, and many were forced to move from the land on which they had lived for centuries.
Doctrine in the post-Gamsakhurdia era.
In October 2004 Anna Matveeva for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that nationalism in Georgia continues to help hide social and economic problems by blaming those problems on outside interference, usually by Russia and Armenia. In 2005 Mikheil Saakashvili, the current president of Georgia, stated that "Georgia for Georgians" is a "poisonous nationalistic slogan" and he would implement new policy which "declares Georgia the motherland of all its citizens." However, Georgian politician-in-exile Igor Giorgadze and Professor of Political Science at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations Andranik Migranyan claims that the doctrine has continued to be used by the political establishment in Georgia under Saakashvili.

<doc id="19317343" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19317343" title="Isosceles triangle theorem">
Isosceles triangle theorem

In Euclidean geometry, the isosceles triangle theorem, also known as the pons asinorum, states that the angles opposite the two equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal. It is, in essence, the content of proposition 5 in Book I of Euclid's Elements.
"Pons asinorum".
In medieval times, when geometry was one of the four subjects of the quadrivium, this theorem acquired a reputation as an early yet difficult proposition and those who did not master its proof would be unable to go on to more advanced material. Perhaps because of this, the theorem became known as the "pons asinorum" or asses' bridge and is used as a metaphor for any early, difficult test.
Proofs.
Euclid and Proclus.
Euclid's statement of the theorem includes a second conclusion that if the equal sides of the triangle are extended below the base, then the angles between the extensions and the base are also equal. Euclid's proof involves drawing auxiliary lines to these extensions. But, as Euclid's commentator Proclus points out, Euclid never uses the second conclusion and his proof can be simplified somewhat by drawing the auxiliary lines to the sides of the triangle instead, the rest of the proof proceeding in more or less the same way. There has been much speculation and debate as to why, given that it makes the proof more complicated, Euclid added the second conclusion to the theorem. One plausible explanation, given by Proclus, is that the second conclusion can be used in possible objections to the proofs of later propositions where Euclid does not cover every case. The proof relies heavily on what is today called side-angle-side, the previous proposition in the "Elements".
Proclus' variation of Euclid's proof proceeds as follows: 
Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. Pick an arbitrary point D on side AB and construct E on AC so that AD=AE. Draw the lines BE, DC and DE. Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and angle A is equal to itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and angles are equal. Therefore angle ABE = angle ACD, angle ADC = angle AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts. Now consider the triangles DBE and ECD; BD=CE, BE=CD, and angle DBE = angle ECD have just been shown, so applying side-angle-side again, the triangles are congruent. Therefore angle BDE = angle CED and angle BED = angle CDE. Since angle BDE = angle CED and angle CDE = angle BED, angle BDC = angle CEB by subtraction of equal parts. Consider a third pair of triangles, BDC and CEB; DB=EC, DC=EB, and angle BDC = angle CEB, so applying side-angle-side a third time, the triangles are congruent. In particular, angle CBD = BCE, which was to be proved.
Pappus.
Proclus gives a much shorter proof attributed to Pappus of Alexandria. This is not only simpler but it requires no additional construction at all. The method of proof is to apply side-angle-side to the triangle and its mirror image. More modern authors, in imitation of the method of proof given for the previous proposition have described this as picking up the triangle, turning it over and laying it down upon itself.
This method is lampooned by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson in "Euclid and his Modern Rivals", calling it an "Irish bull" because it apparently requires the triangle to be in two places at once.
The proof is as follows: 
Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. Consider the triangles ABC and ACB, where ACB is considered a second triangle with vertices A, C and B corresponding respectively to A, B and C in the original triangle. Angle A is equal to itself, AB=AC and AC=AB, so by side-angle-side, triangles ABC and ACB are congruent. In particular angle B = angle C.
Others.
A standard textbook method is to construct the bisector of the angle at A.
This is simpler than Euclid's proof, but Euclid does not present the construction of an angle bisector until proposition 9. So the order of presentation of the Euclid's propositions would have to be changed to avoid the possibility of circular reasoning. 
The proof proceeds as follows: As before, let the triangle be ABC with AB = AC. Construct the angle bisector of angle BAC and extend it to meet BC at X. AB = AC and AX is equal to itself. Furthermore angle BAX = angle CAX, so, applying side-angle-side, BAX and CAX are congruent. It follows that the angles at B and C are equal.
Legendre uses a similar construction in "Éléments de géométrie", but taking X to be the midpoint of BC. The proof is similar but side-side-side must be used instead of side-angle-side, and side-side-side is not given by Euclid until later in the "Elements".
In inner product spaces.
The isosceles triangle theorem holds in inner product spaces over the real or complex numbers. In such spaces, it takes a form that says of vectors "x", "y", and "z" that if
then
Since
and
where "θ" is the angle between the two vectors, the conclusion of this inner product space form of the theorem is equivalent to the statement about equality of angles.

Ğädel Qutuy

Qutuyıv Ğädelşa Nurmöxämmät ulı (pronounced ; Tatar Cyrillic: Кутуев Гаделша Нурмөхәммәт улы; , Kutuy Adel Nurmukhammetovich), better known as Ğädel Qutuy (; Janalif: Ƣədel Qutuj; Tatar Cyrillic: Гадел Кутуй; ; frequently anglicized as Adel Kutuy; 28 November 1903 Tatarskie Kynady, Kuznetsky Uyezd, Saratov Governorate Russian Empire – 15 June 1945 Zgierz, Poland) was a Soviet Tatar poet, writer and playwright.
Life.
Qutuy moved to Kazan in 1922, and 5 year later gained recognition as one of five the most prominent Tatar writer. Impressed by Mayakovsky, he established Tatar analogue of "LEF", "SULF", i.e. Sul Front – Left Front. In 1930, after "Cidegän" affair was concocted, he was imprisoned. However, he managed to prove guiltiness and was released after 8 month of trial. After this, he wrote his the most prominent novels. In 1941 he volunteered to the Red Army to fight against Nazis in the World War II. In 1944 he became a war correspondent. In March 1945 he caught a cold and eventually dead in hospital.
Legacy.
His early verses, such as published in "Könnär yögergändä" ("When the Days Fly", 1924) contributed to futurism. A poem "Talantlar watanı" ("The Birthplace of the Talents", 1937), novels "Soltannıñ ber köne" ("One day of the Life of Soltan", 1938), "Wocdan ğazabı" ("The Torments of Conscience", 1939) are about role of intelligentsia in society.

Cathedral Building

Located in Oakland, California, the Cathedral Building, originally named the Federal Realty Building, was the first Gothic Revival style skyscraper west of the Mississippi River. It is also called the "Wedding Cake" for its appearance, which resembles New York's Flatiron Building. Its narrow, triangular form is a result of its location on Latham Square, where Telegraph Avenue branches off diagonally from Broadway. It was built by architect Benjamin Geer McDougall, who designed the steel framed building. The building has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was developed by Brog Properties, a Downtown Oakland development firm. They are renovating the building for mixed residential and commercial units. Currently over 70 percent occupied, the historic building houses prominent architectural and engineering firms such as JRDV Architects and TJC and Associates, Inc.
