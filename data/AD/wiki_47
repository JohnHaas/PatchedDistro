TS Koszarawa 1910 Żywiec

The team was founded in 1910, in southern Polish town of Żywiec, which then belonged to Austria-Hungary. Among founders, there were such personalities, as Edmund and Władysław Zyzak; Ludwik, Franciszek and Władysław Pantofliński; Leonard Rybarski; Otto Szmidt; Wiktor Dubowski and other local youths, passionate about football. Their first opponents were small clubs founded in those years, from Kraków, Lwów, and other towns.
In 1930 the club was promoted to local "A-Class", which roughly is the equivalent of contemporary Second Division. They remained there for four years. 
After World War II, Koszarawa suffered a steady decline. It was not until 2001 that the team gained promotion back to the Fourth Division. They stayed there for a few years until they were promoted once again, this time to the Third Division. In their first season they started brightly, but after the sale of top scorers Krzysztof Zaremba to local giants Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała and Krzysztof Bizacki to GKS Tychy they failed to regain the same form they had had before, and finished in 11th place.

Stott Pilates

Stott Pilates is a contemporary version of the Pilates method of physical exercise. It was developed by Lindsay and Moira Merrithew, with the collaboration of physical therapists, and sports medicine and fitness professionals, to ensure the method stays up-to-date with current scientific and biomechanical research. The most significant difference between Stott Pilates and Joseph Pilates's original method of the early 1900s is that, where the original method uses a straight spine during exercise, Stott Pilates focuses on maintaining the natural curvature of the spine.
Stott Pilates, until 2010, when it merged with Merrithew Health & Fitness, offered Stott Pilates training and certification to instructors at venues on six continents. By 2013, there were approximately 38,000 Stott Pilates-trained instructors in over 100 countries (from the company website), and it commemorated its 25th. anniversary with its "Mindful Movement World Tour".
Stott Pilates is a sister brand of ZEN•GA, CORE athletic conditioning and performance training, and Total Barre.
History.
Following her career as a dancer with the Bermuda Ballet, and principal dancer with the City Ballet of Toronto and the Atlantic Ballet Company, Moira Merrithew learned, with the help of the Dancer Transition Resource Centre, of the Pilates method of exercise. Moira received her Pilates training in New York City from Romana Kryzanowska, a protégé of Joseph Pilates. After her training was complete and her return to Toronto, Moira and Lindsay developed the Stott Pilates method in the 1980s.
At that time, Pilates was very much a cottage industry and access to Pilates exercise equipment was very limited. Lindsay constructed their first piece of studio equipment, called a “reformer.” Early reformers were constructed out of wood, and Moira and Lindsay recognized that the original equipment designs of Joseph Pilates were not adjustable: the exerciser had to adjust to the machine, rather than the other way around. Early in the 1990s, Lindsay set about designing the company’s proprietary line of Pilates equipment, height-adjustable to suit individual users, to work in concert with the Stott Pilates method. Patents were obtained in the US, Canada, and elsewhere for a reformer apparatus and the adjustable reformer, and patents are pending in Australia and Brazil.
Prior to the conclusion, in 2000, of a trademark case about who was entitled to use the word 'Pilates,' Stott Pilates was known as "Stott Conditioning." In 2010, the company name was changed to Merrithew Health & Fitness, but the name of the method remained Stott Pilates.
The company has produced more than 130 instructional Stott Pilates DVDs for both fitness professionals and at-home exercisers.
Principles.
The Stott Pilates method has exercises designed to restore the natural curves of the spine and rebalance the muscles around the joints. The Stott Pilates method places more emphasis on scapular stabilization than other methods. The method focuses on the following five basic principles:
Breathing.
The breath pattern used in the Stott Pilates method involves an expansion of the rib cage out to the sides and back without allowing the shoulders to lift. According to Stott Pilates, it is also important to breathe into the lower part of the lungs, because there is more efficient gas exchange.
Pelvic placement.
Pelvic placement emphasizes stabilization of the pelvis and lumbar spine (lower back) in either a neutral or an imprinted position. Neutral placement maintains the normal curve of the lower back: when lying on one’s back, the front of hip bones and pubic bone lie parallel to the mat, and the lower back is not to be pressed into the mat. While breathing and engaging abdominals in this position, no strain should be felt through the lower back. In an imprinted position, the lower back is moving toward the mat.
Ribcage placement.
The rib cage position affects the alignment of the thoracic (upper) spine. When lying on the back in a neutral position, Stott Pilates practitioners maintain the sense of the weight of the ribs resting gently on the mat (that is, they maintain the normal curve of the upper back). They don't lift off or push the rib cage into the mat, paying particular attention to the placement of the rib cage when inhaling or while performing arm movements overhead.
Scapular movement.
When using the Stott Pilates method, stabilizing the scapulae (shoulder blades) on the back of the rib cage is as important as contracting the abdominals during the initiation of every exercise. This helps avoid strain through the neck and upper shoulders. To achieve proper placement, a sense of width is maintained across the front and back of the shoulders, making sure that the shoulders neither round forward too much nor squeeze together toward the spine; shoulders are not lifted too far, nor over-depressed. Placement is somewhere between these two positions.
Head and cervical spine placement.
Stott Pilates placement of the cervical spine (neck) is such that it holds its natural curve, with the head balanced directly above the shoulders when sitting, lying, and standing. In some cases, a small pillow is used when lying on the back, to put the head and neck in a comfortable position. Whenever exercisers lift the head and upper body from the mat, they lengthen the back of the neck and nod the head forward, without jamming the chin into the chest. This way, there is enough room to fit one’s fist between the chin and chest. Once the head is in proper position and the shoulder blades are stabilized (Principle 4), the upper torso can be lifted by contracting the abdominals and sliding the rib cage toward the pelvis.
Training.
Stott Pilates has grown from teaching the method itself to exercisers (students) to training both instructors and instructor trainers.
Student Training.
In the mid-1980s, Moira and Lindsay set up a small studio in Toronto, Canada. Word of mouth, especially from Karen Kain, long-time principal dancer of the National Ballet of Canada, about the benefits of Moira's instruction led to rapid growth of the business, to the point that it grew into and through four studio premises from 1988 to 2003, until it was large enough to take up an entire floor of a major office tower in Toronto; the current headquarters of the business.
Instructor Training.
In the 1990s, Moira and Lindsay recognized that Moira could not handle all the instruction alone, so Moira started educating trainers in their studio in the Stott Pilates method. They also recognized that there was a demand for teaching the Stott Pilates method outside the studio, so Moira codified the repertoire and started a program on how to teach the method to clients. By the end of the 1990s, trainers from all over the world had graduated from Stott Pilates courses. The 2000s saw a significant growth in the number of Stott Pilates-trained instructors and, in 2013, there were approximately 38,000 students trained in the method, worldwide.
Instructor Trainer Training.
In the 2000s, with so many people both exercising with the Stott Pilates method and trained as instructors, Stott Pilates reached the point where it had to educate selected individuals on how to train interested instructors, so instructor training began. In 2013, there were approximately 250 certified instructor trainers across the world.
Certification.
For an instructor or instructor trainer to maintain Stott Pilates certification, he or she must attend a minimum number of courses and workshops each year; thereby keeping current with the method. Many Stott Pilates courses and workshops are part of the Continuing Education Credit (CEC) programme, and many of them are also recognized by outside organizations, including the American Council on Exercise (ACE).
Licensed Training Centers.
By 2013, approximately 50 fitness centres around the world were licensed to provide training in the Stott Pilates method.
DVDs.
In the mid-1990s, for those without access to a Stott Pilates-trained instructor, and for those who wanted refreshers in the Stott Pilates method, the company started to publish videos and DVDs of most of its programs, and in several languages. Publishing DVDs increased the awareness of the Stott Pilates method as one of the small handful of contemporary versions of Pilates, and was part of what has prompted at least one industry magazine to describe the company as "Industry giant Merrithew Health & Fitness..."
Equipment.
Stott Pilates exercises can be done on the floor using a mat or on specialized equipment. Merrithew Health & Fitness manufactures equipment used for Stott Pilates exercises. The main piece of equipment used in the Stott Pilates method is the Reformer, which has a horizontal carriage that glides forward and backward on rollers. Resistance is provided using springs, along with other attachments for a variety of exercises and positions (i.e., lying down, seated, and standing). The mat exercises may also include props such as the Stability Ball, Mini Stability Ball, Toning Balls, Flexband, Fitness Circle, etc..

Bulls of Donation

The Bulls of Donation, also called the Alexandrine Bulls, are three papal bulls of Pope Alexander VI delivered in 1493 which purported to grant overseas territories to Portugal and the Catholic Monarchs of Spain: 
The bulls were the basis for negotiation between the two powers which resulted in the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, dividing the non-Christian world beyond Europe between them. At first these arrangements were respected by most other European powers, but as the Protestant Reformation proceeded the states of Northern Europe came to consider them as a private arrangement between Spain and Portugal.

Shelby James

Shelby James (born October 29, 1973 in Orlando, Florida USA) was an Amateur American "Old School" Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years were from 1982 to 1990. Starting at age six, it could be said that Shelby James was one of the best racers never to turn pro. From the first year of competition in 1979 he was winning titles. In part due to his large size for his age, he was already 5' 11" by the age of 13 in June 1988 and then 6'1" at 14 years of age, he was one of the most dominatant amateur racers since Richie Anderson (who was also for time larger than normal for his peer group). However, his first love was basketball and always had the intention to become a professional basketball player in the background of his mind. In 1990 after an injury during a race, he quit BMX to pursue that dream.

Retired: In early 1990 after suffering an injury to his chest in a crash at the NBL Easter Classic on April 15, 1990, James retired from BMX to pursue his dream of becoming a professional Basketball player. This was practically confirmed by an April "BMX Plus!" article writing about another racer, Shawn Bone, when he quit the Robinson Products racing team giving up BMX for the Basketball court:

Prestressed structure

Prestressed structure is the one whose overall integrity, stability and security depend, primarily, on a "prestressing". "Prestressing" means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions. 
There are the following basic types of prestressing:
Today, the concept of prestressed structure is widely employed in design of buildings, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, nuclear reactor vessels, and numerous kinds of bridge systems. 
The idea of "prestressing" was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; the tall attic wall of the Colosseum works as a stabilizing device for the wall piers beneath.

Yanartaş

Yanartaş (flaming rock) is the Turkish name of a geographical feature near the Olympos valley and national park in Antalya Province in southwestern Turkey. The location is 80 km southwest of Antalya, near the town of Çıralı. It is generally believed to be the ancient Mount Chimaera. The area is located on a track popular with hikers and trekkers on the Lycian Way.
It is the site of dozens of small fires which burn constantly from vents in the rocks on the side of the mountain. Directly below the fires are the ruins of the temple of Hephaistos, the Greek god who was associated with fire through his role as the blacksmith to the gods. To see the fires and the ruins, visitors must first go to the entrance at the foot of the mountain, where they pay an admission of 4TL. The site is at the top of a one kilometre climb. This is basically a rock stairway and is easily managed. Most people visit at night, when the fires are at their most spectacular. You need to bring your own torch to find your way up the stairs in the dark.
The fires are grouped over an area of 5000 m2 and are fueled by gas emissions which have been burning for at least 2500 years. These emissions seem to change seasonally: vents and flames are more vigorous in winter months. This is a common characteristic of such seeps, where gas flux is typically modulated by gas pressure build-up induced by groundwater recharge and changes in atmospheric pressure.
The vents emit mainly methane (87%). The rest is made of hydrogen (7.5-11%), nitrogen (2-4.9 %), light alkanes (0.57%), carbon dioxide (0.01-0.07 %) and helium (80 ppmv). These proportions and the isotopic composition indicates a mix from 2 origins, in equal part:
These vents represent the biggest emission of abiogenic methane discovered on land so far. Methane is not related to mantle or magma degassing, which excludes the phenomena occurring at Yanartaş be of volcanic cause.
In ancient times sailors could navigate by the flames, but today they are more often used to brew tea.
The site was identified as the ancient Mount Chimaera by Sir Francis Beaufort in 1811, and described by T.A.B.Spratt in his "Travels in Lycia, Milyas, and the Cibyratis, in company with the late Rev. E. T. Daniell." The discussion on the connection between the myth and the exact location of Chimera was started by Forbiger in 1844, and the George E. Bean was of the opinion that the name was allochtonous and could have been transferred here from its original location further west, as cited by Strabo, owing to the presence of the same phenomenon and the fires. 
"Yanartaş" is also the title of a 1970 novel by the Turkish novelist Mehmet Seyda. It is not associated with this location.

Ardagh railway station

Ardagh was a station which served Ardagh in County Limerick, Ireland.
History.
The station was opened by the Waterford and Limerick and Rathkeale and Newcastle Junction railways, then absorbed into the Great Southern and Western Railway. In 1924 the Railways Act passed by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State moved the station to the "Great Southern Railway". In 1925 another merger led to management by the Great Southern Railways. Then it was moved to the CIE by the Transport Act 1944 from 1 January 1945, on nationalisation. .The station closed under this management.

Tramping in New Zealand

Tramping, known elsewhere as hiking, rambling, hill walking or bushwalking, is a popular activity in New Zealand.
Tramping is defined as a recreational activity involving walking over rough country carrying all the required food and equipment. The term is generally used for trips that are of at least one overnight stay in the backcountry.
History.
Alpine climbing as a recreational activity was taken up in the early days of European settlement and tramping became popular with the widespread use of motor vehicles. From the 1950s tracks, huts and bridges were built in the forested areas of New Zealand to allow easy access for hunters to cull the introduced deer which had become a threat to the biodiversity of New Zealand. As tramping became popular these facilities were increasingly used by trampers. In later years tramping has become popular for both local and foreign tourists.
Tramping clubs were formed in many towns, cities and universities with regular trips being organised. The clubs sometimes own a bus to transport club members to the tracks.
Tramping tracks.
A network of tramping tracks has been developed throughout New Zealand of varying length and difficulty. A small number of tramping tracks cross private land either in part or in full. All of the major tramping tracks are on public land that is administered by the Department of Conservation. 
Huts.
There is a network of over 950 backcountry huts throughout New Zealand operated by the Department of Conservation (DOC) on public land. Some areas have privately owned huts on public land used for commercial tourism operations. The majority of the huts were built by the now defunct New Zealand Forest Service for deer culling operations. Other huts were built by alpine clubs, schools, ski clubs. Some of the buildings on public land that are readily accessible by vehicle, are generally "baches" or "cribs" built by private individuals when control of the use of public land was less stringent. These baches are not made available to the public. 
Some public huts are associated with a local club and volunteers from clubs will perform much of the maintenace on these huts. In the Tararua Forest Park north of Wellington huts are managed in a partnership between DOC and various lower North Island clubs. In the eastern Southern Alps near Christchurch some huts are managed solely by the Canterbury Climbing Club and they rely on fees from these huts to help pay the cost of maintenance. 
Amongst experienced trampers there is a strong culture of looking after huts. The phrase "hut etiquette" encompasses looking after any hut that is used and showing consideration for other hut users. Most huts on the conservation estate are open to the public and the state of a hut depends on the care by those who use it.

This environmental care code promoted by the Department of Conservation contains a 10 point checklist of things that can be done in the outdoors to help minimise impact:

Jakob Haibel

Jakob Haibel (20 July 1762 Graz – 24 March 1826 Đakovo) was an Austrian composer, operatic tenor and choirmaster.
Biography.
Around 1789, Haibel joined Emanuel Schikaneder's company of performers at the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden. While there, he acted in plays and sang in operas and other musical productions. In the mid-1790s he started composing incidental music for company's plays and writing singspiele. His first score for the company was the ballet "Le nozze disturbate", which premiered in 1795 to great success. The company performed the work 39 times that year alone. Beethoven based his 12 variations on a "Menuett à la Vìganò" WoO 68 (1795) on an air from the ballet. In 1796, his opera "Der Tiroler Wastel" premiered at the theater to rave reviews. The work was Haibel's greatest success and was given 66 times that year and 118 times in all at the Freihaus-Theater. The work was staged in a multitude of other theatres throughout the Austro-German part of Europe and no other original score by Haibel ever equalled its success.
Haibel continued to compose music for the theater until the death of his first wife Katharina (ca. 1768 – Vienna, 14 February 1806). In the fall of 1806 he left Vienna for Diakowar (Đakovo), Slavonia, and spent there the rest of his life as the cathedral choirmaster. Recent research has brought to light 16 Masses by Haibel written during this time, preserved in the Kuhač collection at the Nacionalna i Sveučilišna Knjižnica in Zagreb. He became Mozart's posthumous brother-in-law when he married Sophie Weber, Constanze's sister, on 7 January 1807. After Haibel's death in 1826, Sophie moved to Salzburg to live with her sister.

Landsort, is a Swedish village and a lighthouse on the island of Öja. The tower was built in 1689, with an upper conical iron section added in 1870. Open fires have been lit here since a long time ago.
The first "real" lighthouse was lit in 1651 and, until the now-standing tower was built, a couple of different buildings were used as the lighthouse. The 1689 tower was constructed to carry an open fire which ran on coal. In 1840, a colza oil lamp was installed. The flame ran on paraffin from 1887, and in 1938 it was electrified. Today the Swedish Maritime Administration owns and runs the lighthouse.
Landsort traditionally marks the southernmost point of the Stockholm Archipelago.

Dianella was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia from 1977 to 1983 and again from 1989 to 1996.
The district was based in the northern suburbs of Perth.
History.
Dianella was first contested at the 1977 state election. The seat was won by Labor candidate Rev Keith Wilson, who became the first clergyman to win Parliamentary office since changes to the electoral laws a few years earlier which lifted a ban on them. The seat was renamed Nollamara two terms later, ahead of the 1983 state election. 
Dianella was created as a new seat further south from its original incarnation for the 1989 state election, with Wilson successfully transferring to the seat, serving also as Minister for Health under Premiers Peter Dowding and Carmen Lawrence. He was defeated one term later at the 1993 state election by Liberal candidate Kim Hames. The seat was abolished ahead of 1996 state election and split between the seats of Maylands and Ballajura, with the suburb of Yokine in the electorate's west being transferred to the new seat of Yokine. The final member, Kim Hames, contested and won the latter.

"Palaeoglaux" is a genus of fossil owl from the Eocene epoch. There are two known species, "P. perrierensis" from the Upper Eocene of Quercy, France and "P. artophoron" from the Middle Eocene Messel shales, Germany. The holotype of "P. perrierensis" is a partial left coracoid in the Collection Université Montpellier, accession number PRR 2585. There are four paratypes; the distal part of a left humerus (PRR2591), the proximal part of a left ulna (PRR 2571), the distal part of a left ulna (PRR 2578) and the distal part of a right tarsometatarsus (PRR 2576). The type specimen of "P. artophoron" are a fossil slab and counterslab containing most of the postcranial skeleton and some feather impressions. This specimen is in the collection of the Forschunginstitut Senckenberg, accession number SMF-ME 1144 A and B.
The feathers of "P. artophoron" show some unique characteristics. The feathers on the trunk are about wide and long. They appear to be membranous and ribbon-like, without barbs This may be an artifact of preservation, but eight nearby primaries show barbs quite clearly. Peters noted that ribbon-like, elongated plumes are known from some living birds, but all are used in display. He writes that display feathers are unexpected in a nocturnal owl, and wonders if this lineage of owls was, in fact, diurnal.

Felice Lattuada (5 February 1882 - 2 November 1962) was an Italian composer.
Lattuada was born at Caselle di Morimondo, near Milan. In his early adulthood he worked as a school teacher and was a self-taught amateur composer. That changed when he entered the Milan Conservatory in 1907. He studied composition there under V. Ferroni for five years, graduating in 1912. Among his works are several orchestral and chamber music pieces written in a strongly lyrical and expressive character derived from the late-Romantic tradition. He also wrote several works for the stage including "Don Giovanni", which won the "Concorso Nazionale della Pubblica Istruzione" in 1928. Lattuada was director of the Civica Scuola di Musica in Milan from 1935 to 1962. His son Alberto Lattuada (1914−2005) was a well-known film director, and the two collaborated on several projects during the 1940s. Lattuada's film scores were often more traditional in nature as opposed to his son's more innovative approach to film direction.
He died in Milan in 1962.

<doc id="19251942" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19251942" title="Service assurance">
Service assurance

Service assurance, in telecommunications, is the application of policies and processes by a Communications Service Provider (CSP) to ensure that services offered over networks meet a pre-defined service quality level for an optimal subscriber experience. 
The practice of service assurance enables CSPs to identify faults in the network and resolve these issues in a timely manner so as to minimize service downtime. The practice also includes policies and processes to proactively pinpoint, diagnose and resolve service quality degradations or device malfunctions before subscribers are impacted. 
Service assurance encompasses the following:
There are many drivers for service assurance adoption, with some considering the most important to be the ability to measure the performance of a service. A subscriber’s service experience quality can be directly linked to churn. Therefore, maintaining satisfactory service quality levels is key to creating “customer stickiness.” 
Other factors driving growing interest in service assurance include increasing competition, new challenges due to the convergence of networks, services, applications and devices, enabling services over IP and the merging of IT and telecommunications services. But ultimately, it is the CSP’s ability to ensure a satisfactory level of QoS that will have the greatest impact on revenue. 
The importance of service performance is also reinforced by research stating that two thirds of subscribers will stop trying a new service after two failed attempts with that service. Therefore, it is increasingly apparent that service assurance tools must be put in place prior to the introduction of a new service if it is to be successful in the market. This is particularly true of deployments of such services as VoIP, IPTV and mobile video.
Service assurance spending by CSPs is forecast to grow to $USD 3.0 billion by 2011. Leading global service assurance providers include nsn, EXFO, Anritsu, Epitiro, Spirent, JumpSoft, Computer Associates, Astellia, EMC, InfoVista, Telcordia, Tektronix, Agilent, HP and IBM.

Service fulfillment

Fulfillment of telecommunications services involves a series of supply chain activities responsible for assembling and making services available to subscribers. These activities delineate an operational infrastructure whose efficiency relies upon its ability to allow a communications service provider (CSP) to match the supply of services with demand in an economical way and with consistently high levels of quality and reliability.
To achieve these goals, the design of service fulfillment platforms take into consideration the following:
Processes.
The supply chain activities in service fulfillment involve the following processes:
Subscriber expectations.
Keeping up with increasing subscriber expectations in today's market is not the exclusive domain of service assurance. Service fulfillment plays a critical role as well in ensuring a "first time right" customer experience.
Customer satisfaction in the telecommunications industry stems from adequate service provisioning, value for money, loyalty and relationship management. An efficient service fulfillment platform automates service order processing to gain speed via flowthrough capabilities and to reduce the service order fallout that results from manual processes. This is being recognized by CSPs as they increasingly look to their suppliers for help in achieving higher levels of automation.
Service fulfillment vendors.
Notable global service fulfillment vendors include Sigma Systems, Cisco, Open International, Telcordia (now part of Ericsson), TIBCO, Amdocs, Oracle, NetCracker, Comptel, HP, Tecnotree, Arkipelago and Ericsson.

Statistical Analysis Center

Statistical Analysis Centers (SACs) are state agencies created by legislation or Executive Order that collect, analyze, and disseminate criminal and juvenile justice data. They contribute to effective state policies through statistical services, research, evaluation, and policy analysis. 
SACs are nonpartisan and strive to serve all branches of the criminal justice system and all levels of government in a state as well as the general public. Objectivity, independence, and visibility are important considerations in determining their placement in the state government. SACs are located in a variety of different settings in the states; the majority are a component of the state justice administrative or planning agency. For those located in an agency with line responsibilities in the criminal justice system (e.g. State Police, Department of Corrections, Office of the Attorney General), special provisions are needed to ensure the SACs’ broad mission, objectivity, independence, and visibility. SACs are staffed by professionals skilled in the application of statistical methods and techniques, who are familiar with the factors, issues, and processes involved in crime and the criminal justice system. Currently, there are SACs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Most of the state SACs receive funding support from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice as well as other offices within that agency. Nationally, the SACs are represented through a membership organization, the Justice Research and Statistics Association, a private, nonprofit agency.

Integrated flowthrough

Integrated flowthrough, in telecommunications, refers to the disciplines and techniques by which a Communications Service Provider (CSP) may achieve and maintain high levels of automation, efficiency and accuracy in operational processes such as fulfilment and assurance.
Typically, this involves optimization and integration of various Operations Support Systems (OSS) or Business Support Systems (BSS) as well as structuring and optimizing the activities of personnel involved in handling order fallout, with the goal of both reducing the number of orders that “fallout” and require manual handling and reducing the time and effort required to handle orders that do fallout.
The growth in the order management market is due to CSPs having higher expectations about guaranteed order completion times, thus making issues such as the management of order fallout a priority for CSPs. (Order fallout occurs when the progression of an order has been or rejected, resulting in the order not being successfully completed.)
While many CSPs have spent decades on continuous improvement to achieve high levels of order flowthrough for traditional services, many find that converged, triple-play or quad-play operations environments require renewed focus on this discipline due to the increased complexity of orders in this environment.
Integrated Flowthrough employs a methodology that blends the service design, network technologies, OSSs, fulfillment and assurance processes, enabling CSPs to examine assurance and fulfillment operations from every dimension, including leadership, people processes, technology and systems/data.
Integrated Flowthrough can help CSPs realize the following benefits:

Dinwiddie High School

Dinwiddie High School is a secondary school in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, USA. It is the only high school in the county.
History.
The Mann Act in 1906 provided for a system of high schools across the state. High schools were eventually built for white students in the county at:
Midway (1911 - 1965),
Sunnyside (1912 - 1930),
Dinwiddie (1913 - 1965), 
Darvills (1914 - 1942), 
McKenney (1916 - 1930). 
These were all consolidated into Dinwiddie County High School in 1965.
Campus.
In 2008, Dinwiddie High School moved to a new building located on a campus across the street from its former building. The new school building serves students in grades 10 through 12 with a capacity of 1,600. The move is intended to ease overcrowding and accommodate future population growth in the region. The former high school building is now Dinwiddie Junior High School for grades 8 and 9. Both schools are nicknamed the Generals, or the Gens. Although the two schools are separate, many authorities have confirmed the actual closeness of the students in the junior and senior high schools. Therefore, this makes it impossible to split the two schools. The campuses' close proximity allow for the sharing of amenities such as the football field.
Athletics.
The Dinwiddie High School Generals went to the 2001 Virginia State Championshop at UofR Stadium against Hertigage Newport News, losing 42-7
The Dinwiddie High School Generals went to the 2008 Virginia State Championship at Lane Stadium against the Phoebus High School Phantoms, losing 37-13.
The Dinwiddie High School Generals went to the 2013 Virginia State Championship at Williams Stadium against the Sherando High School Warriors, winning 56-14.

Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec

The Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ, often pronounced "ram-q" by French and English speakers alike) is the government health insurance board in the province of Quebec, Canada. The no longer official English name is Quebec Health Insurance Board.
Under the system, most residents of Quebec have basic health coverage. There are a few exceptions, such as college or university students from other provinces who are covered by their home province plans.
The Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec was established in 1969 for the purpose of setting up the public Health Insurance Plan. Ever since, the Régie has contributed to the development and smooth operation of Québec's healthcare system.
There are 7.4 million holders of this card issued by RAMQ. The card was first implemented by Quebec's Health Minster Claude Castonguay in 1970, considered one of the key persons in the establishment of public medical insurance and healthcare in Canada.
The Board issues a Health Insurance Card to persons eligible for the Québec Health Insurance Plan. Because the Health Insurance Card gives access to insured healthcare services, it is important for insured persons to carry their card with them at all times.
Information appearing on a Health Insurance Card.
1. The bar code, found on the cards issued as of January 11, 2010.
2. The Health Insurance Number, unique to each person, consisting of:
3. The person's identity:
4. The person's birthdate and sex.
5. The year and month of expiry.
6. The person's photograph and signature, both of which are digitized and incorporated into the card. Cards issued to persons not required to provide a photo and a signature, such as children under age 14, have no photo or signature spaces, while cards issued to persons exempt from providing their photo, their signature or both, are marked "exempté" in the appropriate space(s).

President's Putter

The President's Putter is an annual golf competition contested between former and current Blues golfers from Oxford and Cambridge universities. The event is held every January at the Rye Golf Club in Rye, East Sussex with the first tournament held in 1920. Those eligible to play are current and former alumni of the universities who are members of the Oxford & Cambridge Golfing Society, thus the golfers are usually amateurs and ages may vary between 20 and 70+ years. The tournament is played by scratch match play and the winner receives a silver medal in exchange for his or her winning ball, i.e. the ball with which he or she last played in the final - this ball is then attached to the Putter by means of a silver band and a silver chain. The 3 different Putters bearing the winners' golf balls are on permanent display in the clubhouse at Rye GC. Past winners include five time tournament winner Roger Wethered, Cyril Tolley and Charlie Rotheroe. Rotheroe won his third tournament in 2008. 
The President's Putter itself was first given to the Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society by John Low and it originally belonged to Hugh Kirkaldy. When this Putter was "full" and could accommodate no more balls, a second Putter was introduced; this belonged to Laurie Auchterlonie. The third and current Putter was brought into use in 1983 and was made by Open Championship winner Willie Park, Snr..

Toivo Harjunpää

Kalle Toivo Immanuel Harjunpää (; 2 June 1910 – 21 September 1995) was Finnish-American Lutheran priest and professor.
Background.
Harjunpää was born in Rauma, Finland. Harjunpää was ordained to priesthood 18 February 1936 in Turku Cathedral. His background was in the Finnish "Evangelical Revivalist Movement", originating from the activity of neo-Lutheran priest Fredrik Gabriel Hedberg. As a young priest while learning the New testament, he was convinced of the importance of Christian ecumenism which was unpopular at that time in Finland. Soon after that Yngve Brilioth's book "Eucharistic Faith and Practise. Evangelical and Catholic" and Hans Liezmann's "Messe und Herrenmal" gave him more direction towards the Ecumenical Movement and Liturgical Movement. 
Career.
After short curacy in Vehmaa and a job in the student union of his revivalist movement, Harjunpää became pastor of Finnish Seamen's Mission in London 1938-45, and the secretary of archbishop Aleksi Lehtonen from 1945 - 1948. Together with Martti Parvio he founded a High Church circle which was informally referred to as "Liturgical Brethren".
In May 1948, Harjunpää immigrated to the United States. He became a teacher in Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1953 and was professor of church history of the Graduate Theological Union from 1963 until 1977 until his retirement. He was member in many Lutheran commissions on Hymnology and liturgy. He was also member of Societas Sanctae Birgittae.

Edward Loder

Edward James Loder (10 July 1809 – 5 April 1865) was an English composer and conductor. His best remembered work is perhaps the 1855 opera "Raymond and Agnes", though his most successful opera during his lifetime was "The Night Dancers".
Biography.
Loder was born in Bath, Somerset. He was the son of John David Loder (1788–1846), a violinist and musical director of the Theatre Royal, Bath, and his wife Rosamund, née Mills (1787–1856), a step-daughter of the comedian John Fawcett. Edward Loder's twin brother John Fawcett Loder (1809–1853) was a violinist, and a younger brother William Sowerby Loder (1812–1851) was a cellist who married the soprano Emily Woodyatt. His cousins included the composer and conductor George Loder (1816–1868) and George's sister, composer and pianist Kate Loder.
Loder's family sent him to Frankfurt in 1826 to study under Ferdinand Ries, who was an old friend of the family. He returned to England in 1828 and embarked on a successful career as an opera conductor in London as the music director of Princess's Theatre, and, from 1851 in Manchester, leading the Theatre Royal. His first composing success was "Nourjahad" in 1834. His compositions include operas, cantatas, ballad operas, string quartets, and many songs. Today he is most remembered for his opera "Raymond and Agnes" (1855), which was revived in Cambridge in 1966. His most successful opera during his lifetime was "The Night Dancers", sometimes referred to as "The Wilis, or The Night Dancers", or "Giselle, or The Night Dancers", first produced in 1846 and revived at Covent Garden in 1860. 
On 10 November 1831, Loder married Elizabeth Mary Watson (c.1813–1880) at Bristol. It appears they were separated within a few years, as in 1861 he stated that his wife was Louisa Alice Foster, born c. 1838. He appears to have fathered a son (Edward Loder Garside 1850-1940) with the actress Clara Garside Neville (1827–1869) during his marriage to Louisa. Tributes at the time of his death state that he was a bachelor.
He died in London in 1865.

Managed evolution

Managed evolution, in telecommunications, is a process by which a Communications Service Provider (CSP) may deploy and use new network or software technologies in concert with existing network assets, Operations Support Systems (OSS) and/or Business Support Systems (BSS) for technical or financial benefit, while investing in and deploying New Generation OSS (NGOSS).
Managed Evolution leverages methodologies, expertise, and technology tools that focus on building a single or federated view of data across all network layers (e.g. OSI Model) and services. Typically, a single system has responsibility for stewardship of data and federates only the necessary data to systems serving other layers or domains. The approach is designed to reduce risk, lower operations expenses, improve time-to-market and enhance the overall end-user experience.
Typically, CSPs evaluate the following business areas when following a managed approach to evolution. These areas commonly span financial, technical, human resource and business process concerns and include:
Managed evolution applies to any new technology initiative that seeks to leverage existing assets. This could include using SONET/SDH networks to provide Metro Ethernet or using a mix of copper and optical access facilities to deliver Fiber to the x (FTTX) broadband services, as examples.

Mount Barrow

Mount Barrow is a mountain located north east of Launceston, Tasmania. The mountain habitat is a mixture of temperate old growth rainforest, subalpine and alpine landscapes.
It is the closest alpine mountain to Launceston and the plateau extends to and reaches a maximum altitude of above sea level, making it the second highest peak in eastern Tasmania. The road to the summit is periodically closed in winter due to snow, with the snow line located at around metres.
A state reserve on Mount Barrow occupies and is an important habitat for several threatened species. These include the Tasmanian Wedge-tailed Eagle, the spotted-tail quoll and Eastern quoll and the Mount Arthur Burrowing Crayfish. Marsupials regularly sighted on the mountain include wombats, pademelons, Bennett's wallabies and Forester kangaroos.
Numerous mountain streams are found across the escarpment and these can turn into substantial waterfalls after heavy snowfall.
Mount Barrow is the main television and FM radio transmission site for north east Tasmania. The broadcasting and telecommunication structures are subject to ice build up and have shields incorporated into their designs to prevent damage from falling ice. Due to the rugged terrain the programme reaches the sites via microwave links instead of the usual fiber optic cables. Electrical power reaches the facilities by an overhead line running up the eastern side of the mountain.

William Bradbery

William Bradbery (11 July 1776 – 11 August 1860), an entrepreneur, was the first person in England to cultivate and sell watercress on a commercial basis.
Early life.
William was born in Didcot in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), he was one of seven children to Thomas and Catherine Bradbery. In 1796 he married Phoebe Whiting in Marcham, Berkshire. Until around 1805 he stayed in the Marcham area, then they moved to Springhead, Northfleet in Kent, where he first started to cultivate watercress.
Watercress cultivation.
In an article by Henry Bellenden Ker, F.R.S. in 1822, to the London Horticultural Society. He states, "I lately found that watercress is grown in this neighbourhood, by Mr. William Bradbery, for the purpose of supplying the London markets. Mr. Bradbery first began to cultivate the watercress in February 1808, at Northfleet Spring Head, near Gravesend. For this purpose, he procured young plants, and placed them, with a small proportion of the wet earth in which they grew, in shallow running water; the plants soon formed large tufts, and rapidly spread over the water; and he then gathered the cress regularly for the London markets".
"Mr. Bradbery now having left Northfleet last year (1820),began to plant, at a considerable personal expense, beds of the cress, at West Hyde, near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. Mr. Bradbery has about five acres of lakes planted with cress. He sends the cress in hampers, each containing eight dozen bunches, to the London markets, every day throughout the year, except Sundays; three days in each week to Covent Garden market, and the other three days to Newgate market. This cultivation of the watercress has insured a constant and regular supply to the metropolis, and the gatherings are received much fresher, and more regularly packed, than those obtained from plants in the wild state; where little selection is made as to the quality, or attention paid to the state of the vegetable, which is usually sent up to town in sacks, and often much bruised and broken before it reaches the retail dealer".
West Hyde proved to be an ideal place to grow the cress, as water bubbled to the surface in a line of springs. The water containing suitable minerals which assisted the growth of the cress. By the mid-19th century, William Bradbery was sending cress to many cities throughout the country, being, Manchester, Liverpool, York, London, Oxford even up to Edinburgh. In the 1841 census return, William described himself as a "Market Gardener", employing 22 workers from West Hyde and surrounding area. He even sent cress to the Great Exhibition of 1851, at The Crystal Palace.
Retirement.
Now residing in some style, he and his wife lived at Corner Hall, in West Hyde, the family home for over 75 years. Having created a substantial business for himself and his family, William retired in his sixties, and let his son Job take over the running of the business, who in turn passed it onto his son, Richard.
William died on 11 August 1860, a little over a month before his wife Phoebe, who died on 19 September 1860. They are buried together in the churchyard of St Thomas, in West Hyde.
The watercress business continued on in the ownership of the Bradberys for some years after William died. Richard the grandson,it seems,lacked the same entrepreneurial spirit and drive of his grandfather William. So in 1927, after over a century of cress production, the watercress beds were sold off to another local grower, thus ending the Bradbery dynasty in West Hyde.
Recognition.
In 1960, the "Three Rivers District Council", marked the achievements of William and his family, by naming one of the roads in nearby Maple Cross ""Bradbery"". This was also done in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, less than four miles (6 km) away, where they named a street ""Bradbery Gardens"", where William's eldest son Richard, also ran a watercress farm, to complement the one in West Hyde.

Russia–Trinidad and Tobago relations are the bilateral relations between the Russian Federation and Trinidad and Tobago. Diplomatic relations were established on June 6, 1974. Russia is represented in Trinidad and Tobago through a non-resident embassy in Georgetown, Guyana.
Soviet-era relations.
Premier of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev sent a telegram to Eric Williams, the incoming Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, on 30 August 1962 recognising the independence of Trinidad and Tobago from the United Kingdom. In the same telegram, which was sent only hours before the formal independence from the United Kingdom, the Soviet Premier also expressed his willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the new Caribbean nation.
Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Trinidad and Tobago were established on 6 June 1974 in New York City, when the Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations Yakov Malik and his Trinidadian counterpart signed thed necessary treaty. Vladimir Kazimirov was appointed as the first Soviet Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago, in concurrence with his posting as Ambassador to Venezuela, on 19 April 1975. Kazimirov presented his Letters of Credence to Governor-General of Trinidad and Tobago Ellis Clarke on 13 June 1975.
In 1975, Eric Williams travelled to the Soviet Union as part of a thawing of relations between his country and Soviet-aligned states.
Russia and Trinidad.
In August 1992, Trinidad recognized Russia as the successor state to the Soviet Union. In 2004, Sergey Lavrov and Knowlson Gift signed a protocol on political consultations between the two ministries. In April 2005, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago signed a cooperation agreement. In 2004, the Russian Cossack folk dance had nine concerts in Port of Spain, San Fernando, Couva, and Tobago. 
In December 2010, Suruj Rambachan, the Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister announced that the country had one month previous lifted visa requirements for holders of Russian passports. Rambachan stated that the move, under which holders of those passports would be able to visit Trinidad and Tobago for 90 days visa-free for either business or pleasure, was done to make it easier for those nationals to do business in the country, and to also increase tourism, in which he noted that Russian tourism to Tobago has been increasing.

Imerman Angels is a United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides a free, one-on-one cancer support service for cancer fighters, survivors, and caregivers. It is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
The organization partners a cancer patient (fighter) with a "Mentor Angel"- a cancer survivor who has beaten the same type of cancer. A Mentor Angel gives the fighter hope because they are living proof that cancer can be beaten. Imerman Angels also connects caregivers, those who support cancer patients, with patients in need.
The relationships give a fighter the chance to ask personal questions and receive support from a survivor, who is uniquely familiar with the situation. Peer support is an important component of palliative care, which aims to improve the quality of life for people facing serious illness.
History.
Imerman Angels was founded in 2003 by Jonny Imerman, a testicular cancer survivor, who noticed how many people fought cancer alone, without the support of family and friends.” Imerman saw the value in providing a service enabling a cancer fighter to talk to a cancer survivor, who not only had beaten the same type of cancer, but who also was the same age and gender as the fighter. Today, Imerman Angels helps the cancer community make these connections.
Leadership.
The Imerman Angels 2012 Board of Directors consists of: John May (Chairman), Jason Canner, MD, Noel Hara, Caralynn Nowinski Chenoweth, M.D., Dr. Gregory Roslund, MD, FACEP, FAAEM, Stacy Stone and Ryan W. McCain.

The now standing tower (built in 1870) replaced an older tower which was built in 1840 on top of an old fortress. The flame ran on colza oil. In 1887 the colza oil lamp was replaced with a kerosene lamp. It got electrically powered in 1948.
The Swedish Maritime Administration owns the lighthouse. In the summer of 2008 SMA reported that the white main light had been deactivated.

Xosé Manuel Beiras

Xosé Manuel Hixinio Beiras Torrado (born 7 April 1936) is a Galician politician, economist, writer and intellectual. He is professor of Structural Economy at the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of Santiago de Compostela. Former member of the National Council of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG in the Galician acronym), he is at present leader of ANOVA-Irmandade Nacionalista, an independentist political party with representation in the Galician parliament.
Academic life.
Beiras graduated in Law in 1958 at the University of Santiago de Compostela. That same year he moved to Paris to study economics. He also studied French literature at the University of the Sorbonne (1960). In 1961 he joined the London School of Economics to further expand his knowledge on the field of economy. In 1966 he completed a research course on economics with François Perrou at the Institut de Sciencie Economique Apliquée (Paris). While in France, he became acquainted with Robèrt Lafont's concept of "internal colonialism", a concept that would embed his political discourse in the years to come.
He was the vice-director of the "Revista de Economia da Galiza" ("Galician Journal of Economics") from 1963 to 1968. In 1967 he was granted with a prize from "Casa Galiza" of New York for his book "O problema do desenrolo na Galiza rural" ("The Problem of Development in Rural Galicia"). In 1968 he moved back to Galicia permanently, where he took up a job as lecturer in economy at the University of Santiago de Compostela. In 1970, while spending a few months in Madrid, he published his doctoral thesis with the title "Estructura y problemas de la poblacion gallega" ("Structure and problems of the Galician population"). This thesis granted him the post of associate-professor in Structural Economy.
In 1972 he published one of this key works: "O atraso económico da Galiza" (""The Economic Underdevelopment of Galicia""), and he was offered the post of temporary Dean, a position he eventually accepted in 1975. While still publishing books, he directed a research project on the modernization of Galian agriculture sponsored by the Pedro Barrié de la Maza foundation and the University of Montpellier. In 1977 he was invited to join the "Real Academia Galega" ("The Royal Galician Academy") – the institution he would leave in 1982 as he disagreed with the linguistic policies endorsed by the Academy (and following the example of Carvalho Calero). In 1980 he became head professor of Structural Economy at the University of Santiago de Compostela, where Beiras still remains today. The 1980s were prolific in publications not just related to economics or politics, but also literary. He would even publish translations from French classics into Galician.
Life in politics.
As a politician he was one of the founding members of the clandestine Galician Socialist Party, in 1963, still during the Franco dictatorship. In 1964 he took on the role of International Relations, a position which would grant him access to a number of European Socialist organizations. He would eventually become Secretary General of the party in 1971. Yet, he resigned in 1977 due to the bad results in the first democratic elections of Spain after the death of Franco.
In 1982 Beiras takes part in the foundation of the BNG (Galician Nationalist Bloc) as member of the National Directive Board. In 1985 he gained a seat at the Galician Parliament and gradually became the indisputable leader of Galician nationalism. Beiras took the party to its best results ever in 1997, receiving the support of almost 25 per cent of the electorate. In 2004 he established a number of pacts with nationalist parties from Catalonia and Basque Country in order to gain greater media coverage and, most importantly, joint political weight in the Spanish Parliament. That same year, 2004, he decided to renounce to the candidacy for the Galician presidency for the next elections and gradually leaves active politics. However, being unhappy with the internal dynamics of BNG shortly after he yielded leadership, he fostered a critical organization within it - the "Encontro Irmandinho" - in order to promote party transparency and internal democracy.
After abandoning the first line of BNG, Beiras has been actively involved in anti-globalization movements such as Altermundo and the World Social Forum (WSF) In 2008 he was invited to join the Council of the WSF [http://firgoa.usc.es/drupal/node/40670/print. Beiras is also the co-founder and president of the politically oriented foundation "Galiza Sempre", since 1999.
Beiras as an author.
He has published a large number of books and articles in politics and economics, but as an intellectual Beiras has also shown an interest in literature and music (he is an accomplished pianist). He contributed to the creation of publishing houses such as Editorial Galaxia and Edicións Laiovento. At present he is a regular columnist of newspaper "Galicia Hoxe". Occasionally he publishes in the newspaper "A Nosa Terra" and in the prestigious Galician cultural journal Grial.

Salvatore (band)

Salvatore was a Norwegian instrumental rock band influenced by post-rock, electronica and kraut-rock that was formed in 1998, lasting until 2008. 
History.
The band was founded in Oslo in 1998 by John Birger Wormdahl together with Ola Fløttum, Bjarne Larsen and Kjell-Olav Jørgensen. A session of listening to German kraut-rock band Neu! provided the impetus for the formation of the band.
The band was among the winners of the Norwegian music contest Zoom in 1998 and as a winner went on a Zoom-tour in Norway, England and Scotland in the spring of 1999. 
In 2000 they recorded their debut album "Clingfilm" . During easter of 2000 the band traveled to Morocco with the Norwegian theater group "De Utvalgte" (the Chosen Ones). In Morocco they recorded the albums "Jugend - A New Hedonism", recorded as the soundtrack to the theater group's production of "The Picture of Dorian Gray". The band releases "Clingfilm" in October and "Jugend" in November 2002 on the record label Racing Junior.
Jon Platou Selvig joins the band in 2001 and the album "Fresh" is released in October. In 2002 the percussionist Karim Sayed joins the band. 
Their fourth album "Tempo" was recorded in Chicago by John McEntire and wins the Spellemannprisen 2002 award for best record in the electronica genre. In the same year Salvatore also participated in the Earworm compilation "A Charabang Trip To The Lights".
Their fifth album "Luxus" was recorded in Oslo in 2003 by Ingar Hunskaar and is mixed by John McEntire in Chicago in 2004. In 2003, Ola Fløttum leaves the band and "Fresh" is licensed and released by the San Diego label Rocketracer. 
In 2004 Jørgen Skjulstad joins Salvatore and the band embarks on their first European tour in January. In April "Luxus" is released and they tour Europe in June as a supporting band to Tortoise. In 2005 the band goes on tours to Germany, Austria, Italy and the Balkans; Jon Platou Selvig quits the band and Leon Muraglia joins the band.
In 2007 Salvatore releases "Days of Rage", their sixth and last album, on New Year's Day. Anthony Barratt joins the band prior to the release. "Days of Rage" goes on to win Spellemansprisen 2007 award, again in the electronica genre.
After ten years, the band chooses to dissolve itself in June 2008, due to the logistical problems of co-coordinating an ever changing and increasing band membership and a feeling that they were not progressing creatively anymore.
Three of the four original members, John Birger Wormdahl Bjarne Larsen and Kjell-Olav Jørgensen, have formed the band Masselys.

Real time policy

Real time policy, in telecommunications, is a technical capability used to implement a wide array of business rules and subscriber preferences. While the genesis of policy was in Quality of Service (QoS) and congestion control, it has evolved as Communications Service Providers (CSPs) use it to create personalized, user-directed and interactive services and implement business objectives.
Real-time policy enables CSPs to follow the trend of “mass customization” to hyper-tailor services and customer experiences in real time, tailoring news delivery, content screening rules, display preferences, pricing, among other options, to fit every individual preference, requirement, and lifestyle. 
Drivers for the roll-out of real-time policy functionality include:
Examples of real-time policy include:
Market Adoption.
kajeet utilized real time policy to become one of the first service providers to launch a mobile service aimed at preteens, featuring an array of parental control features. Large CSPs such as T-Mobile have followed suit based on market demand.
Role In Advertising.
Real time policy’s role controlling the delivery of interactive advertising is being explored in the TM Forum’s Content Encounter, which aims to make seamless, communications, information and entertainment services a reality.

Charles Dickens wrote this about the room during the administration of John Tyler:
went upstairs into another chamber, where were certain visitors, waiting for audiences. At sight of my conductor, a black in plain clothes and yellow slippers who was gliding noiselessly about and whispering messages in the ears of the more impatient, made a sign of recognition, and glided off to announce him. We had previously looked into another chamber fitted all round with a great bare wooden desk or counter [probably the Anteroom, today's Treaty Room, whereon lay piles of newspapers, to which sundry gentlemen were referring. But there were no such means of beguiling the time in this apartment, which was as unpromising and tiresome as any waiting-room...
Because the East Sitting Hall is situated above the East Room (which has a 22-foot ceiling), access to the East Sitting Hall was originally by way a small set of stairs from the Stair Landing. During the Truman reconstruction, the room was reduced by the addition of a lavatory and side stair to the third floor; the steps were replaced with a ramp through an arched corridor.
Sister Parish, the first interior designer brought in to decorate during the Kennedy restoration, created the original concepts of the redesigned East Sitting Hall, which became a repository of furniture and memorabilia associated with the life of President James Monroe.

Kids (MGMT song)

"Kids" is the third single from MGMT's album "Oracular Spectacular". It was released as a single on October 13, 2008.
The song was the center of a legal dispute with the former President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, over the "insulting" compensation he offered for his illegal use of the song during a party conference.
"Rolling Stone"'s Kevin O'Donnell described the song as, "a noisy New Order-style synth jam".
The version that appears on "Oracular Spectacular" is updated from earlier versions that appear on the group's EPs "Time to Pretend" (2005) and "We (Don't) Care" (2004). A track entitled "Kids (Afterschool Dance Megamix)" appears on the album "Climbing to New Lows" (2005).
On December 1, 2009, the track was announced as a nominee at the 52nd Grammy Awards in the category Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals.
Reception.
To date, the single has peaked at #9 on the US "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart, where "Time to Pretend" had previously peaked at #23.
"NME" named it the number-one song on its list of the Best Singles of 2008. In October 2011, "NME" placed it at number 99 on its list "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years". "Rolling Stone" named it #46 on its list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s.
Two months after exiting the UK Top 40, the song was featured in an advertisement for the BBC1 program "Waterloo Road". From this the song gained renewed interest, re-entering the UK Top 40, and on January 16, 2009, the song reached its highest position to date of #16.
"Kids" came in at #5 on Australia's Triple J Hottest 100 countdown for 2008. In 2013, the song was voted at #64 on the same station's Hottest 100 from the past 20 years.
The single received considerable airplay in the U.S., UK, Ireland and Australia before the release date, charting in the UK, Ireland and Australia. In Australia, "Kids" debuted before the release date at #89, and currently it has peaked at #30, playing on radio stations like Nova. A Soulwax remix of the song was played heavily on UK radio ahead its official release as well.
The song got to the number one spot on the Norwegian chart, based on downloads alone. This made some controversy about how reliable the chart was, as the song had not been playlisted on any major radio stations and it disappeared from the chart the next week.
In Chile, the song peaked at the #130 of Chilean radio Rock & Pop "20 Años 200 Canciones".
Use in media.
Kids was selected for the soundtrack for the video game "FIFA 09". The song was also featured in the Quiksilver and Red Bull snowboarding film, "That's It, That's All", as the final song in Taylor Steele's surf movie "Stranger Than Fiction", in episode 6 the BBC's "Survivors", as the trailer song in the documentary "American Teen", a trailer for Channel 4 show "Big Art", the skiing film "Reasons", the 2008 film "American Teen", in the second episode of "Paris Hilton's British Best Friend", and in season 2 episode 19 of "Gossip Girl", "The Grandfather". The song has also made appearances as background music in the fourth and fifth series of the BBC One British drama "Waterloo Road", on the BBC Three show "The Real Hustle" and in the Staples Center at X Games XV. It is also featured in the pilot episode of "The Vampire Diaries", played near the end of the 2009 film "Whip It", and in the fifth episode of the third season of "The Secret Life of the American Teenager". In the seventh series of "Shameless", part of the song was briefly played in one of the episodes. On the Nokia's website, they promoted their newest phone, the Nokia N8. In all videos (commercials and introductions to features), "Kids" was remixed by Nokia and played.
It is also featured prominently in the documentary "Tapped", about bottled water. It plays during several scenes near the end and over the credits. The song is also played in the trailer for the film "Africa United" and may be used in the sound track. In Argentina, the movie-channel Volver use the intro of the song for the Advertising Space ("Inicio y fin de espacio publicitario" in Spanish). It was also featured on the television series "Jon & Kate Plus 8".
Legal proceedings.
MGMT was involved in a legal dispute with the former President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy's UMP party used the song on several occasions, before offering the band a €1 gesture. The band commented that "We believe that access to music benefits both the musicians and the fans, and has undoubtedly helped spread our music around the globe, while also expanding our personal musical collections" and that the reason they felt compelled to sue was because "the fact that the UMP used our song without permission while simultaneously pushing anti-piracy legislation seemed a little wack". Eventually, UMP reached an agreement on a €30,000 (US$38,000) settlement fee.
Music videos.
Student assignment video.
A video made by University of Southern California student Jon Salmon was created in December 2007 as a student assignment and uploaded to YouTube the following month. The video features fellow students Abby Fuller and Rafael Pulido lip-syncing to the song and frequently cuts to various clips from other YouTube videos featuring people dancing. It has since been viewed more than 47 million times on YouTube (link), over twice as many times as the viewership of the official video. MGMT later invited the participants to join them for the official video of "Electric Feel".
Official video.
On June 3, 2009, MGMT released the official music video for "Kids". It was directed by Ray Tintori, who directed MGMT's previous videos for "Time to Pretend" and "Electric Feel." The video was released to the "Oracular Spectacular" version.
The video follows a toddler menaced by monsters that his inattentive mother (played by Joanna Newsom) cannot see. It begins with a quote ostensibly from Mark Twain, on a background of fire. The quote at the beginning of the video attributed to Mark Twain is actually a quote from Nietzsche's "Beyond Good and Evil". Then, with pictures of kids, crudely designed numbers counting from 5 to 1 appear. After that, we see the toddler in his crib. Suddenly, monsters show their claws at him. He is then picked up by his mom and she walks out of her house, then down the street, while the child sees humans as bloody monsters. His inattentive mother then places him down and he begins to walk down the street, and then begins to cry and run in fear of the monsters. We then see the toddler smile as he comes across the band performing the song in futuristic spacefarer costumes. The toddler gains a headband with "MGMT" on it just for watching them. A policeman with a bloodied face grasps the child and carries him to his mom, who throws the headband down, thus ending his only chance of happiness in the video. As the mother drives him home, the toddler sees monsters and a creepy sheepdog outside and in a DVD. Suddenly everything becomes animated and the van is revealed to be a scab on a naked woman. The toddler tries to run but his body parts disappear and then his head explodes into hot dogs. Various surreal things begin to happen in the animated world. The boy appears again and his eyelashes grow large and more strange things happen, including multicolored ghosts and a pig in a ballet outfit. The pig is knocked out by flying sandwiches, pizza and ham and the child is chased by a zombie in a hoodie, then climbs onto the hand of a giant Andrew VanWyngarden (the toddler believes he is really reunited with his mother). VanWyngarden explodes, and the boy spins around in darkness.
The video has been criticized for its treatment of the toddler who appears to be truly frightened throughout the video, though it is stated on the MGMT website "No children were harmed in the making of this video." In addition, the band released a "behind the scenes" video through its official YouTube channel that shows the toddler laughing while interacting with the puppets and actors in monster costumes. The animated sequence was done by Christy Karacas, director of the "Superjail!" TV series, as well as Henry Thurlow and Lizzi Akana.
The YouTube video has received over 25 million views.
The video was critiqued on the ninth season premiere of "Beavis and Butt-head", "Werewolves of Highland".
Cover versions.
An acoustic version of "Kids" was recorded by The Kooks in August 2008, to appear on the next volume of Triple J's cover compilation "Like a Version". Another acoustic version by Australian singer Ben Lee appears on the bonus CD from his 2009 album "The Rebirth of Venus". Cage the Elephant covered the song as a b-side to their 2009 single Back Against the Wall. DJ AM and Travis Barker also used the song on their mix tape album "Fix Your Face Vol.2: Coachella 09". Sebastian Ingrosso sampled the song in his 2009 house song, "Kidsos".
The song has been covered live by Weezer (in a medley with "Poker Face" by Lady Gaga), Chiddy Bang, The Moth and the Mirror, Mac Miller, Dr Fox's Old Timey String Band, Jack's Mannequin, Our Lady Peace, Lady Danville, B.o.B VIC, A Modest Proposal, Matt Hires The Neon Rush, andCage The Elephant.
In 2010, the funereal doom/death band Ankhagram from Russia did a unique cover of the song on their 2010 full-length album, entitled "Where Are You Now."
As well as performing the song live, Chiddy Bang also sampled the song in "Opposite of Adults" from their mixtape "The Swelly Express".

Lava cave

A lava cave is any cave formed in volcanic rock, although in typical usage it is reserved for caves formed by volcanic processes, which are more properly termed volcanic caves. Sea caves, and other sorts of erosional and crevice caves, may be formed in volcanic rocks, but are unrelated to volcanic processes and typically form long after the volcanic rock was emplaced.
Types.
There are many types of lava caves, with these being the most notable:

Russ Westover

Russell Channing Westover (March 8, 1886 – May 3, 1966) was a cartoonist best known for his long-run comic strip "Tillie the Toiler".
Westover was born in Los Angeles, California. He recalled, "When the time came... to make a living, father put me in one of the stores he owned. I used to wrap parcels, and I'd draw pictures on them. The customers liked it, but my father didn't. We talked it over and came to an agreement. I went into the railroad business." 
After a job as a clerk with the Southern Pacific Railroad, Westover headed for San Francisco, where he studied at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. After four months, he dropped out after an instructor said, "Young man, the drawing of Caesar is good, but that caricature you made of me on the border is terrible".
He was 18 years old when he landed a job as a sports cartoonist with the "San Francisco Bulletin". He also contributed to the "San Francisco Chronicle", the "San Francisco Post" and the "Oakland Herald". His first comic strip, "Daffy Dan", about a baseball player, was published in the "Post".
Comic strips from New York.
Relocating to New York, he was at the "New York Herald" when he drew his first nationally syndicated strip, "Snapshot Bill" (1914), followed by "Ginger Pop", "Fat Chance", "Looie and His Tin Lizzie" and "The Demon Demonstrator". He also worked as an illustrator for "Life" and "Judge" (1918–21).
"Tillie the Toiler" begins.
Westover worked on his concept of a flapper character in a strip he titled "Rose of the Office". With a title change to "Tillie the Toiler", it sold to King Features Syndicate. Leaving the "Herald", he began "Tillie the Toiler" for King Features in 1921, and the working-girl strip quickly established a wide readership, leading to a 1927 film adaptation by Hearst's Cosmopolitan Pictures with Marion Davies as Tillie. 
During the late 1920s, more than 600 papers were carrying "Tillie The Toiler". In 1926, he added another strip, "The Van Swaggers", to his Sunday page as a topper. Cupples & Leon published a series of at least eight "Tillie the Toiler" reprint collections beginning in the 1920s and continuing into the 1930s. Westover profited from another movie when Kay Harris appeared in the title role of Columbia Pictures' "Tillie the Toiler" in 1941. 
When Westover retired in the early 1950s, Bob Gustafson continued "Tillie the Toiler" until 1959. 
Westover was 80 when he died in 1966 in San Rafael, California. His work is archived at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

Jardin botanique exotique de Menton

The Jardin botanique exotique de Menton (11,000 m²), also known as the Jardin botanique exotique du Val Rahmeh, is a botanical garden located off Avenue St Jacques, Menton, Alpes-Maritimes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France. It is open daily except Tuesday; an admission fee is charged.
The garden can be traced back to 1875 when the De Monléon family constructed the property. In 1905 Lord Percy Radcliffe, former governor of Malta, with his spouse Rahmeh acquired the property, adding adjacent farmland to form a garden. In 1957 Miss May Sherwood Campbell acquired the property and a second garden, now accessed by a bridge, and created a pond with water hyacinths, water lilies, and papyrus. In 1966 she donated her property to the nation, which transferred it to the Ministry of National Education. It then became a research center for Mediterranean flora managed by the National Museum of Natural History. The garden opened to the public in 1967. 
Today the garden contains some 1,500 taxa growing within a microclimate of high humidity where temperatures rarely fall below 5°C (41°F) in winter. It features "Sophora toromiro" (a species of small trees since disappeared from Easter Island), as well as exceptional olive trees (more than 400 years old) and collections of exotic plants including palm trees, chorisia, datura, and lotus, plus fine collections of citrus, olives, and palm trees. Rare species include "Aloe marlothii", "Araucaria columnaris", "Castanospermum australe" (Moreton Bay chestnut), "Cnicothamnus lorentzi", and "Ficus religiosa". A small rainforest area contains bamboo, gingers, philodendrons, tropical fruit trees, and a path through spices and herbs. The garden also contains an excellent "Musa basjoo" and a two "Chorisia speciosa" specimens.

Él (record label)

él is an English independent record label founded by Mike Alway and part of Cherry Red Records.
Alway, who cut his teeth in the late seventies working with The Soft Boys and promoting clubs and concerts in Richmond, south-west London, joined Cherry Red Records in 1980 to work alongside the company's founder, Iain McNay. 
Over the next few years he signed many of the artists who would become most closely associated with the label — The Monochrome Set, Felt, Everything But The Girl, Marine Girls, Fantastic Something, Eyeless in Gaza etc. This was widely recognised as a golden period for the label, culminating in the release of "Pillows & Prayers", the budget priced compilation that encapsulated the label's emerging style. It dominated the then prestigious UK independent charts in 1983. 
Alway then misguidedly (by his own subsequent admission) formed the Warner Brothers-backed Blanco Y Negro with Geoff Travis of Rough Trade, taking several Cherry Red artists with him, notably Monochrome Set and Everything But The Girl. The relationship with Warners did not gel, however, leading to a return to the Cherry Red family and the high concept él Records, which he had founded as a subsidiary outlet while at Blanco, became his new focus. él combined the technicolor exoticism of Powell and Pressburger with the escapist fantasy of The Avengers. The stylised visual aesthetic of The Prisoner with the dry-witted late seventies British television comedies The Good Life and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. Richard Briers and Leonard Rossiter were, to Mike Alway, what Malcolm McLaren was to Alan McGee.
él's playful humour and highly visual aesthetic spoke to the Japanese and was a significant influence on the J-Pop phenomenon that involved Cornelius, Pizzicato Five and Kahimi Karie. Indeed, él and Alway were immortalised in Kahimi Karie's domestic top ten hit, "Mike Alway's Diary", that was written by the high priest of "J-Pop", Keigo Oyamada.
Although Alway had recruited a cast of performers he would describe as the best English pop writers of their generation — Vic Godard, Bid (The Monochrome Set), Karl Blake (Shock Headed Peters), Jessica Griffin (Would-be-goods), Victor Armada (Mayfair Charm School), Nick Currie (Momus), Philippe Auclair (Louis Philippe) and former Jonathan King teen prodigy Simon Turner (The King of Luxembourg), critical acclaim was not matched by sales and in 1988 the project was abandoned. 
In 2005, él reinvented itself (again under the Cherry Red flag) with Alway applying his eclectic taste to the restoration of historic editions; film soundtracks, jazz and flamenco guitar, Brazilian and Indian recordings, vocal and Modern Classical music

<doc id="19252712" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19252712" title="Fulcrum Gallery">
Fulcrum Gallery

History.
The artist-oriented, artist-designed (by Tery Fugate-Wilcox) gallery was first located in a space at 144 Mercer Street, under the Guggenheim Museum, SoHo. It was most notable for unusual exhibitions: paintings made by the rain, of water-soluble paint; paintings of living grass; dwarf apple trees that grew into glass sculptures; living hermit crabs that moved into glass shells; a forest of two inch, by eight foot, clear tubes,(hanging from the ceiling) containing water and one living plant each; paintings made with rust or fluffy gold, silver and copper leaf, (unburnished); drawings of dust on white canvas; and soot from candles or debris from explosions.
Artists Talk on Art.
Fvlcrvm Gallery was home to ATOA, (Artists Talk on Art), a non-profit organization that held public forums, panel discussions and open screenings for and about art and artists, every Friday night, at the gallery.
Panels at the gallery included such notables as Christo and Jean Claude, Tery Fugate-Wilcox, Leon Golub, Arthur Dantos, Larry Rivers, Holly Solomon, Chuck Close, the Andy Warhol Foundation, Hilton Kramer and Ivan Karp, of O.K. Harris Gallery on subjects like ""Come on. What's it really Worth"," (how art gets its value); ""Two Camels for your Canvas"," (on bartering); ""The Art Wars: Actual vs. Virtual"", (Actual Art versus Virtual Art); ""Art Virgins"", (collectors on their first art purchases) and ""Art & Ethics"", (ethical decisions artists face). ""Why'd You Make That?"" (moderated by Tery Fugate-Wilcox with Chuck Close, on the artist's reasons behind making art).
Gallery Ads and Publicity.
Shakespeare's Fvlcrvm Gallery became notable in the art world for its outrageous artist-designed ads by Tery Fugate-Wilcox in "Art Now Gallery Guide" and "Art in America". The ads were shown by Robert Miller Gallery, as art. The ads were usually accompanied by a series of controversial articles in the "Gallery Guide" by gallery owner Valerie Monroe Shakespeare, including "Plaza Plop", ""Artists of the Aughts"", ""Shock Schlock"", ""Dirt, Dust, Rust & Smut"".
After the exhibition at Robert Miller Gallery, publisher of "New York Arts" Magazine chose one of the photographs for the cover of their next issue. Valerie Shakespeare's nude torso was to be featured on the cover. The publisher, Abe Lubelski asked Tery Fugate-Wilcox to design the cover. His design is shown below. After stating he was "thrilled with the design" Lubelski asked Fugate-Wilcox to include thin profiles on either side of Shakespeare's image, of Mayor Juliani and Hans Haake, so that the magazine could cash in on a major controversy, at the time, over an artwork, "Nazi Garbage Cans", Haake was showing in the Whitney Museum, as a parody of the Mayor's conflict with the sanitation union.
, Lubelski then took it upon himself to reduce Shakespeare's figure to a circle, placed in the center of a Nazi flag, without Tery's or Ms. Shakespeare's permission, sparking a lawsuit, which became an episode on "Peoples' Court" in Nov. 2000.
One ongoing exhibition at Shakespeare's Fvlcrvm included an all glass beehive, by Robert Dugrenier, which sat in the gallery's front window, with a tube to the outdoors, for the bees to seek out all the rooftop gardens, returning to make wax and honey sculptures inside the hive, programmed by the artist to take the desired form. Many SoHo residents came in to thank the artist for enabling their gardens to bear fruit for the first time. The bees were covered by CNN, in a 4-minute spot that aired all over the world, HBO, Art Now Gallery Guide, New York City Guide, the New York Times, Where Magazine and New York Magazine.
WNYW's "Good Day New York" did its entire show, with Julie Golden, live from Fvlcrvm Gallery on March 9, 1995 and the movie "Great Expectations" used Shakespeare's Fvlcrvm Gallery in one of its scenes. 
The gallery's exhibitions were also featured on NY1, for Earth Day, during and exhibition of grass "paintings" by Maria Ceppe.
CBS, WNYW, NBC, and ABC, covered, along with the New York Times, art exploded in the street by Tery Fugate-Wilcox on Chinese New Year despite a ban on explosives by Mayor Giuliani.
The owner, Valerie Shakespeare was interviewed during the huge Chinese dinner party, open to the public, and asked what she thought of the Mayor allowing a SoHo art gallery to set off explosives, while banning the same for all of Chinatown, breaking their 5000-year-old traditions? Ms. Shakespeare was seen on all the networks, saying, "I think it stinks!"
Shakespeare's Fvlcrvm Dinners.
Fvlcrvm gallery began, like all other galleries, having "regular" openings with tiny cups of white wine. But being raised in Arizona, Shakespeare's sense of hospitality moved her to offer food as well. After a particularly crowded opening, for which she had cooked all day, she noticed the neither she, nor none of her artists, staff or collectors had gotten anything to eat. As she sat in a restaurant, buying dinner for over 30 people, she wondered, "What's wrong with this picture?" So began her signature sit-down dinners every week, for friends and supporters of Actual Art.
In 1997, Fvlcrvm Gallery moved to a two-level space, complete with outdoor sculpture garden for art to weather, and a firepole, at 480 Broome Street, in SoHo. This gallery was also artist-designed, by Tery Fugate-Wilcox.
The gallery continued at the Broome Street location, where the installation of a full kitchen permitted the gallery's weekly sit-down dinners to be expanded for 35 to 45 people and the occasional buffet party for hundreds, including the dinner party for Chinese New Year, with art by Tery Fugate-Wilcox, that was blown up on the street, complete with fireworks and a dragon for the celebration, during a ban by Mayor Rudy Giuliani on explosives, and a Nude Portrait Marathon with Barneby Ruhe making conventional paintings of nude models, while Tery Fugate-Wilcox had living nudes standing in huge frames on the walls of the gallery. Some of the most notable works at the new location included: a glass behive, by Robert DuGrenier; a 55 gallon glass tank of water that grew slime and algae, by Tery Fugate-Wilcox; steel drawings made by rusting etched steel plates in a studio under the sea.
There, the gallery became well known in the artworld, for its sit-down dinner parties, every Tuesday night, which Shakespeare cooked herself and served on an ever-expanding long table, down the center of the gallery. The dinners were "intimate affairs for forty or fifty people", including such celebrity guests as Michael Kennedy, Mary McFadden, Robert De Niro, Robert Goulet, Eric Douglas, John De Lorean, John Kennedy and his wife, Caroline, many of whom bought art, supported the gallery or just loved to "hang out".
In addition, Shakespeare's Fvlcrvm always had an ongoing exhibit of the San Andreas Fault Sculpture Project, by Tery Fugate-Wilcox, in its own space, complete with model, maps of the proposed site, plate tectonics information, seismic graphs, stereoscopic aerial photographs of the entire San Andreas Fault, taken by practice runs of the U2 spy planes, on special maneuvers, requested by the Geologic Survey.
The gallery closed in 2002, when the effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks effectively closed down SoHo. Although the gallery struggled to keep its doors open, especially since several of its staff were living in the gallery, after they were made homeless by the collapse of the twin towers, the inability, coupled with unwillingness of clients to fly into New York City in the aftermath of the tragedy, finally caused Fvlcrvm Gallery, along with many other galleries and businesses, to go out of business and close its doors permanently.

Thalassophobia

Thalassophobia (Greek: "thalassa", "sea" and φόβος, "phobos", "fear") is an intense and persistent fear of the sea. Thalassophobia is a clinical phobia generally classified under specific phobias, fear of a single specific panic trigger. Symptoms for thalassophobia are the same as for most specific phobias.
Although it is a clinical phobia, it often accompanies other anxiety disorders. In some cases anxiolytic medications may be prescribed or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) may be indicated.
Although many people are nervous when on a ship, this phobia is not one of the most common. People with Thalassophobia fear being in large bodies of water. A common case of fear of the ocean is sometimes triggered by fearing the thought or sight of any creature under the depth of any body of water, not just directed toward oceans.
Many people with this phobia fear what lies beneath them, mostly sea creatures.

El Verger

El Verger (, Spanish: ) is a town of 4,992 inhabitants situated 3 kilometres from the Mediterranean sea and 8 kilometres from Dénia, in the Comarca of Marina Alta, Land of Valencia, Spain. The main attractions are the Main Street, two medieval towers, a neoclassical church and a safari park. The town's crest, recently resuscitated, pays homage to its name: it displays two trees and four flowers.
Geography.
The municipal boundaries confront those of Beniarbeig, Benimeli, Murla, Dénia, Ondara and Els Poblets. The town is 91 km from both Alicante and Valencia, and constitutes part of the frontier between the Province of Alicante and that of Valencia. The Mediterranean is 3 kilometres to the northeast. The town is split in two by the river Girona, which flooded catastrophically in 2007, destroying many houses and taking a life. The largest part of El Verger is to be found on the western side of the river, and three bridges provide access to the other side and to the sea beyond. Behind El Verger lies the Segària mountain range, a place popular for hiking and which gives the local school its name. A large part of the surrounding lands is dedicated to agriculture, specifically vegetables and citrus fruits.

Amb l'expulsió dels moriscos el 1609, quedà quasi totalment despoblat. Com la majoria del País Valencià, després de dita expulsió els nous pobladors vingueren en gran part de les Illes Balears, generalment Mallorca i especialment a la Marina. Tal casualitat explica els trets mallorquins al parlar de la zona.
El 12 d'octubre del 2007, fortes pluges que superaren els 400 mm, causaren el riu Girona de desbordar-se. Aquesta riuada destrossà 80 cases al llarg del riu al seu pas per El Verger, arribant als dos metres d'alçada a alguns carrers. Fou el major creixement documentat del Girona, deixant els ponts malmesos i la mort d'una persona.
Demografia.
La població actual és de 4.839 habitants.
Cultura.
La biblioteca municipal es troba a l'antiga estació de trens, just darrere de l'ajuntament. Té un assortiment de llibres i revistes tant en català com en castellà, i ofereix accés gratuït a internet.

Hi ha unes quantes colles de músics, i una de dolçainers de molta fama.
La llengua del Verger és el català. Segons els censos de la Generalitat de 1991, 97,9% ho poden entendre, 87,8% el saben parlar, 63,2% el saben llegir i 30,4% el poden escriure.
Festes.
El Verger és conegut per les seues festes, especialment els Moros i Cristians del 12 al 15 de l'agost. Cal esmentar també la Nit de les Paelles, a la qual colles s'acampen al carrer i preparen paella a l'engròs, i Bous al Carrer, una correguda de bous al carrer Major. D'altres festes i esdeveniments són les dels patrons (la Mare de Déu del Roser, Sant Roc i Sant Isidre), les Carrosses, el mercat medieval i la fira dels comerços. A vora del riu, hi ha una zona d'esplai amb paellers.

Comerços i serveis.
Hi ha molts comerços al Verger, destacant-hi els bars i cafés, botigues de roba i de baix preu, papereria, i magatzems de material d'obra. Té dos supermercats: "Mas y Mas" i "Aldi". Al polígon comercial, al nord del poble, es pot trobar bastants magatzems de material i articles domèstics.

Croatia v United States (1990)

On October 17, 1990 Croatia hosted the United States in an international friendly in Zagreb's Maksimir stadium. This was Croatia's first international match.
Background.
With the abolishing of the one-party political system in SFR Yugoslavia in 1990, SR Croatia's (constituent republic within the Yugoslav federation) first parliamentary elections were held over two rounds of voting on 22 April and 7 May 1990 resulting in an overwhelming victory for the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) led by Franjo Tuđman. With the rising nationalism and ethnic tensions, several incidents took place at football matches in SR Croatia over the coming months.
Only six days later, on Sunday, 13 May 1990, a riot broke out at Maksimir Stadium during a Yugoslav First League match between the Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb and the Serbian club Red Star Belgrade. Dinamo midfielder 21-year-old Zvonimir Boban attacked a policeman and got a 6-month suspension by the Yugoslav FA (FSJ), causing him to miss the 1990 FIFA World Cup as well as the pre-tournament friendlies. 
At one of those friendlies on 3 June 1990 versus Holland at Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb (Yugoslavia's last preparation match before the World Cup) local Croatian fans booed the Yugoslav anthem and players, while cheering for the opposing Netherlands side which won the match 0-2. 
On 26 September 1990, several weeks into the following Yugoslav League season, another incident broke out, this time in Split. Hajduk Split's home match against Partizan Belgrade at Poljud Stadium was cancelled after local fans stormed the pitch, chased Partizan players off, tore down the Yugoslav flag from the official mast and burned it.
Game.
The United States was on a tour of Europe where the team was already scheduled to play Poland. Croatian businessman Jure Klarić financed the $90,000 needed for the Americans to subsequently travel to Zagreb.
The exhibition took place on October 17, 1990. The match took place at the same time as the final of the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, in which several young Croatian talents played for Yugoslavia (Zvonimir Boban, Davor Šuker, Robert Jarni, Igor Štimac, Robert Prosinečki and Alen Bokšić). The exhibition was permitted by the Croat secretary of the Football Association of Yugoslavia, Ante Pavlović, who suspended the decision of the association's own committees regarding the match.
Despite conflicting with the Yugoslav juniors' match in the European finals, the match drew 30,000 spectators. Croatia won the match 2-1. The match was officiated by a group of Italian officials consisting of Sergio Coppetelli, Dario Boemo, and Giancarlo Dal Forno, with the Croat Atif Lipovac being the fourth official.
The match marked the debut of the Croatian national team's checkered jersey, designed by Miroslav Šutej who also designed the modern Flag of Croatia and the banknotes for the Croatian kuna.

Stalin's ten blows

Stalin's ten blows (Also Stalin's ten victories, Ten victories of the Red Army, rus. Десять сталинских ударов) is a term for ten successful strategic offensives conducted by the Red Army in 1944. The Soviet offensives drove the Axis forces back from positions held near Leningrad, Belarus, and Ukraine to Poland and Central Europe.
History of the expression.
The term was heard for the first time in November 1944 from Joseph Stalin in his speech "27th anniversary of the Great October socialist revolution" () during the 1944 meeting of the Moscow's Soviet deputies. The term was coined as a reflection of the "cult of personality" that prevailed in Soviet Union at the time. It did not reflect specific strategic planning of the Stavka, and at times had been called the "Year of twelve victories," based on the order issued by Stalin on the following day, authorizing the firing of artillery salutes with 24 guns in twelve cities of the Soviet Union: Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Petrozavodsk, Tallinn, Riga, Vilnus, Kishinev, Tbilisi, Sevastopol, and Lvov.
The term was discontinued in use after Nikita Khrushchev's Secret speech denouncing Stalin and ending his "cult of personality" following his death.
Background.
After the collapse of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-offensives and the Battle of Kursk later in 1943, it became apparent that the tide of war was turning against Germany. Soviet forces were, all along the front, approaching the pre-war border. Partly because of Führer Directive No. 51, which funneled all new men and materials to the Western Front, to meet the expected Allied Invasion, issued on 3 November 1943, Axis forces along the Eastern Front were severely inadequately equipped in comparison to their Soviet opponents, reinforcements were rare, and reserves were stretched thin. Although in this directive Hitler implied that he might be willing to allow withdraws, trading space for time, this proved to be false. This, combined with Hitler's insistence on holding onto captured territory at all costs, made Soviet victories in 1944 nearly inevitable.

Rudolf Wagner-Régeny

Rudolf Wagner-Régeny (28 August 1903, Szászrégen, Austria-Hungary (now Reghin, Romania) – 18 September 1969, Berlin) was a composer, conductor, and pianist. Born in Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary, since 1920 Romania, he became a German citizen in 1930, and then East Germany after 1945.
From 1919–1920 he studied at the Leipzig Conservatory. In 1920 he enrolled at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik as a student of Rudolf Krasselt and Siegfried Ochs for conducting, and for orchestration of Emil von Řezníček, and with Friedrich Koch and Franz Schreker for composition, graduating in 1923. He served as chorusmaster at the Volksoper Berlin from 1923–1925. In 1927 joined Laban's dance company where he conducted productions for three years.
Wagner-Régeny first gained notice as a composer with his theatre pieces for Essen. In 1929 he met the designer Caspar Neher, who wrote the texts for Wagner-Régeny's best-known operas. In 1930 Wagner-Régeny became a naturalized German citizen, and married, his wife being half-Jewish. Between 1930 to 1945 he worked as a freelance composer and teacher, and with the rise of the Nazis was promoted by a faction of the party as a composer of the future despite the stylistic closeness of his music to the proscribed Kurt Weill. He managed to gain the friendship and esteem of Baldur von Schirach and his works were performed by Karl Böhm and Herbert von Karajan. However, the success of his opera "Der Günstling" (after Georg Büchner, Dresden, February 20, 1935) was followed by doubts regarding his subsequent output, ending in a scandal with his opera "Johanna Balk" at the Vienna State Opera (April 4, 1941), which aroused the ire of Joseph Goebbels. As punishment, Wagner-Regény was drafted into the military in 1942 (or 1943), though he managed to secure a desk job in the army, and survived the war.
After the close of World War II, Rudolf Wagner-Régeny opted for East instead of West Germany. He was director of the Rostock Hochschule für Musik from 1947 to 1950. In 1950 he was appointed as a professor of composition at the (East) Berlin Hochschule für Musik and at the Academy of Arts. He continued to work there until illness prevented it in 1968.
As a composer, Wagner-Regény wrote numerous symphonic works and chamber works. He composed 12 operas of which "Die Bürger von Calais" (1936, libretto by Neher), "Johanna Balk" (1938), "Das Bergwerk zu Falun" (1958, after ETA Hoffmann) (cf. "The Mines of Falun") and "Prometheus" (1959) are considered his best work. His 1958 ballet "Tristan" is also greatly admired. He struggled to find a musical language distinct from the extremes of modernism but without any association with fascist aesthetics. His early compositions were inspired by Busoni, Kurt Weill and Schoenberg. His theatre collaborations with Neher and Bertold Brecht were also of importance for the development of his style. After composing works along traditional lines, he adopted his own 12-note serial technique in 1950. In their transparency and austerity, his stage works follow the music theatre of Weill and Hans Eisler and somewhat parallel those of Boris Blacher.

Roy Swinbourne

Royston Harry "Roy" Swinbourne (born 25 August 1929 in Denaby Main, Yorkshire) is an English former footballer who played as a centre forward in the Football League for Wolverhampton Wanderers. He was capped once by England B.
Career.
Swinbourne began his career at Wath Wanderers, the Yorkshire-based nursery club of Wolverhampton Wanderers. He moved south to join Wolves in 1944 and signed as a professional the following year.
After proving himself in the reserve ranks, he made his debut on 17 December 1949 in a 1–1 draw with Fulham. He came to the fore during the 1950–51 season, replacing Jesse Pye in the attack, and finished as top goalscorer with 22 goals. Injuries waylaid him the following year, but in the next campaign, forming what was described as "a potent dual spearhead" with Dennis Wilshaw, he was once again the club's leading scorer with 21 goals.
His tally of 24 in the 1953–54 season was a career best and helped Wolves capture their first ever league championship. It was Swinbourne himself who scored twice in the final game, a 2–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur that confirmed the title. The following season brought another strong return, including two goals in Wolves' famous floodlit victory over Honved of Hungary.
In 1955 he scored for England B in a 1–1 draw against their German counterparts: His career was halted when he damaged his knee while hurdling over a posse of cameramen on the pitchside at Luton Town's Kenilworth Road ground in November 1955. After trying to return just weeks later, he was forced to undergo surgery on the injury. He was never able to resume his playing career and was forced to announce his retirement in May 1957.
He lives in retirement in Kinver, Staffordshire.

Bungamati

Bungamati is a village development committee in Lalitpur District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal. Bungamati or Bunga: (called by local people in Newa: (Nepal Bhasa) language ) or Amarapur (an old name) is a classic Newa: village dating from the 6th century. 
The first stele of Amshuverma was found in Bungamati dated sambat 29 or 605 AD where the first mention about Kailashkut Bhavan was found. The stele further shows that Bungamati had already been a famous village for agriculture, livestock and fishing. Bugayumi was name of the village in Lichhavi period and it changed to Bungapattan in Malla period. It is perched on a spur of land overlooking the Bagmati river. 
Bungamati is the birthplace of Rato Macchindranath,regarded as the patron of the valley and the large Rato Macchindranath, shikhar-style temple in the center of the village square is his home for six months of the year(he spends the rest of his time in patan). The process of moving him around patan and backward and forward to Bungamati Central to one of the most important annual festivals in the valley. 
The chowk around the temple is one of the most beautiful in the valley-here one can see the heart of a functioning Newa: town. In Bungamati the Karya Binayak temple is also one of the most important temples in Nepal, is dedicated to Ganesh, the view is spectacular from the Karya Binayak, surrounding by trees and large bamboos and can look at the Bagmati valley to the foothills.
The Macchindranath Temple:
The central ritual focus of Bungamati is the Temple of Macchindranath. To the villagers, Macchindranath is known by the name “Bungadeya”; the name is derived either after the village founded at the spot where Bhairav howled “bu” (birthplace), or from the word “Bungaa:” meaning “watering place” or “spring” like the explanation of the name of the village and several residents in Bungamati offer the second derivation. Bungadeya has many important mythological, historical and contemporary ritual associations with water.Bungadeya being a primordial rain god, who was later identified with the benevolent Aryavalokiteshvara. Macchindranath is also known by the name of “Karunamaya” meaning an embodiment of love and kindness like a mother figure. While Bungamati Newa: people refer to Macchindranath as Bungadeya, Newah from other parts of the valley use the name Karunamaya to refer to Machendranath.
Machendranath’s identity as Padmapani, Lokeshvara, and Aryavalokiteshvara is widely known.
The another important part of historical importance in Bungamati is the living goddess KUMARI. generally people only know there are only three kumaries as kathmandu, patan and bhaktapur but in patan near its area there is also a living goddess kumari in lalitpur bungamati where the god rato machhindra nath and karyabinayak (ganesh) temples are located as having their own importance.

<doc id="19253132" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19253132" title="Emirate of Granada">
Emirate of Granada

The Emirate of Granada (, trans. "Imarat Gharnāṭah"), also known as the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada (), was an emirate established in 1238 following the defeat of Muhammad an-Nasir of the Almohad dynasty by an alliance of Christian kingdoms at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. After Prince Idris left Iberia to take the Almohad leadership, the ambitious Mohammed I ibn Nasr established the last Muslim dynasty on the Iberian peninsula - the Nasrids. The Nasrid emirs were responsible for building the Alhambra palace complex. Arabic was the official language and mother tongue of the majority of the population.
Tributary State.
With the Reconquista in full swing after the conquest of Córdoba in June 1236, Mohammed I ibn Nasr aligned Granada with Ferdinand III of Castile in 1238, thereby creating a tributary state, or "taifa", under the Crown of Castile. Granada remained a tributary state for the next 250 years, with Nasrid emirs paying tribute to Castilian kings mostly in the form of gold from present-day Mali and Burkina Faso that was carried to Iberia through the merchant routes in the Sahara. The Nasrids also provided military assistance to Castile for its conquest of areas under Muslim control, most notably Seville in November 1248 and the Taifa of Niebla in 1262..
In 1305, Granada conquered Ceuta, but lost control of the city in 1309 to the Kingdom of Fez with the assistance of the Crown of Aragon. Granada re-captured Ceuta a year later, but again lost it in 1314. Granada again held the city from 1315 to 1327. In 1384, Granada again re-took Ceuta but lost it definitively in 1387.
Granada's peace with Castile broke down on various occasions. Granada lost territory to Castile at the Battle of Teba in 1330. In 1340, Granada under Yusuf I supported the failed Marinid invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which ended at the Battle of Río Salado.
Regional Entrepôt.
Granada's status as a tributary state and its favorable geographic location, with the Sierra Nevada mountains as a natural barrier, helped to prolong Nasrid rule and allowed the Emirate to prosper as a regional entrepôt with the Maghreb and the rest of the Africa. In fact, Granada was a prosperous city during the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages when much of Europe stagnated. Granada also served as a refuge for Muslims fleeing during the Reconquista. Regardless of its comparative prosperity, intra-political strife was constant, skirmishes along the border occurred frequently and territory was gradually lost to Castile.
Granada was tightly integrated in Mediterranean trade networks and heavily financed by Genoese bankers aiming to gain control of the gold trade carried in through Saharan caravan routes. However, after Portugal opened direct trade routes to Africa by sea in the 15th century, Granada became less important as a regional commercial center. With the union of Castile and Aragon in 1469, these kingdoms set their sights on annexing Granada.
Fall of Granada.
The invasion of Granada would offer an opportunity for Ferdinand and Isabella to harness the restless Castilian nobility against a common enemy and instill subjects with a sense of loyalty to the crown. The Emirate's attack on the Castilian frontier town of Zahara in December 1481 provided the provocation for a Christian invasion. The Granada War began in 1482, with Christian forces capturing Alhama de Granada in February 1482. This marked the beginning of a grinding 10-year war. The Christian force was made up of troops provided by Castilian nobles, towns, and the "Santa Hermandad", as well as Swiss mercenaries. The Catholic Church also encouraged other Christian countries to offer their troops and their finances to the war effort. Meanwhile civil war erupted in Granada as a result of succession struggles in the Nasrid ruling house. Castile used this internal strife as an opportunity to push further into Granada. By 1491, the city of Granada itself lay under siege. On November 25, 1491, the Treaty of Granada was signed, setting out the conditions for surrender. On January 2, 1492, the last Muslim leader, Muhammad XII, known as "Boabdil" to the Spanish, gave up complete control of Granada, to Ferdinand and Isabella, "Los Reyes Católicos" ("The Catholic Monarchs").
Aftermath.
The Christian ousting of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula with the conquest of Granada did not extinguish the spirit of the "Reconquista". Isabella urged Christians to pursue a conquest of Africa. About 200,000 Muslims are thought to have emigrated to North Africa after the fall of Granada. Initially, under the conditions of surrender, the Muslims who remained were guaranteed their property, laws, customs, and religion. Following an uprising in 1500, these rights were withdrawn and Muslims in the area saw a steady decline in these liberties, until a second revolt in 1568-1571 led to their expulsion from the former Emirate.

of 1994: Over the past 10 years, Ghusel VDC, Lalitpur District has moved from primarily subsistence agriculture into the wider cash economy aided by the Small Farmers' Development Program (SFDP), which provides credit to farmers mainly for the purchase of buffalo for milk production, and by the National Dairy Corporation, which supports local dairy cooperatives. Analysis reveals that buffalo-keeping and milk sales are increasing the well-being of many households, while at the same time creating new inequalities in gender roles and responsibilities, greater inequities between Brahmin and Tamang residents in Ghusel, and placing pressures on the ecosystem for increased supplies of fodder and fuelwood. Evidence suggests that there is critical, need for attention to the social, and particularly gender-based, implications of maintaining livestock for milk sales and to the ecological underpinnings of this livelihood system.

Fleet and operations.
At the end of the war Japan was acutely short of large passenger ships. Only two had survived hostilities: NKK Line's "Hikawa Maru" and OSK Line's "Takasago Maru". Both had served as hospital ships and SCAJAP requisitioned them as transport ships.
On 7 December 1945 a conference was held at Tokyo as a result of which it was recommended that 100 Liberty ships, 100 LSTs and seven hospital ships be made available to SCAJAP for repatriation. The ships were to be converted in Japan to carry repatriates and were crewed by the Japanese.
Of the shipping requested, 106 Liberties and 100 LST's were received, but only 85 of the LST's were retained for repatriation, the other 15 LST's being used to support the economy of Korea. On arrival in Japan, under direction of SCAJAP, these ships were modified to carry passengers, provided with trained Japanese crews, and put in service at a rate of 25 a week. Six of the Liberties were converted into hospital ships of about 1,200 beds each. Since total available passenger capacity of these SCAJAP vessels was approximately 400,000 by the end of March 1946, all United States Seventh Fleet shipping was released from repatriation. Over 50 percent of the total Japanese repatriation fleet, with a capacity of 100,000 spaces supplemented US shipping.

An example of the use of a commissioned US ship, such as being temporarily assigned to SCAJAP, can be found here.

Other roles followed, including numerous budget westerns such as "The Glorious Trail" (1928), "Cheyenne" (1929), "Smilin' Guns" (1929) and "The Cisco Kid" (1931). Later film roles tended to get smaller and uncredited, such as his bit in The Marx Brothers's "Monkey Business" (1931), although one of his last parts, "third vampire" opposite Bela Lugosi in Tod Browning's "Mark of the Vampire" (1935), showcased his distinctive boney features to good effect. By this time, however, even small parts were eluding him and he took his own life in 1936, aged 41.

Bill Genaust

William Homer "Bill" Genaust (1907 – March 4, 1945) was a Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps, a war photographer who was wounded in the Battle of Saipan and killed in action in the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II. He is most known for capturing the Flag Raising on Iwo Jima on color motion picture film with his 16 millimeter camera.
World War II.
February 23, 1945: Sgt. Genaust and Pfc. Bob Campbell, a Marine still photographer, both assigned to E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division, and AP photographer Joe Rosenthal, were on the top of Mount Suribachi after a small American flag and flagstaff was raised and planted securely on the mountaintop about 10:30 a.m. by a Lieutenant with a group of Marines and a navy corpsman[http://www.ww2gyrene.org/role_corpsman.htm] from E Company, 3rd platoon. Around noon, the smaller American flag and flagstaff was replaced by a larger American flag on a heavier and longer flagstaff that was visible from any point on the island. Genaust with a motion picture camera stood near Rosenthal as the larger flag and flagstaff was hoisted by five Marines from E Company, 2nd platoon and the same corpsman from 3rd platoon, simultaneous with the lowering of the smaller flag and flagstaff.
Genaust's film briefly captures the servicemen getting in place to raise the larger flag, the raising and securing of the larger flag, and a group shot of members of the 2nd and 3rd platoons of E Company posing under the larger flag. Similar still photographs were taken by Rosenthal and Pfc. Campbell during this action.
Genaust's film also captures other Marines, one of whom gazes up at the larger flag. These Marines are not visible in Rosenthal's famous photograph.
March 4, 1945: Sgt. Genaust was killed by enemy small arms fire after he entered a darkened cave on Hill 362A located on the northwest corner of Iwo Jima. He had volunteered to use his flashlight or camera light in the cave and was killed supposedly with another unknown Marine. The cave mouth was covered over by bulldozing equipment, and despite renewed search efforts in 2007, his body has never been recovered.
Sergeant Genaust Award.
The Sergeant William Genaust Award is presented each year by the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation, one of a series of awards to both Marines and civilian community members recognizing their work in advancing and preserving Marine Corps history. It is given for a documentary and short subject (15 minutes or less) dealing creatively with U.S. Marine Corps heritage or Marine Corps life.[http://www.marineheritage.org/awards.asp]

Utricularia sect. Setiscapella

"Utricularia" sect. "Setiscapella" is a section in the genus "Utricularia" that contains small or medium-sized terrestrial or subaquatic species. Most plants in this section are endemic to Central and South America with the exceptions of "Utricularia stanfieldii", which is endemic to Africa, and "Utricularia subulata" which is almost pantropical. It was first described by John Hendley Barnhart in 1916 at the rank of genus. In 1973, Sadashi Komiya reduced the genus to a subgenus of the genus "Utricularia". In his 1986 monograph on the genus, Peter Taylor reorganized the genus and reduced this to the rank of section.

Jesse Koochin

Jesse Koochin was a 6-year-old boy from Utah who became the center of a legal battle between his parents, Steve and Gayle Koochin, and Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City. 
Jesse was diagnosed with an "inoperable and incurable" brain tumor in 2004. He had been undergoing care at Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City since September 15, 2004 when “his tumor pushed his brain stem down through the skull." Subsequently, two physicians independently determined that the child was "brain dead" and informed his parents that they would order life support removed within twenty-four hours. However, the parents rejected the hospital’s definition of death. Instead, relying on traditional notions of cardiopulmonary death, they obtained a restraining order to keep Jesse on a ventilator. Later, they removed the brain-dead child from the hospital. Jesse's heart ultimately stopped beating on November 19, 2004.
The landmark case was the first documented instance in the United States in which parents attempted to opt out of legally accepted standards of death.

Tiglieto Abbey

Tiglieto Abbey ("Badia di Tiglieto", also known as "Santa Maria alla Croce de Civitacula") is a religious complex in Tiglieto, Liguria, northern Italy. It was the first Cistercian abbey to be founded in Italy, and also the first outside France. 
The abbey is located on the left bank of the brook known as the Orba, 382 metres above sea level in the Province of Genoa, near the border of the Region of Piedmont.
History.
The abbey, founded in 1120 at the instigation of Peter of Tarentaise, was a daughter house of La Ferté Abbey. The first abbot was probably Opizzone. It may have gained the name Tiglieto () after being given the estate of that name by the Margrave Anselm of Ponsone in 1131.
Communities from Tiglieto settled Staffarda Abbey and Casanova Abbey as its daughter houses, both in the present Region of Piedmont.
In 1442, through Pope Eugenius IV, Tiglieto became an abbey "in commendam". In 1648 it was turned into a family estate of the last commendatory abbot, Cardinal Raggio, and dissolved. In 1747 the area was occupied by the Austrians, who shortly afterwards were driven out by the Genoese. 
In 2000 Tiglieto was reoccupied by the Cistercians.
Buildings and precinct.
The church is a primitive Romanesque brick basilica; the original side-chapels were removed in the 14th century to make way for a new east end. The nave was vaulted in the Baroque period, and a new choir at the west end was added at the same time, as was a Baroque campanile. The conventual buildings are to the south of the church. The early Gothic chapter house in the east range has survived, with a square chapter room with nine bays from the early 13th century and symmetrical triforium windows looking onto the central courtyard and the site of the cloister, no longer extant, with the dormitory with bricked-up windows in the upper storey, as have the sacristy, the "Fraternei" and to the south the refectory building, as well as the lay brothers' block in the west, now converted for residential purposes. The entire precinct was renovated for the new community that took over the premises in 2000.

James Jeffrey Roche

James Jeffrey Roche (31 May 1847, Mountmellick, Queen's County, Ireland – 3 April 1908, Berne, Switzerland) was an Irish-American poet, journalist and diplomat. Roche was taken to the United States as a young child, and grew up in Prince Edward Island. At the end of his life he was the American Consul in Switzerland.
Life and works.
Through his father, Edward Roche, an able mathematician and scholar, who occupied the office of Provincial Librarian in Prince Edward Island, he inherited the literary quality dominant in his temperament and his art. The family settled in Prince Edward Island in the same year as his birth. The boy was educated by his father, and later in St. Dunstan's College. Here, at the age of fifteen, foreshadowing his career, he turned journalist and proudly edited the college weekly "unto the urn and ashes" of its infant end. His youth had a fair share of spirited adventure, an encountering of odd characters and scenes, a sharp observance of events, and a close, rapid, honest mental life.
In 1866 he went to Boston, became a businessman and prospered there, but later reverted to literature, his early love and first unconscious choice. In print he was noted for an absurd, unique humor. Already married, in 1883 he joined the staff of the Boston "Pilot" as an assistant editor under John Boyle O'Reilly, and later became editor of the newspaper. At this time he wrote a "History of the Filibusters in Spanish America", a novel, and a drama. In 1886 he published "Songs and Satires".

Kent Opera

Kent Opera was a British opera company in the period 1969-1989. Based in Ashford, England the Company presented its productions in several centres mainly in the southern part of England. These included The Orchard Theatre, Dartford, the Assembly Halls, Tunbridge Wells, Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury, Kings Theatre, Southsea, Theatre Royal Norwich, the Derngate, Northampton. Operas were performed in English usually with new translations of the libretto. The orchestra was at first the Midland Sinfonia, though after two years the company employed its own orchestra.
History.
Kent Opera was England's first regional opera company, founded in 1969 by Norman Platt, in response to a perceived need for first-class opera in England outside the main centres, in productions that were composer-centred.
By 1974 there were usually three operas in the repertory at any time, typically a Baroque opera, a Mozart opera and a 19th or 20th century work. Wherever possible the company aimed to revive productions with the same team and singers and improve on the original production.
The company's performances were broadcast on radio and television. The company was the subject of a series of programmes made by TVS entitled "Staging an Opera". Channel 4 broadcast the production of "King Priam" in 1986 in celebration of Michael Tippett's 80th birthday.
Kent Opera did considerable work with children and in developing new audiences. This included commissioning children's operas from Alan Ridout, Adrian Cruft, Judith Weir, Christopher Brown and Ruth Byrchmore. Summer concerts from 1971 were presented in venues around the south east of England.
The company appeared at major British festivals: Edinburgh (1979), the City of London, Aldeburgh and Bath; as well as in Lisbon and Oporto (1974), Venice (1980), Schwetzingen (1976) and Singapore. It was the first British company to appear at the Vienna Festival in June 1986 at the Theater an der Wien. It presented "The Coronation of Poppea" at the Proms in 1975.
The founding Music Director of Kent Opera was Roger Norrington (1969-1984). He was succeeded by Iván Fischer (1984-1989). Chorus masters during its existence were Jonathan Hinden, Timothy Dean and Mark Tatlow.
The company received critical acclaim for the clarity and imagination of its productions.
Jonathan Miller directed his first opera at Kent Opera in 1974 ("Così fan tutte") and returned to direct six further operas. Other guest directors included Adrian Slack, Elijah Moshinsky, Nicholas Hytner (his first opera direction), Christopher Bruce, Adrian Noble, and Richard Jones (director).
Repertory.
The company performed a wide range of operas from the entire history of the genre:
In addition, the company gave world premières of the following operas: "The Pardoner's Tale" by Alan Ridout (1971), "The Black Spider" by Judith Weir (1985) and "A Night at the Chinese Opera" by Judith Weir (1987).
Closure.
The effective closure of Kent Opera in 1989 due to the withdrawal of all funding from the Arts Council was a controversial decision which generated much protest. In 1983 Kent Opera was the only opera company not to have its deficit written off. An Arts Council report in 1987 threatened to withdraw Kent Opera's grant from 1 April 1988 but this was successfully fought off, partly because the report contained much false information. In 1988 the company made successful tours to Singapore and Valencia in Spain, and with its 20th anniversary approaching, received plaudits in the press. When another proposal to cut the company was put forward in December 1989, Robert Ponsonby resigned from the music panel, performances at Covent Garden were cancelled and commissions from Michael Berkeley and Peter Maxwell Davies stopped.
Three further small-scale productions were mounted between 1994 and 1997.

Edward Sell (priest)

Canon Edward Sell (24 January 1839 – 15 February 1932) was an Anglican orientalist, writer and missionary in India. 
Biography.
Sell was born on 24 January 1839 in Wantage in Berkshire. He was educated at the Church Missionary College in Islington, London, completing his studies in 1862. In 1874 Sell was appointed as a fellow of Madras University and he received a Bachelor of Divinity from Lambeth in 1881. Sell received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Edinburgh University in 1907. He was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society and was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal in 1906. He was also appointed "Chairman of the Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani Studies".
After finishing his studies in 1862, Sell was ordained deacon and in 1867, priest. Sell served as the examining chaplain for the Bishop of Madras and in 1889 he was appointed canon at St. George's Cathedral, Madras. He is commemorated by a plaque in the Cathedral.
In 1865 Sell became the principal of the Harris High School for Muslims in Madras in which capacity he continued until 1881. It was also during this time that he was secretary of the Church Missionary Society for the dioceses of Madras and Travancore. He officially retired from the CMS in 1923, but continued to live in India, involving himself in scholarship and ministry. When he died in Bangalore on 15 February 1932, he was working on fiftieth book. 
Sell wrote extensively on Islam and biblical subjects, in particular, the Old Testament. His works include:

Battle of Motomiya-Ji

Background.
After Masamune's father was abducted and killed near Abukuma river, a general war proceeded between the Date clan and their traditional rivals the Hatakeyama clan. The Hatakeyama allied with the Soma, Satake, and Ashina. The allies marched with their 30,000 troops toward Motomiya-Ji. Masamune with only 7,000 troops prepared a defensive strategy, including forts that were on the way to Motomiya-Ji.
Battle.
Things did not look good for the Date clan. Three of his valuable forts were taken, and one of his chief retainers, Moniwa Yoshinao was killed in battle. The allies pressed on towards the Seto River. Date tried to force them back but failed. Date gathered his remaining forces for a last stand. But the next morning no doubt to the Date's amazement the main army picked up and marched away. These were Satake Yoshishige's men. In his absence the Satomi clan had attacked his lands in Hitachi Province. The allies thought they could not take down Motomiya with the remainder of men they had left, so they too retreated.

Klemm Kl 32

__NOTOC__
The Klemm Kl 32 was a touring aircraft developed in Germany in 1932 based on the Klemm Kl 31 as a competitor in the Challenge 1932 touring aircraft competition. Like its predecessor, it was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The Kl 32, however, had a smaller cabin (seating three), and a fuselage built from wood rather than metal. 
Eight Kl 32s were entered in the competition, seven by German teams and one by a Swiss team. These were powered by a variety of engines including the Bramo Sh 14, Argus As 8, de Havilland Gipsy, and Hirth HM 150. Notable German pilots included Robert Lusser (who designed the aircraft), Wolf Hirth, and Reinhold Poss. 
Hirth won the short take-off trial in his Kl 32, and Poss tied for second place in the overall competition with his. Five of the teams flying Kl 32s finished in the top ten in the "rally over Europe" part of the competition, and five of the top ten scores overall were achieved by teams flying Kl 32s.

Eugene M. Kulischer

Eugene M. Kulischer (1881–1956) was a Russian American sociologist, an authority on demography, migration, and manpower, and an expert on Russia. Kulischer coined the phrase “displaced persons” and was among the first to seek to document the number of persons lost in the Holocaust as well as the subsequent relocation of millions of Europeans after World War II.
Biography.
Born in Kiev in 1881 he died in Washington D.C, on April 2, 1956. Like his father, Michael Kulischer a noted Russian historian, he insisted that no migration occurs in isolation. Along with his brother Alexander, he worked on "Kriegs-und Wanderzüge, Weltgeschichte als Völkerbewegung" (War and Migration; World History as Peoples' Movements), (Berlin-Leipzig, Walter de Gruyter, 1932) and "Europe on the Move: War and Population Changes, 1917-1947." They were intended to show that migrations and wars go hand-in-hand.
In a way, Kulischer was himself an example of a displaced person. Following the Russian Revolution (1917), he fled Russia for Germany in 1920. Following the collapse of the Weimar Republic, he fled Germany for Denmark. In 1936 he went to Paris. In 1941 — at the age of 60 — Kulischer "crossed clandestinely the demarcation line between the occupied and the unoccupied parts of France" and went to the United States; his brother Alexander, "when crossing the demarcation line, was arrested by Pétain's gendarmes and died in a concentration camp.” 
Work.
In the United States Kulischer “served successively as consultant or staff member of the International Labor Office, the Office of Strategic Services, the Bureau of the Census, the Department of the Army, and the Library of Congress. His major works include "The Displacement of Population in Europe" (Montreal, 1943), and "Europe on the Move" (New York, 1948)”. At the heart of Kulischer's work is a simple axiom: individual short-distance movements in their combined action create great population shifts. An expansion of that concept is his oft quoted dictum:
“The migratory movement is at once perpetual, partial, and universal. It never ceases, it affects every people, but at a given moment it sets in motion only a small number of each population; hence the illusion of immobility. In fact, there is never a moment of immobility for any people, because no migration remains isolated”.
With that paragraph Kulischer created a bridge linking the migration of individuals and the demographic fact of great migrations. Kulischer and his brother, along with millions of others, tried to put Europe as far behind them as they could on the eve of World War II. All of them had their own reasons. Some left because of their ethnicity, others because of their religion. Some left because of their politics, and others because they feared the upheaval they were sure was looming on the horizon. For Kulischer and his brother the reason was close at hand. Not only were they Jewish, they forecast the outcome of World War II based on demographic trends. They reasoned that Russia and Germany were on a collision course and Germany would lose.
“Man's history,” Kulischer remarked, “is the story of his wanderings”. From the standpoint of the sociology of knowledge he added, “Most scholars are rooted in their environment. They differ in their ability to outgrow it”. By combining those two statements we have Kulischer and a great many of his peers who lived as exiles abroad and grew as they moved, for instance Austrian Social Scientists in Exile 1933-1945.
As Jackson and Howe recently observed in evaluating the impact of migrations:
"E. M. Kulischer once reminded his readers that in A.D. 900 Berlin had no Germans, Moscow had no Russians, Budapest had no Hungarians, Madrid was a Moorish settlement, and Constantinople had hardly any Turks. He added that the Normans had not yet settled in Great Britain and before the sixteenth century there were no Europeans living in North or South America, Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa."
Publications.
Eugene M. Kulischer published several books, a selection:

USS Pembina (AK-200)

USS "Pembina" (AK-200) – later known as USNS "Pembina" (T-AK-200) -- was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship that was constructed for the U.S. Navy during the closing period of World War II. After a brief period of service with the Navy in the Pacific theatre, she was transferred to the U.S. Army in Yokosuka, Japan. 
In 1951 she was returned to the Navy and served the remainder of her Navy career with the Military Sea Transportation Service. In 1968 she was again transferred to the Army as USAT "Resolute" and served with the Army until she was returned to the U.S. Maritime Administration and sold in 1996.
Built in Superior, Wisconsin.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Pembina" (AK–200) was laid down 23 June 1944 as MC Hull No. 2154 by the Globe SB Co., Superior, Wisconsin, launched 14 October 1944; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Mann; acquired by the Navy through the Maritime Commission 9 May 1945; and commissioned 25 May 1945 as "Pembina" (AK–200), Lt. James F. Moore, USNR, in command.
World War II-related service.
After shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, "Pembina" loaded cargo at Gulfport, Mississippi, for delivery to Subic Bay, Luzon in the Philippine Islands. She sailed 21 June, arriving 10 August, and proceeded with other cargoes to Okinawa; Jinsen, Korea; and Japanese ports. After off loading at Yokosuka, Japan 31 December, she was ordered to report to Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka to decommission.
Temporary service with the Japanese Navy.
"Pembina" decommissioned 26 January 1946 and was delivered to War Shipping Administration (WSA) representatives for turn over to the Japanese government under loan agreement (bare boat basis). She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 5 June.
"Pembina" operated under SCAJAP, with a Japanese crew and licensed American officers, until reinstated on the Naval Vessel Register 28 June 1950. She transferred from SCAJAP via the U.S. Army to the Navy Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) 1 April 1951 at Yokohama, Japan.
Assigned to the MSTS.
She was assigned to the Commander MSTS Pacific Area at San Francisco, California, 17 April 1956 following service in the Western Pacific Ocean, based in Japan.
Inactivation.
"Pembina" was placed in temporary custody of U.S. Maritime Administration (MarAd) 18 April 1957, and assigned to the Olympia, Washington, Reserve Fleet in ready status. She was given permanent assignment to MarAd 31 March 1958, berthed at Olympia, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day.
Transferred to the U.S. Army.
She remained at Olympia in the National Defense Reserve Fleet until transferred to the Army 29 May 1968. Renamed USAT "Resolute" 19 June 1968, the cargo ship served the U.S. Army until she was eventually returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission's James River Reserve Fleet on 25 January 1979. "Resolute" was sold by MarAd on 29 September 1981 under solicitation PD-X-1032 to Coast Line Associates, L.P. for operation as part of the purchase of 2 ships for operation for $651,000.
Commercial and Missionary Service.
"Resolute" was renamed Albert Norman and was used as a fishing ship until 1996, when the ship was donated to a US-based Missionary Group called Friendships. Now renamed, "Spirit of Grace", the former "Pembina" hauled supplies and delivered aid to needy people in various part of the world. On a mission trip to Israel in 2006, "Spirit of Grace" burned out a cylinder in her main engine, requiring an expensive rebuild. At the same time, Friendships was offered a newer vessel of similar size, which was accepted and has been renamed "Integrity". As a result, "Spirit of Grace" was returned to the original donor and subsequently sold to ESCO Marine in Brownsville Tx, where she was scrapped in December 2008.
Honors and awards.
Qualified "Pembina" personnel were eligible for the following:

Lyriel

Lyriel are a German heavy metal band who formed in autumn of 2003 in Gummersbach. Originally playing folk metal, they turned more towards symphonic metal on their latest studio album. Lyriel has recorded four studio albums and published a DVD of a live performance.
History.
The band's lineup remained unchanged from their formation until 2008. Lyriel played as opening act for bands such as Elis, Visions of Atlantis, Regicide, Xandria, Schandmaul, Corvus Corax, Saltatio Mortis, Oomph, Schelmish, Korpiklaani and Manfred Mann's Earth Band.
In 2005 they toured Germany, Austria and Belgium with Elis and Visions of Atlantis, in February 2006 Lyriel played on the “Romantic Darkness Tour“ together with Regicide and Xandria. Moreover they played on the Celtic Rock Festival at Greifenstein castle in Hesse. A video was released of the show. The first studio album "Prisonworld" was released on 17 January 2005. Especially notable is the song "Lind e-huil" which is sung in Sindarin, the fictional Elvish language created by J. R. R. Tolkien. The song "The Symmetry of Disfiguration" was inspired by Wendy and Richard Pini's "Elfquest" series.
Their second studio album "Autumntales" was published on 29 September 2006. It continues the band's style and among other songs contains a cover version of "Hijo de la Luna". The performance of the string instruments was lauded by the musical press, as well as Jessica Thierjung's singing. The track "My Favourite Dream", recorded together with Sabine Dünser of Elis, was also acclaimed as one of the harder songs on the album.
In September 2008 drummer Daniel de Beer left the band and was replaced by Marcus Fidorra. Since then the lineup has changed several times.
"The First Chapters", a remastered compilation album containing the first two studio albums was published in 2009. A new album "Paranoid Circus" followed on 29 January 2010. German voice actor Simon Jäger, known for dubbing actors like Heath Ledger and Matt Damon, appears as a guest artist on the album, reading an introduction and an excerpt from Hermann Hesse's short story "The Wolf" in the middle of the album. German and Austrian reviews agreed that while offering a high musical standard this album lacks the general speed of the previous releases. The album was re-released on AFM Records in April 2011 with a new cover artwork and 2 bonus tracks.
Lyriel signed with AFM Records in 2011. A fourth album named "Leverage" was released in February 2012. Among a mix of soft folk rock as well as symphonic metal, it features a duet with Schandmaul vocalist Thomas Lindner. "Leverage" received positive reviews in Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom. It was however noted that the "album does lose some steam near its conclusion" and that the band should have dared to evolve towards harder metal songs. "Leverage" contains two songs "The Road Not Taken" and "Parting" that are based on lyrics by Robert Frost and Charlotte Brontë respectively On the extended edition there is a version of "Everything's Coming Up Roses" by Black.
Style and influences.
The septet designate their music "Dark Romantic Celtic Rock". Lyriel's repertoire ranges from medievally inspired ballads to hard rock pieces with elements of classical and folk music. Early recordings were frequently compared to Blackmore's Night, but the band has evolved towards symphonic metal with gothic influences.

Untamed &amp; Uncut

Untamed & Uncut (also written as Untamed and Uncut and also Animal Real TV) is an American documentary television series that premiered on June 10, 2008 on Animal Planet. The program depicts unexpected and surprising animal encounters that are caught directly on tape at the scene. Each different video usually has something to do with an animal attack on a human, either intentionally or unintentionally, animals fighting each other, animals causing havoc within a community, or animal rescues in which the animal is in grave danger (e.g., is deeply stuck in mud or ice, or is stuck on a cliff) or has been severely wounded. Most of the time, no one is killed, although a few deaths and many minor and severe injuries have occurred. Due to the disturbing content, "Untamed & Uncut" holds a TV-14 rating.
A sneak peek originally appeared on June 10, 2008 - the show officially debuted on October 12, 2008 with the special "Vacation Nightmares".

Taifa of Zaragoza

The taifa of Zaragoza was an independent Muslim state in Moorish Al-Andalus, present day eastern Spain, which was established in 1018 as one of the taifa kingdoms, with its capital in Islamic Saraqusta (Zaragoza) city. Zaragoza's taifa emerged in the 11th century following the destruction of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the Moorish Iberian Peninsula. 
During the first three decades of this period (1018–1038) the city was ruled by the Banu Tujibi. They were replaced by the Banu Hud, who had to deal with a complicated alliance with El Cid of Valencia and his Castilian Masters against the Almoravids who managed to bring the Taifas Emirates under their control. After the death of El Cid, his kingdom was conquered by the Almoravids, and by 1100 they had crossed the Ebro into Barbastro, which brought into direct contact with Aragon. 
The Banu Hud stubbornly resisted the Almoravid dynasty and ruled until they were eventually defeated by the Almoravids in May 1110. The last sultan of the Banu Hud, Abd-al-Malik, and "Imad ad-Dawla" of Saraqusta, was forced to abandon the capital. Abd-al-Malik allied himself with the Christian Aragonese under Alfonso I of Aragon and from the time the Muslims of Saraqusta became military regulars within the Aragonese forces. They were known as Almogavars.

Clay (musical)

Clay is a 2008 Hip-hop musical loosely based on Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2" and Falstaff written and performed by Matt Sax. The first performance was at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
Synopsis.
The show opens with Sir John presenting his protégé, Clay, for his first major concert. Clay shows up an hour late, blood covering his face. In an attempt to stall for time, Sir John tells the audience the story of Clay's life.
Clay's real name is Clifford Keys. His father is an emotionally-absent businessman, and his mother is a depressed chain-smoker. When he is seven years old, Clifford's parents decide to divorce, and his father manipulates the boy into asking to stay with his father. After missing three of Clifford's birthdays in a row, Clifford's mother commits suicide. His father quickly remarries.
Years pass, and Clifford is sixteen years old. To escape his dysfunctional family, he begins going to open-mic nights at a small bookstore. The MC is Sir John, a talented rapper whose face was deformed in a car accident and has no chance of getting signed to a record label. Clifford begins weekly hip-hop lessons with Sir John, and he begins his transformation from awkward novice to confident storyteller. When Sir John asks Clifford to rap about the girl he loves, Clifford reveals that he is in love with his stepmother, and they have slept together. Sir John begs Clifford to come live with him, but Clifford refuses.
Clifford's father returns one night to find his wife and son in bed together. He throws Clifford out of the house, and Clifford goes to live with Sir John. Three years pass, and under Sir John's wing, Clifford has become the successful rapper Clay. His song about his family life is a radio hit. On the night of his on-stage debut, Clifford's father tracks him down and reprimands him for embarrassing his family, telling him, "Your mother is rolling in her grave." In the ensuing fight, Clifford nearly kills his father, but he decides to let him go.
After Clifford recounts the fight, Sir John tell him that he is proud of Clifford for letting his father go. They get him cleaned up in time for him to come out on stage and give a triumphant debut performance.
Lincoln Center Production at The Duke on 42nd St..
Developed in collaboration with and directed by Eric Rosen
History.
During a short run at Northwestern University in 2004, Eric Rosen of About Face Theatre saw Clay, later sending it to an About Face production in Chicago under his direction, and later the Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles. A year later, Clay was brought to Rosen's new theatre, Kansas City Repertory Theatre, before going to the Lincoln Center in New York.

Essential factors model

The Essential Factors model is an incident investigation model based on determining the essential and contributory factors that lead to an incident. An incident is viewed in terms of an interaction of essential and contributing factors that results in damage to people, property or production. An essential factor is one which when removed from, or added to, an incident sequence will interrupt that sequence. A contributing factor is one which increases the likelihood that the sequence of factors will continue but is not essential to the damage.
Every incident has essential factors associated with people, equipment and environment giving the 100% paradigm:
100% / 100% / 100% paradigm –
It is the purpose of the Essential Factors model to attempt to use value-neutral language to give maximum “meaning” and minimum “affect”. This will not always be the case but it is suggested that the use of the word “cause” and “human error” by an accident investigator during data collection and interview phases, will have a potentially greater negative response than the use of alternative words.
All essential factors differ in controllability. Each essential factor, once identified is able to be reviewed for potential points of control. That is potential ways in which to reduce the risk of that incident re-occurring.

<doc id="19253941" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19253941" title="Sufyani">
Sufyani

The Sufyani (Arabic: ), is an apocryphal character of Islamic eschatology. The Sufyani will emerge before the Mahdi from the depths of Damascus.
The term "Sufyani" is a term referring to his descent from the progeny of Abu Sufyan. He will be one of many Muslim tyrants that the Mahdi will have to face in the Middle East. The Sufyani is not the Dajjal. The Ahadith regarding the Sufyani specify that he is a tyrant who will spread corruption and mischief on the earth before the Mahdi. He will be such a tyrant that he will kill the children and rip out the bellies of women. The Sufyani will murder those from the household of the Prophet and will rule over Syria. When he hears about the Mahdi, he will send an army to seize and kill him. However the earth will swallow this army before it even reaches the Mahdi.
Abu Hurayrah has narrated that the Prophet said:
A man will emerge from the depths of Damascus. He will be called Sufyani. Most of those who follow him will be from the tribe of Kalb. He will kill by ripping the stomachs of women and even kill the children. A man from my family will appear in the Haram, the news of his advent will reach the Sufyani and he will send to him one of his armies. He (referring to the Mahdi) will defeat them. They will then travel with whoever remains until they come to a desert and they will be swallowed. None will be saved except the one who had informed the others about them. (Mustadrak Al-Hakim)
The Sufyani will be followed, for the most part, by the tribe of Banu Kalb, and will have fought with anyone daring to oppose him. Injustice will rule the day and his disregard for life will reach the point where defenseless women will be ripped open and innocent children slain unmercifully. The tribe of Qays will rise up against him, however, they will not succeed, and he will slaughter all of them.
The Sufyani's army will go to Kufa; a city in Iraq, and from there he will launch an attack against the people of Khurasan. At the Gate of Istakhr, Shuayb bin Salih and the Hashimite under the black banners, will join forces and engage the army of the Sufyani. The battle will be extremely fierce with a tremendous loss of life and the army of the Sufyani will suffer a temporary defeat. It is at this time that a yearning for the Mahdi's appearance is on the lips of everyone.
The army of the Sufyani will march from the direction of Iraq to seize the Mahdi, however, when they reach the desert near Dhi Hulayfah the ground will swallow them up. However, two will escape to convey the news but even when he learns of the occurrence he will not be deterred. There will be some people from the Quraysh who manage to escape from him to Constantinople, which will be at that time under the control of the Non-Muslims. When the Sufyani asks for their return they will be returned whereupon not only the escapees' throats will be slit but those like them.
Khalid bin Ma'dan said:
The Sufyani will emerge with three staffs in his hand. Anyone whom he strikes with them will die. (Nu'aym bin Hammad)
The Sufyani is a man whose trial involves his person, his power, his speed and his fighting. One of his wonders consists of his staffs, which kill anyone he strikes with them. The hadith about the Sufyani confirms that he is a tyrant who will spread corruption and crime in the Earth immediately before the appearance of the Mahdi.
Details of the Sufyani.
Name and Title.
According to Imam Qurtubi, his name will be 'Urwa bin Muhammad and his "talha" is 'Abu Utbah' and is given the title "Sufyani" due to his descent from Abu Sufyan.
Physical characteristics.
He will be a man with a large head, a pockmarked face, and white spots in his eyes.
Family Lineage.
The Sufyani will be from the progeny of Yazid bin Mu'awiya. His mother will be from the tribe of Kalb, but he is from the progeny of Khalid bin Yazid bin Abu Sufyan.
Character.
Outwardly he will appear to be pious, but in reality he will be an apostate.
Prior to his emergence.
Before the rise of the Sufyani, there will be a sedition in the Maghreb, the sedition will spread in every direction that no party or group could protect itself from it.
Disorder, strife, and fear will emerge in the Magrib (west)... Strife will proliferate. (Ash-Sharani, Mukhtasar Tazkirah al-Qurtubi, p. 440)
Later the sedition which started in the west will arrive to Al-Sham, Syria, thus two banners will fight for control over the Syrian region; they will fight until their armies are exhausted. Following these events the Sufyani will start an uprising in the dry valley of Transjordan and moves to seize Damascus, he will gain much support and he will advance to capture the rest of Syria, defeating the two other competing forces. Once he captures the 5 districts of Al-Sham, he will send armies to Iraq..
Details of his emergence and rule.
In revolt, a Sufyani (possibly by the name of 'Urwah ), who descends from Abu Sufyan, and whose mother is from the tribe of Kalb, will come (possibly from Egypt) with 360 riders until he reaches Damascus. Then he will emerge - overrunning and seizing control of Syria. He will have three staffs in his hand, and anyone whom he strikes with them will die. After a month the tribe of Kalb will also follow him. The Sufyani will then send an army to Iraq, killing 100,000 in Al-Zawra', and also will receive the support of non-Muslims. The Sufyani and his forces will go to Kufa and pillage it, killing the descendants of the Prophet and to the point where he kills children and murders women. In retaliation the tribe of Qays will rise up against him, but they will be defeated, and he will slaughter them in Kurkisa. One of them will escape to the Muslims, and then the forces of the Sufyani will come, demanding the Muslims be handed over. Then an army carrying black banners will come, and at their front is a youth from the tribe of Tamim named Shu'ayb bin Salih, along with a Hashemite. They will engage the forces of the Sufyani at the Gate of Istakhr (in southern Iran) and will defeat them, however, the riders will escape. The Muslim, after suffering from the battle, will demand the Mahdi out of necessity. Then an army of the Sufyani will go to Medina, and pillage it for three days, and those who escape will flee to Mecca. Several men from the Quraysh will escape to Istanbul and the Sufyani will send to the leader of the Romans who returns them to the Sufyani and he will slit their throats together with their followers.
When the story of Divine Help being granted to the Mahdi spreads throughout the Muslim world, the Abdals of Syria will come to pledge allegiance to the Mahdi and join his ranks. Similarly, other Muslim armies from Medina and elsewhere will also come to Mecca and offer their support and allegiance to the Mahdi. The Imam will leave Mecca for Medina, where he will offer salaam at the Rowzha Mubarak (The Grave of Muhammad). Soon after, the forces of the Mahdi will move onward from Medina, and engage the forces of the Sufyani at Syria. The Sufyani’s forces will be defeated in Syria, and this will be known as the "Battle of Kalb". The Muslim fighters under the Mahdi will capture the Sufyani and execute him under a tree and Syria would thus be liberated from the tyrannical rule of the Sufyani.

As a composer, Davies's music is fundamentally optimistic in disposition which critics have often described as "happy", "cheerful", and "uplifting". Rhythmically vigorous, well orchestrated, and readily accessible, his music strives for simplicity and elegance while still using a wide range of historical and contemporary musical forms and techniques such as twelve-tone, aleatoric, jazz, and popular music elements. 
A pragmatist, Davies has criticized the trend within classical composition to reject popular music forms. He believes it is socially irresponsible to pursue the clever or different merely for the sake of academic approval. Davies says that "artists must have utility in the community, and their music must embody melodies that are memorable, something that is cherishable." 
Davies first came to public attention for his "Mennonite Piano Concerto" which was
commissioned by the B.B. Fast Foundation. The concerto premiered on 27 October 1975 by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Bill Baerg with pianist Irmgard Baerg. The work was received with high praise and has since been recorded several times, including a 1983 recording with Baerg and the London Symphony Orchestra.
He has since composed a variety of compositions in several genres including symphonic works, chamber music, film and television scores, operas, musical theater, and jazz music among others. He has written over 600 songs for the CTV children's series "Let's Go" and "Rockets". His other compositions for stage, television, and film include, "The Last Winter" (1990), "The Nutcracker Prince" (1991), "Toothy Fairy, Where Are You?", "The Nature of Things" (2002), "For the Moment" (1994), the music for the 1999 Pan American Games, and the musical "The Importance of Being Ernest" which was performed for the Stratford Festival in 2005.
He has written music for several commissions including "Pulsations" (1978) for the CBC; "Anerca" (1969) for the Contemporary Dancers; "Animal Capers" (1983) for the Famous People Players; "The Magic Trumpet" (1969) and "Reginald the Robot" (1971) for the Manitoba Theatre Centre; "Fun For Four" (1980) for the Orford String Quartet; "The Big Top" (1985) for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet; numerous works for the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra including "Celebrations" (1969), "From Harmony"(1968), "A Short Symphony" (1974), and the "Jazz Piano Concerto" (2001); "Jazz Concerto for Organ and Orchestra" (2000) for Wayne Marshall; and "Yukon Scenes" (1985/1997) for the Yukon Arts Council among others. "The Musical Circus" was commissioned by Soundstage Canada in 1981, which performed the work in Eastern Europe.
Perhaps his most highly regarded work is his oratorio "Revelation" which uses texts from the Bible's Book of Revelation. It premiered in February 1996 by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and the Mennonite Oratorio Choir under Bramwell Tovey and has subsequently been performed in Vancouver, Ottawa, and Hamilton. This was followed in 2007 by the opera "Transit of Venus", commissioned by Manitoba Opera.
In 2008, Davies completed a tuba concerto entitled "Concerto for Tubameister" which received its piano premier in Vancouver, BC on 26 September 2008 performed by J.c. Sherman, for whom the work was composed. The work received its orchestra premiere with the Winnipeg Symphony, Chris Lee, soloist, in January, 2009.
In 2002, Davies won a Gemini Award for "Honour Before Glory".

Carl Ginet

Carl Ginet (born 1932) is an American philosopher and Professor Emeritus at Cornell University. His work is primarily in action theory, moral responsibility, free will, and epistemology.
Ginet received his BA from Occidental College in 1954, and his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1960 with a dissertation entitled "Reasons, Causes, and Free Will". He joined the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell in 1971 and retired in 1999. Before Cornell, Ginet was a faculty member of various universities, including Ohio State University, University of Michigan, and University of Rochester.
Notes.
From http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/ginet/
"Carl Ginet is an incompatibilist. He may have helped originate the position called incompatibilism, in his 1966 article. 
Ginet argues that reasons can be considered as causal explanations for actions, but that reasons themselves are "non-causal," allowing us to escape from causal determinism. What he claims is that (contra Donald Davidson) the truth of a reasons explanation of an action does not require that the explaining reason-states (beliefs, desires, etc.) caused the action; but he allows that their causing the action is compatible with the reasons explanation. 
He has written two important articles on the subject - "Might We Have No Choice?" in Freedom and Determinism, ed. K. Lehrer (1966) and "Can the Will be Caused?" in Determinism, Free Will, and Moral Responsibility, G. Dworkin, 1970. 
In "Might We Have No Choice?," Ginet stated the Determinism Objection to Free Will in a form similar to Peter van Inwagen's "Consequence Argument" of twenty years later. 
I shall be concerned with one possible specification of the old unclear question of whether free will is incompatible with determinism. I want to see if it is possible to construct an hypothesis about the antecedents of human behavior that...is compatible with all previous observations and well-established hypotheses... and implies that no human being ever has a choice as to whether or not he shall behave as he actually does (ever really chooses the way that he does behave). (p. 87) 
Every temporal segment of every human being's behavior 'B' has a...series of antecedent sets of circumstances having the descriptions 'A1', 'A2' .. . . ., 'An', such that 
1.'A1' does not entail 'B';
2.A1 contingently necessitates A2, A2 contingently necessitates A3, . . ., An-1 contingently necessitates An; and
3.the human being in question clearly had no choice as to whether or not the antecedent instance of A1 would occur. (p. 88)
In this seminal article, Ginet also described hypothetical mind-controllers that anticipate Harry Frankfurt's controllers a couple of years later. Ginet says that his controller directly causes both the path the car takes and the motivational and volitional events in the agent's brain in such a way as to make them coincide and give the agent the illusion that his voluntary bodily actions are steering the car. The corresponding Frankfurt controller would directly cause only the motivational and volitional processes and through them cause the bodily actions and the steering of the car by the agent. 
Suppose that the path that the car takes is controlled by some person other than the rider, who also controls (through, say, instruments attached to the rider's brain) what delusions or illusions of steering the rider will have, and suppose that this controller sees to it that the path he makes the rider think he is choosing is always the same as the path he (the controller) makes the car take. In this case, even though it is true that, if the rider had had the impression of choosing a different path the car would have taken a correspondingly different path, it is still the case that the rider's choice-impression does not determine what path the car takes, that the rider has no choice of any sort as to what path it will take, and, hence, that he does not effectively choose its path. (p. 103)"

Klemm Kl 105

__NOTOC__
The Klemm Kl 105 was a two-seat sport aircraft developed in Germany in 1938. It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed, tailskid undercarriage, and side-by-side seating for two within an enclosed cockpit. Construction throughout was of wood, with the fuselage built using a new semi-monocoque technique which Klemm patented. Plans to produce the design in series were abandoned with the outbreak of the Second World War.
Development.
In January 1937 Major Werner Junck, chief of the LC II, the technical wing of the "Reichsluftfahrtministerium" responsible for the development of new aircraft, informed various minor aircraft manufacturers such as Bücker, Fieseler, Gothaer Waggonfabrik, Flugzeugwerke Halle and Klemm that they would not get any contracts for the development of military aircraft. He therefore advised them to concentrate in the development of a "Volksflugzeug" or a small twin-engined plane. As a result Klemm developed the Kl 105, while the other companies produced the Fi 253, the Si 202, the Bü 180 and the Go 150.

Western Link

Västlänken () is a planned railway tunnel under central Gothenburg. The purpose of the project is to increase capacity and reduce travel times on the Gothenburg network by changing the Gothenburg Central Station from a terminus to an underground transit station. Two new underground transit stations, Haga and Korsvägen, will also be built.
Of the 920,000 people (2009 figure) who live in Greater Gothenburg 410,000 people live outside the Gothenburg urban area. Approximately 250,000 people in the region commute to or from Gothenburg Municipality. The majority of these people use cars for transportation and the roads in the region are overloaded. Better rail communications to different parts of Gothenburg and better transitions to trams would improve the situation. There is a political wish to attract more public transport users. Big money has been and is being invested for rail infrastructure in the Stockholm region and the Malmö region, more than 20 bn SEK each during 1990-2010, but much less in the Gothenburg region. 
The largest improvement according to the prosed plan would be for people who commute from places along the railways to Kungsbacka/Borås and who work or study near station Haga, where a large part of the Gothenburg University is located. 15 minutes could be saved per journey. Also in other relations time would be saved, for example around 5 minutes from Alingsås to Sahlgrenska or Chalmers.
History.
Planning process.
Already in the 1950s there were plans for a tunnel under the inner city for railbound vehicles, then for trams. The plans were given up because of cost. The city has to finance tramways, while the government finances railways. 
The planning process has elapsed during a long period of time, being included in preliminary city plans in the mid 90s under the project name "Centrumtunneln". A feasibility study was conducted in 2001–2002 by Banverket in cooperation with Västra Götalandsregionen, Västtrafik, Göteborgsregionen, and city of Göteborg. Similar rail tunnels are already under construction in Malmö and in Stockholm.
Västlänken is not part of the Trafikverket Future plan (swe: Framtidsplan) 2004–2015, nor the alternative plan. Construction could start earlier since the Västra Götaland Regional Council is willing to invest money in the project.
Routes.
Banverket investigated three routes for Västlänken, including new stations along the routes in the city centre. The route alternatives were named after the proposed new stations; Haga–Korsvägen, Haga–Chalmers, and Korsvägen. In addition to these underground alternatives, an expansion of the current rail network to the south, with a larger termius station was investigated, named Förstärkningsalternativet ().
Decision.
On December 19, 2007, Banverket chose the Haga-Korsvägen alternative as it best fulfilled the goals for the expansion. A majority of other governmental bodies to which the proposed routes were referred for consideration also agreed on that opinion.
Construction.
The construction cost for the project is estimated to SEK 14,5 billion, by price index of January 1, 2007. By 2012 the estimated cost had increased to 20 billion. The cost of the project is going to be financed partly by road taxes taken from motorists entering central Gothenburg and passing through the city on the major throughfares.

2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship

UEFA U-21 Championship 2011 was the 18th staging of UEFA's European Under-21 Football Championship. The final tournament was hosted by Denmark between 11 and 25 June 2011.
The Danish bid was chosen by UEFA's Executive Committee on 10 December 2008 in Nyon, Switzerland. This bid defeated the other bid from Israel.
Qualification for the final tournament took place between March 2009 and October 2010.
Spain won their third title after defeating Switzerland 2–0 in the final.
Host selection.
The organisation of the event was initially contested by only two bids: Denmark and Israel. The bids were submitted on 15 June 2008.
The bids were inspected between June and September 2008, and a report was given to the National Team Competition Committee in October. The committee discussed the bids on 27 November 2008 and issued a recommendation to the UEFA Executive Committee, who decided on 10 December 2008 that Denmark would host the finals.
Qualification.
The draw for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifying round took place in Århus on 4 February 2009. The qualifying draw determined the makeup of ten groups. Ten groups were formed in the qualifying draw including two sections of six sides and eight of five, as teams chase 7 finals places alongside host Denmark. The seeding pots are formed on the basis of former performance in the tournament. All groups contained one nation from the first five pots and two sections also included a team from Pot 6. The six European federations that have qualified for the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup (Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain and England) were each drawn in one of the six groups of five teams.
2012 Summer Olympics and Great Britain team.
The tournament was used as the European qualifying tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London with the top teams qualifying for London 2012. The four British federations entered the qualification process as single entities, but are not eligible to qualify for the Olympics. If one or more British teams had qualified for the Championship, and to pass the first round, play-off games would be played (like in 2007 when Italy and Portugal faced for the last place in the Olympics). As Great Britain is the host nation for the 2012 Olympics, it is entitled to an automatic place in the competition. This caused controversy as in the Olympics, Great Britain competes as a single unified country, as opposed to the four individual nations in football. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all logged public objections to the idea of a GB team at the Olympics, fearing that it would jeopardise their independent status in UEFA and FIFA. A compromise was reached in 2009 whereby England would field a team for the tournament, while the other three would not participate, but not object to England's involvement.
List of qualified teams.
The following 8 teams qualified for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship
Venues.
The tournament venues were all located in Jutland, at already existing stadiums in Aarhus, Aalborg, Herning and Viborg.
On 20 September 2010 it was announced that Aarhus Stadion would host the final. Further Aalborg Stadion was confirmed as the venue for the opening match and the eventual Olympic qualifying play-off. The semifinals were played at Herning Stadium and Viborg Stadion. It was also published that Denmark would play all of its matches in Aalborg and Aarhus.
Format.
The final tournament consisted of two groups of four, with the top two from each progressing to the semifinals where it becomes a knockout competition. In the finals held a year before a summer Olympic Games the championship also serves as qualification for the Olympic Football Tournament.
Players were eligible for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship if they were born on or later than 1 January 1988.
Seeding.
The draw for the final tournament took place on 9 November 2010 at "Aalborg Congress & Culture Centre" in Aalborg.
Similar to former tournaments, the games in each group are to be held at just two stadia. For the draw, the finalists were divided into three seeding pots, based on average points per game in the qualifying phase, with each group having one team from pot 1 and 2, and two teams from pot 3. Denmark, as hosts, were seeded first automatically.
Squads.
Squads for the 2011 Euro U-21 Championship consisted of 23 players, as in the previous tournament in 2009. Only players born on or after the 1st of January, 1988 were eligible to play.
Referees.
In April 2011 UEFA published a list of referees, assistant referees and fourth officials to officiate at the tournament. All of the referees are either Premier Category 1-referees or Category 2-referees, respectively the second highest and third highest tier of international referees. All referees are appointed because they are deemed to be future elite referees, thus they are all between 31 and 38 years old and therefore adhere to the U21 philosophy of being the tournament of the stars of tomorrow.
Referees
Fourth officials
Tiebreakers.
As in Under-21 Euro 2009: If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings.
Group stage.
The draw took place on 9 November 2010 in Aalborg, Denmark.
The first round saw the eight teams divided into two groups of four teams. Each group was a round-robin, where each teams plays one game against every other team in their group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and no points for a defeat. The teams finishing first and second in each group qualified for the semifinals.
Group A.
In group A tie-breakers were needed to break down the three point tie with Belarus, Denmark and Iceland. Belarus advanced due to a better goal difference in the matches between those three.
All times are UTC+2.
Group B.
All times are UTC+2.
Team of the Tournament.
The UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament. The group of nine analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Spain, with seven, have most players in team.

The Government of National Unity, also known as the "grand coalition cabinet," was a designation for the coalition government in Kenya from April 2008 to April 2013. It was formed through negotiations between the Orange Democratic Movement's leader and presidential candidate Raila Odinga and Party of National Unity's leader and incumbent presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis which had followed the controversial 2007 presidential election. 
Kibaki continued serving as the president while Odinga accepted a non-executive prime ministerial post. The cabinet constituted a record 40 ministers and 52 deputy ministers from different political parties. The deal for the creation of the cabinet was finalized on 13 April 2008, followed by the appointment of Odinga as prime minister on 14 April and the swearing-in of all members of the cabinet on 17 April.

<doc id="19254240" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19254240" title="Stanford Super Series">
Stanford Super Series

The Stanford Super Series were a series of Twenty20 cricket matches, sponsored by Allen Stanford. The main game of the Series matched the English national cricket team against an all-star team from the Caribbean, called the Stanford Superstars.
The prize money awarded in the tournament was winner-take-all; the players for the winning team in the yearly game took home $20 million prize money, and the losing players did not earn anything. The domestic West Indies and England Twenty20 champions competed for the "Champions Cup", as well as playing in a series of other exhibition matches with the Superstars and England. The tournament collapsed following the arrest (and subsequent conviction) of Allen Stanford for fraud and the ending of relationships between Stanford and the England and Wales Cricket Board.
History.
Allen Stanford proposed emphasizing Twenty20 cricket as a way to promote cricket in the West Indies. He created the Stanford 20/20, a yearly tournament featuring teams from the island nations that made up the West Indies. From the first edition of his tournament in 2006 he aimed to have the best players from his tournament play as a team against an international team. Initially South Africa had been planned to play against the Stanford team for a prize of US$5 million, but that effort fell through after scheduling conflicts with the WICB.
In 2008, Stanford looked to expand the tournament, and decided once again to feature a high stakes game featuring the best players in the West Indies versus an international team. Stanford initially wished to invite Sri Lanka, India, Australia and South Africa to come and play a single elimination tournament in Antigua, with the winner facing his all-star team. However due to contractual issues with the ICC and ESPN-Star and scheduling constraints that tournament was infeasible. Instead, Stanford invited the winners of the World Twenty20, India, to play for a prize of US$5 million (later US$10 million) and planned to ask Australia to come as a back-up should India decline or be unavailable. India, who were in the process of launching the highly successful first year of their domestic Twenty20 league, the Indian Premier League, declined as they did not want to be involved in a privately funded programme.
When that deal fell through, Stanford increased the prize money to US$20 million and aimed to get either England or Australia involved. After meeting with the ECB from April through June, Stanford finally signed a five-year deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board to host a series of US$20 million, winner-take-all matches, worth $100 million in total. In addition, the deal included an annual Twenty20 quadrangular involving England (as hosts), West Indies and two invitational teams with a prize of US$9.5 million.
Prize money.
The final $20 million prize was split as follows: each of the 11 players on the winning team who played in the championship game would take home $1 million. Another $1 million would be split amongst the players who were selected for the winning team, but did not play in the championship game; $1 million would go to the management team and the remaining $7 million would be split between the English Cricket Board and the West Indies Cricket Board.
Competitors.
The Stanford Superstars and an England XI were scheduled to compete in the first five tournaments. Alongside them were the champions of the Stanford 20/20 in the West Indies and the champions of the Twenty20 Cup in England. These were Trinidad and Tobago and Middlesex Crusaders. The two domestic champions competed for the Champions Cup whilst Stanford Superstars and England contested the Final, labelled the "20/20 For 20" match.
Reception.
The matches were well attended, but the press (especially the British contingent) was mainly sceptical. "Of all the short-form matches currently being organised," wrote Stephen Brenkley on 26 October, "the conclusion is easily reached that Stanford Superstars v England is the most offensive. It has no context as a proper sporting competition, it is neither country versus country, club versus club or invitation XI versus invitation XI. It is a rococo hybrid. It has money but nothing else going for it."
Dissolution.
Following the first year of the series, the future of the competition was put in doubt after Stanford disbanded his team of 12 'Stanford Legends' who had been acting as ambassadors for the tournament. In the wake of fraud charges made against Stanford, the ECB terminated all contracts with Stanford in February 2009, meaning that the England cricket team took no further part in Stanford organised matches. Stanford was later convicted of 13 of 14 charges laid against him by U.S. authorities and was sentenced to 110 years in prison.

Beta Doradus (Beta Dor, β Doradus, β Dor) is the second brightest star in the southern constellation of Dorado. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.63, making it visible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere. Based upon parallax measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope, it is located at a distance of from Earth.
Beta Doradus is a Cepheid variable that regularly changes magnitude from a low of 4.05 to a high of 3.45 over a period of 9.842 days. The light curve of this magnitude change follows a regular saw-tooth pattern. During each radial pulsation cycle, the radius of the star varies by ±3.9 times the Sun's radius around a mean of 67.8. Its spectral type and luminosity class are likewise variable, from F-type to G-type and from a supergiant to a bright giant.
Far ultraviolet emissions have been detected from this star with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, while X-ray emissions were detected with the XMM-Newton space telescope. The X-ray luminosity is about 1 × 1029 ergs/sec and the emission varies with the pulsation period, suggesting a connection with the pulsation process. The peak X-ray emissions are in the 0.6–0.8 keV energy range, which occurs for plasmas with temperatures of 7–10 million K.

Supercharge (band)

Supercharge were a 1970s English rock band from Liverpool, founded by singer/saxophonist Albie Donnelly and drummer Dave Irving. They had a number three hit single in Australia with "You've Gotta Get Up and Dance" in 1977.
History.
Beginnings and Australian success.
Founded in early 1974, by Liverpool tenor-saxophonist, Albie Donnelly (born Albert Edward Donnelly, 12 August 1947, Huyton, Liverpool), and drummer Dave Irving (born David Geddes Irving, 18 November 1946, Crosby, Liverpool) after they had both left the 'In Crowd' cabaret band, Supercharge soon built up quite a cult following in Liverpool at 'The Sportsman', a popular city-centre pub on Sunday and later Monday nights and also at the 'Dove and Olive' at Speke.
Original members included Donnelly (bandleader, vocalist, and tenor saxophonist), Ozzie Yue (guitar/vocals) (born Austin J Yue, 12 August 1947, Liverpool), Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell (tenor sax, guitar, harmonica, and vocals), Alan Peters (trumpet), Bob Robertson (baritone sax), Pete Newton (bass guitar), Tony Dunmore (bass) and Dave Irving (drums).
Supercharge also quickly established themselves as a major player on the UK college/university circuit. Their first album "Between Music and Madness", which was locally produced, soon followed.
Around 1975, in an attempt to attract a major record label offer, Supercharge began to gig regularly on the London live circuit at venues such as the Hope and Anchor, Islington, the Nashville Rooms, and the Marquee Club. As a result, Supercharge were soon signed by Virgin Records, and with the company's new record producer, Robert "Mutt" Lange, they had a number three hit in Australia with their 1976 single "You've Gotta Get Up and Dance". Personnel on these recordings also included organist Iain Bradshaw. It was also in Australia that their first album, "Local Lads Make Good" went gold - resulting in a number of successful major tours with a version of the band that included Les Karski on guitar.
These live UK gigs often featured celebrated live sound engineer Chrys Lindop, and included the infamous comedy track 'She Moved The Dishes First', which Donnelly claims they wrote so they could mess about a bit while the band were replacing broken guitar strings. This track also achieved notoriety when it was picked up and played regularly by Radio Caroline.
Meanwhile, back in the UK, although their record sales were disappointing, Supercharge still managed to achieve a reputation as one of the UK's best live bands. This included Supercharge's opening set for Queen at the 1976 Hyde Park Festival. However, it was becoming clear to Donnelly that Virgin did not really know what to do with them, and they eventually parted company sometime during the punk era.
Despite their reputation as a killer band live, Richard Branson decided that after two albums without major success that he would only offer Donnelly/Karski a continuous deal. The rest of the band became redundant, and ironically months later the 'Local lads' album went gold in Australia. However, the deed had been done, and Donnelly resorted to taking a scratch band to do the hit tour in Australia much to the chagrin of the original guys who had put all the hard studio and roadwork in to get the band where it was.
Success in Europe.
The next chapter in Supercharge's history was the invasion of Europe, which began at the end of the 1970s-early 1980s. By now the band also featured Andy Parker on vocals and saxophone. Other members (at one time or another) included Mike Snow - trumpet; Dick Hansen - trumpet; John Burke - trumpet Tony Winders - guitar; Phil Loughran - guitar; Tony Judge - piano; Steve Snow - trombone; Paul Ambrosius - bass/vocals; Dave Dover - bass; Kenny Shearer - bass; Dave 'The Frug' Hormbrey - drums; Tony Lunney - drums. Albums during this early period included, "Now Jump", and "Kingsize".
In late 1983, the Liverpool band Juke (Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell - tenor saxophone, guitar, harmonica, bass, vocals; Mickey Kearns - baritone sax; guitar; vocals; Bob Hardy - bandleader, keyboards, guitar, vocals; Dave Sheppley - guitar, bass, vocals; Paddy Chambers - guitar, vocals; Steve Grant - drums, vocal) struck a deal with Donnelly and his then manager, "Memo" Rhein, to work together for the next twelve months as Supercharge '84. This version of the band was so successful that at the end of 1984, Donnelly and Rhein persuaded them to stay on for a further five months.
During the time that Juke and Donnelly were together they managed to clock up well over 200 gigs. Many of these were for Europe's 'Jet-Set', and included the wedding of Tina Onassis (which resulted in the 1984 album "Groovers In Paris" - which is still Supercharge's top selling rhythm and blues album). Gigs also included parties for Gunter Sachs at the Dracula' Club in St. Moritz; and a New Year's Eve party in Marbella for Adnan Khashoggi.
Mid 1980s.
The next version of Supercharge began performing live in mid-1985, and moved away from the successful horn driven 'Rhythm and Blues-Maximum Show' format of Supercharge '84, and instead featured material written mainly by guitarist/vocalist Colin Frost and pianist Tony Judge. This version of the band also included bassist Brendan O'Connor.
In 1986/7, guitarist Dave Shepley (who had been a member of Juke and had switched to bass in Supercharge '84) and guitarist/vocalist John "Fat Ted" Lewis, helped Donnelly to once again convert Supercharge into a major player on the late 1980s and early 1990s European Jazz and Rhythm and Blues live-scene.
This powerhouse rhythm and blues version of Supercharge (which at various times included: Andy Parker - vocal and tenor saxophone; Steve Snow - trombone; Dick Hansen - trumpet Tony Peers - trumpet; Paul Latham - trombone; Graham Price - bass; John "Fat Ted" Lewis - guitar and vocal; Roy "The Boy" Herrington - guitar; Dave Sheppley- guitar; Lenni Zaksen - tenor saxophone; Terry Kennaugh - guitar; Mal Bowers - keyboards; Paul Hetherington - bass; Tony Lunney - drums) quickly began to pick up a number of major tours with artists such as Chuck Berry and B.B. King, and this soon took the band back to stadiums and bigger concert hall gigs, where they still perform.
Nashville keyboard-player and vocalist Greg Barrett joined in the late 1980s and demonstrated a more soulful side of Supercharge. This version of the band usually included Greg Barrett - keyboards, vocal; Albie Donnelly - tenor saxophone; Paul Owens - baritone saxophone; Dick Hansen - trumpet; Roy "The Boy" Herrington - guitar; Wolfgang "Bolle" Diekmann - bass; Tony Lunney - drums.
Donnelly also began experimenting with smaller outfits around this time, the most popular being Albie Donnelly's Big Three which included Gregory Gaynair on piano and Wolfgang Diekmann on bass.
From 2000 to date.
From 2000 to date, Donnelly is still fronting a R&B band - with a version of Supercharge that now consists mainly of a number of top German R&B musicians, including Juergen Wieching on saxophone, and Mike Rafalczyk on trombone and Wolfgang Diekmann on bass..
Donnelly also featured on a CD, "Return Cargo". In addition to Supercharge regulars, the recording also features the original Supercharge drummer, Dave Irving.
Over the years Donnelly has been an official endorser for a number of saxophone companies, including Keilwerth and Yamaha; he has also provided a great deal of regular work for a number of Liverpool's top musicians.
Since 2010 the band line-up has been Albie Donnelly - alto and tenor saxophones, lead vocals; Roy Herrington - guitar, vocals; Jürgen Wieching - baritone and alto saxophones; Mike Rafalcyk - trombone, harmonica; Sascha Kühn - keyboards; Wolfgang Diekmann - bass; Uwe Petersen - drums.
Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell has since gone on to form Merseyside-based sextet "Jazz Junction".

Bank regulation in the United States

Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared with other G10 countries, where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. Depending on the type of charter a banking organization has and on its organizational structure, it may be subject to numerous federal and state banking regulations. Unlike Japan and the United Kingdom (where regulatory authority over the banking, securities and insurance industries is combined into one single financial-service agency), the U.S. maintains separate securities, commodities, and insurance regulatory agencies—separate from the bank regulatory agencies—at the federal and state level.
U.S. banking regulation addresses privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and the promotion of lending to lower-income populations. Some individual cities also enact their own financial regulation laws (for example, defining what constitutes usurious lending).
Regulatory authority.
A bank's primary federal regulator could be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Within the Federal Reserve Board are 12 districts centered around 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, each of which carries out the Federal Reserve Board's regulatory responsibilities in its respective district. Credit unions are subject to most bank regulations and are supervised by the National Credit Union Administration. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) establishes uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the other agencies.
State-chartered banks are also subject to the regulation and supervision of the state regulatory agency of the state in which they were chartered. State regulation of state-chartered banks applies, in addition to federal regulation. For example, a California state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System would be regulated by both the California Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. Likewise, a Nevada state bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System would be jointly regulated by the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve.
State banking laws apply to state-chartered banks and certain non-bank affiliates of federally chartered banks.
By statute, and in accordance with judicial interpretation of statutes and the United States Constitution, federal banking statutes (and the regulations and other guidance issued by federal banking regulatory agencies) often preempt state laws regulating certain activities of nationally chartered banking institutions and their subsidiaries. Specific exceptions to the general rule of federal preemption exist such as some contract law, escheat law, and insurance law.
One example of Office of Thrift Supervision preemption begins with Section 550.136(a) of the OTS Regulations, providing that “...OTS occupies the field of the regulation of the fiduciary activities of Federal savings associations...Accordingly, Federal savings associations may exercise fiduciary powers as authorized under Federal law, including this part, without regard to State laws that purport to regulate or otherwise affect their fiduciary activities, except to the extent provided in 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n)...or in paragraph (c) of this section.” 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n) authorizes fiduciary activities for federal savings associations, and specifies certain state law requirements that are applicable to federal savings associations. Section 550.136(c) lists six types of state laws that, in certain specified circumstances, are not preempted with respect to federal savings associations.
Privacy.
"Regulation P" governs the use of a customer's private data. Banks and other financial institutions must inform a consumer of their policy regarding personal information, and must provide an "opt-out" before disclosing data to a non-affiliated third party. The regulation was enacted in 1999.
Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism.
The "Bank Secrecy Act" (BSA) requires financial institutions to assist government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities.
Section 326 of the "USA PATRIOT Act" allows financial institutions to place limits on new accounts until the account holder's identity has been verified.
"Office of Foreign Assets Control" (OFAC) "sanctions" apply to all U.S. entities including banks. The FFIEC provides guidelines to financial regulators for verifying compliance with the sanctions.
Community reinvestment.
The "Community Reinvestment Act" of 1977 requires insured depository institutions to reinvest in the communities they serve. There should be an emphasis on low-income and moderate-income (LMI) census tracts and individuals. Insured depository institutions must display a CRA notice, and each branch must have a current CRA public file or access to it via the company's intranet, and must provide the information in person or by mail.
Deposit account regulation.
Deposit insurance.
The United States was the second country (after Czechoslovakia) to officially enact deposit insurance to protect depositors from losses by insolvent banks. In 1933 the Glass–Steagall Act established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits at commercial banks.
In 1970 Congress established a separate fund for credit unions, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The NCUSIF insures all federally chartered credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions (98% as of 2009). Some others are insured by the private guaranty corporation American Share Insurance (156 as of 2009). In 1978 foreign banks operating in the United States were required to hold the same level of reserves under the specifications of the International Banking Act.
In 1934, Congress created the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to insure savings and loan deposits. In the 1980s, during the savings and loan crisis, the FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished; its responsibility was transferred to the FDIC.
Some financial institutions offer insurance in excess of FDIC or NCUA limits. For example, the Depositors Insurance Fund insures excess deposits at Massachusetts-chartered savings banks. American Share Insurance provides excess share insurance at participating credit unions.
Consumer protection.
The "Truth in Savings Act" (TISA), implemented by "Regulation DD", established uniformity in disclosing terms and conditions regarding interest and fees when giving out information and when opening a new savings account. On passing the law in 1991, Congress noted it would help promote economic stability, competition between depository institutions, and allow the consumer to make informed decisions.
The "Expedited Funds Availability Act" (EFAA) of 1987, implemented by "Regulation CC", defines when standard holds and exception holds can be placed on checks deposited to checking accounts, and the maximum length of time the money can be held. A bank's hold policy can be less stringent than the guidelines provided, but it cannot exceed the guidelines.
The "Electronic Fund Transfer Act" of 1978, implemented by "Regulation E", established the rights and liabilities of consumers as well as the responsibilities of all participants in electronic funds transfer activities.
Interest on demand deposits.
Until 2011, "Regulation Q" prohibited banks from paying interest on demand deposit accounts. A "demand deposit" account includes many, but not all checking accounts, and does not include Negotiable Order of Withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts).
Lending regulation.
Consumer protection.
The "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act" (HMDA) of 1975, implemented by "Regulation C", requires financial institutions to maintain and annually disclose data about home purchases, home purchase pre-approvals, home improvement, and refinance applications involving one- to four-unit and multifamily dwellings. It also requires branches and loan centers to display a HMDA poster.
The "Equal Credit Opportunity Act" (ECOA) of 1974, implemented by "Regulation B", requires creditors which regularly extend credit to customers—including banks, retailers, finance companies, and bank-card companies—to evaluate candidates on creditworthiness alone, rather than other factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Discrimination based on marital status, receipt of public assistance, and age is generally prohibited (with exceptions), as is discrimination based on a consumer's good-faith exercise of his or her credit-protection rights.
The "Truth in Lending Act" (TILA) of 1968, implemented by "Regulation Z", promotes the informed use of consumer credit by standardizing the disclosure of interest rates and other costs associated with borrowing. TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions involving a lien on the consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit-card practices, and provides a means of resolving credit-billing disputes.
Debt collection.
The "Fair Credit Reporting Act" (FCRA) of 1970 regulates the collection, sharing, and use of customer-credit information. The act allows consumers to obtain a copy of their credit report from credit bureaus that hold information on them, provides for consumers to dispute negative information held and sets time limits, after which negative information is suppressed. It requires that consumers be informed when negative information is added to their credit records, and when adverse action is taken based on a credit report.
Credit cards.
Provisions addressing credit-card practices aim to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards and improve credit-card disclosure under the Truth in Lending Act:
Lending limits.
Lending-limit regulations restrict the total amount of loans and credits that a bank may extend to a single borrower. This restriction is usually stated as a percentage of the bank's capital or assets. For example, a national bank generally must limit its total outstanding loans and credits to any single borrower to no more than 15% of the bank's total capital and surplus. Some state banking regulations also contain similar lending limits applicable to state-chartered banks. Both federal and state laws generally allow for a higher lending limit (up to 25% of capital and surplus for national banks) when the portion of the credit that exceeds the initial lending limit is fully secured.
"Loans to Insiders (Regulation O)" establishes various quantitative and qualitative limits and reporting requirements on extensions of credit made by a bank to its "insiders" or the insiders of the bank's affiliates. The term "insiders" includes executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and the related interests of such parties.
Central banking regulation.
"Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks" (Regulation A) establishes rules regarding discount window lending, the extension of credit by the Federal Reserve Bank to banks and other institutions. The Federal Reserve Board made significant amendments to Regulation A in 2003, including amendments to price certain discount-window lending at above-market rates and to restrict borrowing to banks in generally sound condition. In amending the regulation, the Federal Reserve Board noted that many banks had expressed their unwillingness to use discount-window borrowing because their use of such a funding source was interpreted as sign of the bank's financial weakness or distress. The Federal Reserve Board indicated its hope that the 2003 amendments would make discount window lending a more attractive funding option to banks.
Regulation of bank affiliates and holding companies.
"Transactions Between Member Banks and Their Affiliates (Regulation W)" regulates transactions, such as loans and asset purchases between banks and their affiliates. The term "affiliate" is broadly defined and includes parent companies, companies that share a parent company with the bank, companies that are under other types of common control with the bank (e.g. by a trust), companies with interlocking directors (a majority of directors, trustees, etc. are the same as a majority of the bank's), subsidiaries, and certain other types of companies. When passed September 18, 1950 Regulation W included a prohibition on installment purchases exceeding 21 months, which was shortened to 15 months on October 16 of the same year.

426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron

The 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force fighter squadron. Its last assignment was with the 405th Tactical Training Wing, being inactivated at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, on 19 November 1990.
During World War II, the 426th Night Fighter Squadron was a night fighter squadron assigned to Tenth Air Force in India, and Fourteenth Air Force in China. It was reactivated in 1970 as a tactical fighter Replacement Training Unit (RTU) At Luke AFB.
History.
World War II.
The 426th Night Fighter Squadron was formed at Hammer Field, California, where they trained. The squadron also flew training missions in the Bakersfield area. With their training as a unit completed, the 426th NFS packed their bags and left California's sunny San Joaquin Valley in mid-June 1944.
Their first stop was Newport News, Virginia, where they boarded the USS General A. E. Anderson for India. Arriving on 8 August, they boarded a train that took them to their next stop, Calcutta. Their destination, for a while at least, was Camp Kanchapara, about forty miles from Calcutta. They would have quite a bit of time on their hands, because it wasn't until late September that their P-61 Black Widows arrived by ship in Calcutta.
During this period, some of the ground echelon was sent to Sylhet (now part of Bangladesh), on temporary duty with a combat cargo unit. When P-61s were unloaded on the Calcutta docks, these partially disassembled craft were transported to Barrackpore where they were reassembled by the Air Service Command. Once checked out, the 426th NFS took possession of the planes and flew them to Madhaiganj Air Base. During the next couple of weeks, the planes would be rotated to Ondal, where Air Service Command modified them (one of the modifications being additional radio equipment).
5 October marked the start of the 426th's combat deployment; four aircraft were sent to Chengtu, China, Upon their arrival the mission of the 426th NFS was night defense for the Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortresses based in the Chengtu area. By the end of October 1944 the 426th NFS was at full strength at Chengtu, China. On 27 October, a detachment of the 426th initiated operations out of Kunming, China, where Fourteenth Air Force was headquartered.
Bomber escort missions continued until February 1945, when Japanese night fighter flying against the B-29s nearly ceased. More and more, the squadron flew night intruder missions. The 426th started staging out of Ankang, Liangshan, and Sian (now known as Xi'an), China, from which they attacked communication, motor transport and railway lines until the end of the war.
In September 1945, the 426th returned to India, where some of the squadron left from Karachi (now part of Pakistan) and others from Calcutta, India for their return voyage home. The squadron was inactivated on 8 November 1945.
Cold War.
In 1970, the 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was assigned to the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing at Luke AFB, Arizona from 18 January 1970 until being reassigned to the 405th Tactical Training Wing on 1 January 1981. Squadron carried tail code "LA".
The squadron was initially equipped with the F-100D Super Sabres that it inherited from the provisional 4515th Combat Crew Training Squadron. It received McDonnell F-4C Phantom IIs in August 1971, with aircraft carrying a blue fin cap. In 1981 received F-15A/B Eagles, mission was changed to train interceptor pilots for Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC) with the F-15, which was beginning to replace the F-106 Delta Dart in the air defense mission of the United States. F-15s carried red tail stripes by 1983 and added a yellow centered delta shape. Flew some F-15D models in 1989, was inactivated in 1990 when the air defense training on the F-15 was moved the phased transfer to Tyndall AFB, Florida and to First Air Force.

Mahjoub Mohamed Salih

Mahjoub Mohamed Salih (born 1928/1929) is a journalist from Sudan, which the World Association of Newspapers calls "one of the most restrictive media environments on the African continent". He was awarded the 2005 Golden Pen of Freedom.
Biography.
Salih became a journalist in 1949 after joining the Sudanese independence movement from Egypt. He founded the oldest independent newspaper in Sudan, Al Ayam, in 1958. Twice closed by the Sudanese government during the 1960s, it became a product of it in 1970. Salih did not publish it again until 1986. This was not the end of his troubles with the law, as it was again closed from 1989 to 2000.
In 2003, he began covering the War in Darfur. For this, his newspaper were stopped, punished, and from November 2003 to January 2004, closed down. However, Sudanese authorities claimed it was due to Al-Ayem's failure to pay their taxes. In any case, its journalists have be fined, and sensitive or controversial issues have been confiscated by Sudanese authorities. Salih personally has been incarcerated "numerous" times for publishing such issues.
He received Golden Pen of Freedom in 2005, during the opening ceremonies of the 58th World Newspaper Congress and the 12th World Editors Forum, the global meetings of the Earth's press. It has been awarded annually since 1961 for the stated purpose of "recognis outstanding action by an individual, a group or an institution in the cause of press freedom." In attendance of the ceremony were the President of South Korea, Roh Moo-Hyun, several representatives from the diplomatic community, and over 1,300 journalists, publishers, and editors of newspapers in 82 countries.
In July 2005, Sudanese authorities suspended their censorship of the press. A new law was put into place requiring that they have to take the journalist to court, instead of immediately punishing them. Salih became the application of that law, after Al-Ayam published an article seen as demeaning to the armed forces.

427th Special Operations Squadron

The 427th Special Operations Squadron (427th SOS) is a direct reporting unit of the Air Force Special Operations Command. The unit is assigned to Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina. The squadron is associated with the Central Intelligence Agency Special Operations Group (SOG) which is part of the Special Activities Division (SAD). It performs clandestine missions as part of the Global War on Terrorism, a part of the effort to destroy Al Qaeda.
Mission.
The 427th SOS provides Short Takeoff/Landing (STOL) and tactically qualified crews to support training requirements for the US Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) community. Their customers include the US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), The US Army Special Forces Command (USASFC), and the John F Kennedy Special Warfare Center (JFKSWCS).
The 427th SOS provides US Army SOF personnel the opportunity to train on various types of aircraft for infiltration and exfiltration that they may encounter in the lesser developed countries in which they provide training. The 427th SOS aircrews must be proficient in smaller types of aircraft in order to familiarize US Army personnel with their characteristics, peculiarities, and capabilities.
The Army's 160th SOAR (A) uses rotary wing platforms (MH-60, MH-47, MH-6/AH-6). AFSOC primarily uses fixed-wing aircraft (MC-130, AC-130, CASA-212) with the exception of its MH-53s. The 427th uses non- standard airframes that are usually found in 3rd world or former eastern block nations.
History.
The 427th Night Fighter Squadron was formed at Hammer Field, California, where its crews were trained. The squadron also flew training missions in the Bakersfield area. With their training as a unit completed, personnel of the 427th NFS packed their bags and left California's sunny San Joaquin Valley in mid-July 1944. Initially traveling by ship from the east coast to Casablanca, French Morocco. Once the squadrons' planes were assembled and checked out, the unit flew east to Cairo, Egypt, where they expected orders for Poltava Airfield, Ukraine on the Soviet Eastern Front.
The Russian Front and the Mediterranean.
The expected mission on the Russian Front was to provide night fighter escort and air defense for Eighth and Fifteenth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress bombers on "shuttle" missions from their bases in England and Italy to targets in Eastern Europe as part of Operation Frantic. However, a Luftwaffe night attack on the Soviet Air Force bases where the bombers landed in Ukraine on 21 June 1944 created mass havoc and destroyed many aircraft on the ground. The Soviets refused to allow USAAF night fighters to defend the bomber bases, insisting that air defense was their responsibility, the 427th's orders to Poltava were scrubbed.
Instead, the 427th NFS was to join the four Bristol Beaufighter-equipped night fighter squadrons of the Twelfth Air Force in the Mediterranean area. After about a week's stay in Cairo, the air echelon departed and arrived at the 19th Replacement Depot outside Naples, Italy. Their new assignment was to provide night air defense from Pomigliano Airfield, which started upon their arrival on 3 September. Their stay was short, as on 20 September the 427th was given orders to relocate to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations and join the Tenth Air Force in India.
Although the 427th was in operation in the Naples area for less than three weeks, it was able to fly a number of missions and had contacts with Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft from northern Italy. On one of these missions, a radar malfunction experienced just before coming into firing range prevented possible destruction of the German aircraft. On the other mission in which contact was made, the attack was cut short when the Naples antiaircraft defenses tried to help and nearly shot down the 427th's P-61.
The Far East.
Arriving in India, the squadron cooperated closely with the 426th NFS. The 426th, with only four operational Black Widows, needed additional aircraft for their Chengtu, China operations. A deal was struck between the COs of the two squadrons in which the 427th would give the 426th eight of its twelve aircraft in exchange for the 426th's aircraft at the depot at Karachi, where two were assembled and six were being assembled. At this time the 427th was assigned to Pandaveswar Airfield in West Bengal.
On 28 November another contingent of the 427th NFS arrived at Myitkyina Airfield, Burma. More of the squadron arrived during December, basically by truck over the Ledo Road from their headquarters in India to prepare Myitkyina as the squadron's new headquarters where they would remain until May 1945.
During December, the 427th's small detachment of three P-61s at Myitkyina saw all there was of aerial "action." They participated in seventeen combat missions. Three were patrols ordered by higher headquarters, two were due to enemy aircraft in the area.
On 25 December 1944 a detachment of the 427th NFS arrived at Kunming airport, China, relieving the 426th's detachment, although the bulk of the squadron remained in Burma. During January 1945, they flew patrols over Myitkyina and Bhamo and twelve local tactical interceptions. No enemy aircraft was encountered. Unfortunately for the 427th, one of those misfortunes of war occurred. On 22 January one of its aircraft in the China detachment operating out of Suichwan Airfield in southeast China shot down a US C-87 (a transport version of the Liberator bomber) with a crew of nine. The C-87 was in a prohibited area and made no radio calls, which led to the conclusion that it was hostile.
From this point on, Japanese night flying nearly ceased. The 427th flew more and more night intruder missions. It modified its aircraft to carry a three-tube bazooka-type rocket launcher under
each wing. With its rocket-carrying P-61s, it operated against Japanese forces from its bases at Myitkyina in Burma as well as Kunming in China.
The 427th NFS intruder missions started on 22 February with a sweep of the road network south of Lashio, Burma. The squadron flew seven night intruder sorties that month. In mid-March, day and night offensive reconnaissance missions covering Pangkeyhtu/Loi-lem/Ho-pong/Namsang road network. Thirty-three-day and night patrols were accomplished that month. Missions planned to originate from Kunming and Chihkiang Airfield were curtailed in April because of a shortage of fuel.
Squadron headquarters moved from Burma to Kisselbarri, near Dinjan, India, in late May. The detachment at Kunming China remained there, operating elements from Dinjan Airfield, India; Chengkung and Nanning Airport in China until the war's end. Activity increased in July, with the squadron claiming 155 sampans destroyed and fifty-two damaged in addition to numerous warehouses, barges, trains and trucks destroyed. Besides flying day and night intruder sorties, two special medical supply airdrop sorties were flown in a BT-13 Valiant aircraft.
Post war.
On 13 August 1945, the 427th was ordered to move to Liuchow Airfield, China. The air echelon flew there immediately while the ground echelon began the movement by road. With the war over, the air echelon was ordered to fly to Yangkai Airfield, China, to turn in their aircraft for 'pickling' (preparation for storage) and start processing home. All aircraft were turned in at Yangkai on 29 August. The 427th Night Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 13 October 1945.
The 427th Special Operations Training Squadron was with Tactical Air Command, being assigned to England Air Force Base, Louisiana on 1 July 1970. The squadron's mission was to provide transition training to South Vietnamese Air Force pilots for the OA-37B Dragonfly counterinsurgency aircraft to combat guerrilla type activity. The standard A-37 aircraft was fitted with a refueling probe in the nose; reticulated foam was added to the self-sealing fuel tanks to protect against fire or explosions if hit by incendiary anti-aircraft rounds. The cockpit was armor-plated and the undercarriage was strengthened to carry greater weight and to enable the aircraft to operate off rough remote airstrips. 
The squadron was inactivated on 15 July 1972.

Hanover Square Historic District (Horseheads, New York)

The Hanover Square Historic District is a downtown business district in Horseheads, New York. Most of the buildings in the district were built between 1862 and 1882 in the Romanesque Revival style. The homogeneity of the district is owed to the fact that a fire levelled the town in 1862, allowing for redevelopment in this manner. The brick buildings, with their decorative corbelling, are remarkably intact.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
History.
There was a small village built around a large rock deposited by a glacier by the time General John Sullivan came to the area during the Sullivan Expedition. The Town of Horseheads grew from this small settlement around the rock, into a larger town. Later expansions away from the square produced the 1855 Extension Historic District.

Memorial Stadium (Kent)

Memorial Stadium was a stadium in Kent, Ohio, USA on the campus of Kent State University that served as home of the Kent State Golden Flashes football and track and field teams from 1950 through the 1968 season. Although Kent State had fielded a football team since 1920, Memorial Stadium was the team's first stadium as they had previously played on a field behind Merrill Hall in the old section of campus. The stadium opened on October 14, 1950 with a 57-0 victory over Marietta College and was later expanded in the mid-1950s with additional permanent and auxiliary seating. Rather than demolish the stadium, the university instead dismantled most of Memorial Stadium's bleachers and reconstructed them in a new configuration at the current Dix Stadium (also known as Memorial Stadium until 1971) site. The main sideline bleachers became the end zone seats at the new stadium while the auxiliary seating formed the east side bleachers.
Site today.
The site of Memorial Stadium today serves as the main visitor parking lot adjacent to the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center and the Kent State student center. Of the pieces of the original stadium, only one still remains in use at Dix Stadium. Dix Stadium's current north end zone seating was the original south sideline seating area at Memorial Stadium, though prior to the 2007 season the original press box was removed and the entire seating area was repainted. The auxiliary seating areas at Memorial Stadium, which served as the east stands at Dix Stadium, were torn down after the 2001 season and were replaced in time for the 2003 season. In February 2008, the south end zone bleachers, the original north sideline seats at Memorial Stadium, were razed as part of Dix Stadium's most recent upgrades.

Edward Jakobowski

Edward Jakobowski (17 April 1856 – 29 April 1929) was an English composer best known for writing the comic opera "Erminie".
Life and career.
Jakobowski was born in Islington, London. At age six, he moved to Vienna, Austria, where he was given a musical education. In the late 1870s he moved to Paris for three years. In 1881, he returned to London.
Jakobowski's most successful work by far, "Erminie", opened in 1885 in London and was revived and toured internationally, playing with extraordinary success on Broadway from 1886. None of his other works had more than a short run or two. For two Victorian burlesques, "The Three Beggars" (1883) and "Little Carmen" (1884), Jakobowski used the pen name Edward Belville. His principal shows were "Dick" (1884, based on the story of Dick Whittington; libretto: Alfred Murray), "The Lady of the Locket" (1885), "Erminie", "The Palace of Pearl" (1886), "Mynheer Jan" (1887; libretto: Paulton), "Paola" (1889; libretto: Paulton), "La Rosiére" (1893, in one act), "The Queen of Brilliants" (1894; libretto: Brandon Thomas, starring Lillian Russell), "The Devil's Deputy" (1894; libretto: J Cheever Goodwin), "Milord Sir Smith" (1898, originally titled "Cumpano"; libretto O'Day and Adrian Ross), "Tarantella" (1899; libretto: Alfred Murray) and "Winsome Winnie" (1903). He was one of eight composers who contributed to "Pat" in 1892.
Two short operettas in 1893 with libretti by B. C. Stephenson, "The Improvisatore" and "A Venetian Singer", made little impact. Jakobowski was married twice, the second of which ended in divorce in 1901 after just two years. In 1902, he was declared bankrupt with debts of £1,090 (£ in adjusted for inflation)
He died in Friern Barnet, north London, in 1929.

Flood (Baxter novel)

Published in 2008, Flood is the work of hard science fiction by English author Stephen Baxter. It describes a near future world where deep submarine seismic activity leads to seabed fragmentation, and the opening of deep subterranean reservoirs of water. Human civilisation is almost destroyed by the rising inundation, which covers Mount Everest in 2052. Baxter issued a sequel to this work, entitled "Ark", in 2009.
"Flood" was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award in 2008.
Synopsis.
The above effects are catastrophic, and exceed current estimates of climate change-related sea level rise. In the opening chapter, four main characters (former USAF Captain Lily Brooke, British military officer Piers Michaelmas, English tourist Helen Gray, and NASA scientist Gary Boyle) are liberated by a private megacorporation called AxysCorp from a Christian extremist Catalonian terrorist bunker in Barcelona in 2016, after five years of captivity. AxysCorp was hoping to save a fifth prisoner, John Foreshaw, but he was executed minutes before the rescue. Nonetheless, the corporation continues to look after the four hostages and search for Helen's daughter, Grace, who was conceived in captivity by the son of a Saudi royal and taken by his family. Helen befriends Foreign Office official Michael Thurley in the hopes of finding her daughter, and the four rescued hostages make a pact to keep in contact.
At this point, sea level changes have already submerged Tuvalu, a low lying South Pacific island, whose inhabitants have been evacuated to New Zealand, and London and Sydney are prone to constant flooding. However, as a tidal surge hits London and Sydney, killing hundreds of thousands in both cities, scientists become aware that this cannot be explained solely by the consequences of climate change. American oceanographer Thandie Jones uncovers the truth – through deep sea diving missions to oceanic ridges and trenches reveal that the seabed has fragmented, and there is turbulence that can only be attributable to the infusion of vast subterranean reservoirs of hitherto hypothesised but undetected oceanic masses of water.
Over the next three decades, ocean waters rise exponentially and inundate the whole world, as the main characters struggle for survival in a vast and continuously altering environment. Lily and her sister Amanda, as well as her children Benj and Kristie experience the flooding and abandonment of London. Amanda and her children settle into a refugee resettlement in Dartmoor, but the rising floodwaters make that only a temporary respite. In 2019, a tsunami obliterates western coastal cities in England, Scotland and Wales killing Helen Gray and tens of thousands of others. At the same time, New York is demolished by an Atlantic tidal wave (with hundreds of thousands killed in New York and the city levelled in the process), and Washington, D.C. is evacuated. For the next twenty years, Denver becomes the capital of the steadily diminishing United States, which fragments as individual states assert their own survival needs.
By 2020, much of the eastern United States is underwater, as well as Sacramento, California, on its western coast. AxysCorp CEO Nathan Lammockson, the man who ordered the main characters' rescue and indirect friend of Lily, has a contingency plan for survival of an affluent western minority, which involves evacuation to the mountainous Peruvian Andes. Lily, Amanda with her children, and Piers tag along to the settlement, where Nathan discloses that he is aware of the extent of global inundation, which will not stop until all land on Earth is submerged, apart from the Greenland and eastern Antarctica ice sheets. As the United States is eroded away, a contingent of refugees which includes Gary, Thandie, and Grace, heads south to meet Lily. When they reach Nathan's 'Project City' in Peru, they are swept up in a revolt that tries to seize control of the former elite settlement which results in the deaths of Amanda, Benj, and Kristie's husband, Ollantay, a self-claimed Inca descendant who leads the revolt. Gary parts ways with Lily as he hands over Grace, so they, along with Piers and Kristie board Nathan's "Ark Three", a "Queen Mary" sized (and shaped) ocean vessel that sets sail in 2035. By then, little of Western Europe, Russia, the Americas, Oceania and Africa remain above the water.
Ark Three sails the global ocean in search for trading and finding higher ground, despite running into skirmishes with pirates that lead to Lily falling overboard and staying on a submarine with Thandie for a year, the survivors head for Tibet. However, when they arrive, Nepal's Maoist rulers have devastating news – Tibet is ruled by a Khmer Rouge-like regime that practices human slavery and cannibalism. Ark Three heads back out to sea but has nowhere to go, given that the floods are now lapping around the Rocky Mountains. Seaborn piracy is rife from those refugee seaborn populations who have taken to scavenging the refuse from the posthumous remains of human civilisation; and after a visit to coastal Colorado, the pirates ultimately board and destroy Ark Three. By this time, over five billion people have perished from the floods.
By 2048, the Andes, Rocky Mountains and elsewhere have been submerged. Tibet's regime is no more, and Australia, North America, South America, Africa, and most of Asia except for the highest mountains in the Himalayas have been flooded. As Lily, Gary, and Thandie settle into life as sea-dwelling survivors; Piers, Nathan, and Kirstie die in staggered succession since the sinking of Ark Three. The novel ends in 2052, as a group of survivors watch the submergence of the peak of Mount Everest. Lily has survived, and wonders what the grandchildren of her late-sister's family and her old hostage comrades from three decades ago will make of post-deluge Earth, now at a new environmental equilibrium, with a vast global storm system that is reminiscent of those on Jupiter and Neptune.
Civilization is virtually dead at the novel's end. Survivors continue to exist only on the rafts and some decrepit surviving former navy vessels. The children of the rafts, raised on the water, start building their own aquatic culture. By the end of the novel, extinction seems certain for humanity on Earth. However, we learn later in the book that Ark Three (the aforementioned ocean liner) was one of many projects created by AxysCorp and a few other groups. One of these (Ark One) was a starship project, which was taken over by the remnant government of the United States, and launched as Denver flooded in 2041; and at that time earlier in the novel, Lily had managed to get Grace aboard it just before it launched, and at the time she was unwillingly pregnant with the child of Nathan's snobbish and estranged son, Hammond. In 2044, a lunar eclipse occurs, just as a massive burst of light is sighted near Jupiter and the survivors realise it must be Ark One, and Grace's survival is thus ensured.
As they prepare to leave the former site of Mount Everest Lily realises something. She sailed on Ark Three, and Ark One is a starship. In closing, she asks "What is Ark Two?" The question ends the novel, and sets the scene for Baxter's sequel, "Ark," in which it is resolved.
"Hard Science" basis for novel.
In a short afterword, Baxter claims to have based his work on a hypothesis related to possible subterranean oceans within the Earth's mantle. His other references are cursory, although one refers to the presence of such immense reservoirs approximately below Beijing.

1976 Chatham Cup

The 1976 Chatham Cup was the 49th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the later stages of the competition. In all, 146 teams took part in the competition - a record for the time. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.
The 1976 final.
Christchurch United, coached by Terry Conley, became only the second team (after Waterside in 1938-40) to win the cup on three successive occasions. Seven players played on all three winning sides, among them future New Zealand captain Steve Sumner. Three of these players (Graham Griffiths, Brian Hardman, and Ian Park) had also played in Christchurch United's winning side in the 1972 final.
The final against Eastern Suburbs was a one-sided affair (United had had a harder task in their semi-final against Blockhouse Bay). The South Island side scored four, though the first of these was an own goal by Suburbs' Tom Bell. Norman Moran picked up a brace before the scolring was completed by Mark McNaughton.

Power Rangers RPM is the seventeenth season of the American children's television series Power Rangers. As with all previous Power Rangers series, "RPM" uses footage, costumes, and other props from the Super Sentai Series, in this case, from "Engine Sentai Go-onger". With the re-branding of Jetix to Disney XD, all Power Rangers shows were dropped from the channel in the United States and "RPM" was only broadcast during the ABC Kids block on ABC stations. It was the final season to be distributed by Disney and Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment before the franchise was re-acquired by Haim Saban and his company Saban Capital Group. RPM has a much more mature and darker tone in comparison to some past seasons of Power Rangers, which includes several death scenes. 
Story.
An AI computer virus called Venjix takes over all of the Earth's computers, rendering all communication useless while creating an army of robot droids to try to destroy virtually every city in the world. Humanity's last known safe and stable city became the domed metropolis of Corinth. Surrounded by Venjix's forces and a force field, it is nearly impossible to enter without luck or firepower. When the force field is lowered to allow surviving humans into the sanctuary, Doctor K's RPM Power Rangers fight Venjix's forces to protect Corinth from being destroyed.
The "Power Rangers Samurai" two-part episode "Clash of the Red Rangers", a crossover with "RPM", establishes that "RPM" is actually in an Alternate Timeline to the other seasons of the "Power Rangers" franchise.
Production.
Australian actor Eka Darville, who previously starred in series three of "Blue Water High", was reported to have a role in September 2008 in what was then unknown as "RPM" or "Racing Performance Machines" which began production in September 2008 in New Zealand. He is still cast as the Red Ranger, Scott Truman. Heidi Kathy Bradhurt had been cast as an extra, but her profile initially listed her as the Yellow Ranger, named "Kayla," whose name and actress has since been changed to "Summer" played by Rose McIver. Daniel Ewing had been reported in November 2008 to be playing a major character named "Dillon," revealed to be the Black Ranger. Other cast members include Murray Keane in the role of "Benny," Charlie McDermott voicing "General Crunch," and Jason Hoyte as a guest role named "Mr. McAllistair."
An article of "The New Zealand Herald" reported that "Power Rangers RPM" was to be the final season of the "Power Rangers" series. Production manager Sally Campbell stated in an interview "...at this stage we will not be shooting another season". A September 1, 2009, revision to "" by Disney's head archivist Dave Smith states that production of new episodes of "Power Rangers" ceased in 2009. A re-version of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" began broadcasting in early 2010 instead. 
However, in mid-2010, Haim Saban's Saban Brands bought the Power Rangers franchise back from Disney and production was restarted during that year for a 2011 series.

María Candelaria

María Candelaria is a 1943 Mexican film directed by Emilio Fernández and starring Dolores del Río and Pedro Armendáriz. It was the first Mexican film to be screened at the Cannes International Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix becoming the first Latin American country to do so. "María Candelaria" would later win a Silver Ariel award for Best Cinematography.
The film came to be regarded as one of Fernández's best works in which he portrays the indigenous people of Mexico with innocence and dignity. Fernández has said that he wrote an original version of the plot on 13 napkins while sitting in a restaurant. He was anxious because he was dating Dolores del Río and could not afford to buy her a birthday present. The film was first entitled Xochimilco and the protagonist was named María del Refugio.
Major themes in the film include melodrama, indigenousness, nationalism, and the beauty of Mexico. "María Candelaria" is one of Mexico's most beloved films of all time, and was ranked thirty-seventh among the top 100 films of Mexican cinema.
Plot.
A young journalist presses an old artist (Alberto Galán) to show portrait of a naked indigenous woman that he has in his study. The body of the movie is a flashback to Xochimilco, Mexico, in 1909. The film is set right before the Mexican Revolution, and Xochimilco is an area with beautiful landscapes inhabited mostly by indigenous people.
The viewer learns that the woman in the painting is María Candelaria (Dolores del Río), a young Indian woman who is constantly rejected by her own people for being the daughter of a prostitute. She and her lover, Lorenzo Rafael (Pedro Armendáriz), face constant struggles throughout the film. They are honest and hardworking, yet nothing ever goes right for them. Don Damian (Miguel Inclán), a jealous Mestizo store owner who wants María for himself, prevents them from getting married. He kills a piglet that María and Lorenzo plan to sell for profit and he refuses to buy vegetables from them. When María falls ill with malaria, Don Damian refuses to give the couple the quinine medicine necessary to fight the disease. Lorenzo breaks into his shop to steal the medicine, and he also takes a wedding dress for María. Lorenzo goes to prison for stealing, and María agrees to model for the painter to pay for his release. The artist begins painting a portrait of María, but when he asks her to pose nude she refuses.
The artist finishes the painting with the nude body of another woman. When the people of Xochimilco see the painting, they assume it is María Candelaria and stone her to death.
Finally, Lorenzo escapes from prison to carry María's lifeless body through Xochimilco's canal of the dead.

Other characters
Production.
"María Candelaria" benefited from a time of commercial success in the Mexican film industry in the 1940s and 1950s. Fernández and Figueroa had worked together previously, and they shared a similar vision for the film. In addition to the experienced team of producers, the film benefited from Dolores del Río's success as an actress through the star system.
The film was the gift that Emilio Fernández offered to Dolores del Río, to compensate for his mistreatment of del Río during their filming of "Flor silvestre" (1943). Emilio's "bronco" temperament had surfaced on several occasions, and the actress had nearly left the film. The pleas of their co-workers, and her high sense of professionalism, convinced del Río to return. However, her relationship with the director had become distant. On Good Friday 1943, del Río's birthday, was the occasion chosen by the filmmaker to find the desired reconciliation. In addition to needing her as an actress, Fernández began to love her as a woman. In his biographical account of the actress, writer David Ramón relates:
"When it was Emilio Fernández's turn to give her his gift, he got close up to Dolores and took a bunch of napkins with writings, and he practically threw them to her and said: This is your birthday present, a history of cinema. I hope you'll like it, it's your next film, it's called Xochimilco. It's yours, it's your property, if somebody wants to buy it, they'll buy it from you."
With the generous gift and all, Dolores had her doubts. She said: "First a rural woman ... And now, an Indian woman, you want me to play an indian? I ... barefooted?"

Double tangent bundle

In mathematics, particularly differential topology, the double tangent bundle or the second tangent bundle refers to the tangent bundle of the total space "TM" of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold "M"
. A note on notation: in this article, we denote projection maps by their domains, e.g., "π""TTM" : "TTM" → "TM". Some authors index these maps by their ranges instead, so for them, that map would be written "π""TM".
The second tangent bundle arises in the study of connections and second order ordinary differential equations, i.e., (semi)spray structures on smooth manifolds, and it is not to be confused with the second order jet bundle.
Secondary vector bundle structure and canonical flip.
Since is a vector bundle on its own right, its tangent bundle has the secondary vector bundle structure where is the push-forward of the canonical projection 
In the following we denote
and apply the associated coordinate system
on "TM". Then the fibre of the secondary vector bundle structure at "X"∈"T""x""M" takes the form
The canonical flip is a smooth involution "j":"TTM"→"TTM" that exchanges these vector space structures
in the sense that it is a vector bundle isomorphism between and In the associated coordinates on "TM" it reads as
The canonical flip has the property that for any "f": R2 → "M", 
where "s" and "t" are coordinates of the standard basis of R 2. Note that both partial derivatives are functions from R2 to "TTM".
This property can, in fact, be used to give an intrinsic definition of the canonical flip. Indeed, there is a submersion
"p": J20 (R2,M) → "TTM" given by 
where "p" can be defined in the space of two-jets at zero because only depends on "f" up to order two at zero. We consider the application:
where α("s","t")= ("t","s"). Then "J" is compatible with the projection "p" and induces the canonical flip on the quotient "TTM".
Canonical tensor fields on the tangent bundle.
As for any vector bundle, the tangent spaces of the fibres "T""x""M" of the tangent bundle can be identified with the fibres "T"x"M" themselves. Formally this is achieved though the vertical lift, which is a natural vector space isomorphism
The vertical lift can also be seen as a natural vector bundle isomorphism
from the pullback bundle of over onto the vertical tangent bundle 
The vertical lift lets us define the canonical vector field
which is smooth in the slit tangent bundle "TM"\0. The canonical vector field can be also defined as the infinitesimal generator of the Lie-group action
Unlike the canonical vector field, which can be defined for any vector bundle, the canonical endomorphism
is special to the tangent bundle. The canonical endomorphism "J" satisfies
and it is also known as the tangent structure for the following reason. If ("E","p","M") is any vector bundle
with the canonical vector field "V" and a (1,1)-tensor field "J" that satisfies the properties listed above, with "VE" in place of "VTM", then the vector bundle ("E","p","M") is isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the base manifold, and "J" corresponds to the tangent structure of "TM" in this isomorphism.
There is also a stronger result of this kind which states that if "N" is a 2"n"-dimensional manifold and if there exists a (1,1)-tensor field "J" on "N" that satisfies
then "N" is diffeomorphic to an open set of the total space of a tangent bundle of some "n"-dimensional manifold "M", and "J" corresponds to the tangent structure of "TM" in this diffeomorphism.
In any associated coordinate system on "TM" the canonical vector field and the canonical endomorphism have the coordinate representations
(Semi)spray structures.
A Semispray structure on a smooth manifold "M" is by definition a smooth vector field "H" on "TM" \0 such that "JH"="V". An equivalent definition is that "j"("H")="H", where "j":"TTM"→"TTM" is the canonical flip. A semispray "H" is a spray, if in addition, ["V","H"]="H".
Spray and semispray structures are invariant versions of second order ordinary differential equations on "M". The difference between spray and semispray structures is that the solution curves of sprays are invariant in positive reparametrizations as point sets on "M", whereas solution curves of semisprays typically are not.
Nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds.
The canonical flip makes it possible to define nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds as follows. Let
be an Ehresmann connection on the slit tangent bundle "TM"/0 and consider the mapping
where "Y"*:"TM"→"TTM" is the push-forward, "j":"TTM"→"TTM" is the canonical flip and κ:"T"("TM"/0)→"TM"/0 is the connector map. The mapping "D""X" is a derivation in the module Γ ("TM") of smooth vector fields on "M" in the sense that
Any mapping "D""X" with these properties is called a (nonlinear) covariant derivative
The term "nonlinear" refers to the fact that this kind of covariant derivative "D""X" on is not necessarily linear with respect to the direction "X"∈"TM"/0 of the differentiation.
Looking at the local representations one can confirm that the Ehresmann connections on ("TM"/0,π"TM"/0,"M") and nonlinear covariant derivatives on "M" are in one-to-one correspondence. Furthermore, if "D""X" is linear in "X", then the Ehresmann connection is linear in the secondary vector bundle structure, and "D""X" coincides with its linear covariant derivative if and only if the torsion of the connection vanishes.

Stonewall Jackson High School (Kanawha County, West Virginia)

Stonewall Jackson High School is a former high school in Kanawha County, West Virginia. It opened in 1940 and closed in 1989. It was located on the West Side in Charleston, West Virginia. In 1989, Stonewall Jackson High School and Charleston High School consolidated to become Capital High School. It is now a middle school.
It is named after the Civil War general Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson.
History.
In the late 1930s, Charleston High School became over-crowded so Stonewall Jackson High School was built in 1940 to accommodate the students on the West Side of Charleston. During the 1980s, the student populations at CHS and SJHS dropped. In 1989, Capital High School opened, combining the students of these two former rival schools. This ended a 49 year rivalry. 
Charleston High School was torn down in mid 1989. Stonewall Jackson High School became Stonewall Jackson Junior High School that same year. A decade later, in 1999, Stonewall Jackson Junior High School became Stonewall Jackson Middle School, which it remains today. Stonewall Jackson Middle School is a feeder school, along with Horace Mann Middle School, for Capital High School.
During Stonewall Jackson High's time, the school participated in the Daily Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival. Although the school never won the festival grand championship, it had six majorettes named Miss Kanawha Majorette. The majorettes were:

George de Roerich

George Nicolas de Roerich (Russian: Юрий Николаевич Рёрих, ) (August 16, 1902, Okulovka – May 21, 1960, Moscow) was a prominent 20th century Tibetologist. His name at birth was Yuri Nikolaevich Rerikh. George's work encompassed many areas of Tibetan studies, but in particular he is known for his contributions to Tibetan dialectology, his monumental translation of the "Blue Annals", and his 11-volume Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary (published posthumously).
George was the son of the painter and explorer Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich.
Early life.
Much of Roerich's early life was spent in Saint Petersburg. His brother, Svetoslav Roerich, was born in 1904. Both sons' interests were nurtured by their mother, who wrote of her oldest son's childhood: "The elder one showed love for history and tin soldiers. He had thousands of them. His passion for the art of war has survived until now. Strategy is his pet subject. By the way, this talent is inborn, and he is very proud of his ancestor - field-marshall Mikhail Kutuzov, the hero of the war of 1812."
Education.
By the time Roerich was 15, he had already begun studying Egyptology with Boris Turayev and Mongolian language and history with Andrei Dmitryevich Rudnyev. He was a student with broad interests and many talents. After finishing his studies at Karl May School, he entered the Indian and Iranian department of Oriental Languages at London University in 1918. Under Indologist Professor Edward Denison Ross he studied Sanskrit and Pali. He was recognized for his language abilities and was introduced as the best Sanskrit student to the Secretary of State for Indian Affairs who visited the university. 
Upon completion of his study at London University in 1920, he moved to America with his parents. He studied in the Indian Philology Department of Harvard University and also studied Pali Chinese languages during his time there. At the age of 18, Roerich was already firmly rooted in his passion for Oriental studies. He mastered Sanskrit during his time at Harvard under the direction of Professor Charles Rockwell Lanman, whose comparative grammar lessons made a lifelong impact on George's future studies. Roerich also attended lectures by Professor Michael Rostovtzeff on Middle Asia influences in the art of southern Russia. During his years at Harvard, he wrote his first essay on Buddhism and studied classical Chinese. He received both a Bachelor and Master degree from Harvard University, then continued his education in Paris, France. 
He spent the years 1922-1923 at Paris University in Sorbonne, working in the Department of Middle Asian, Indian and Mongol-Tibetan Studies and studying in the Military Department as well as the Department of Law and Economy. During his time here, he cooperated with such famous orientalists as Paul Pelliot and Sylvain Lévi. He learned Mongolian and Tibetan while also continuing his study of Chinese and Persian languages. He graduated with his M.A. in Indian Philology in 1923.
Career.
Early Work.
Roerich began his independent research at the age of 21. In November 1923 he left for Bombay with his family. After years of study and preparation, his dream of going to India came true. By December 1923, he had arrived at the base of the Himalayas as a member of a scientific expedition to Sikkim. The purpose of this expedition was to visit ancient monuments and Buddhist monasteries, as well as to record local legends, beliefs and artistic traditions. In Darjeeling, George polished his colloquial Tibetan with scholar Lama L.M. Dorje, who also guided him in the study of Tibetan Art. Roerich found strong similarities between ancient Russian icon painting and the art of tankha painting in both technique and in the treatment of the subject. He wrote: "Indeed, it seems that the Russian icon art and the Tibetan pictorial art derive their methods of work from a common source... Thus we often see on Tibetan paintings the principal figures enthroned on an island (this being usually the case when Buddha or Bodhisattva is represented). Similar images are frequently found on Russian icons..." In 1925, Roerich published his first book entitled 'Tibetan Paintings' in which he attempted to define Tibetan art, its history, and the three existing schools of art in Tibet. David Jackson in his 'A history of Tibetan painting' acknowledged that in the Western scholarship, "the earliest account of Tibetan paintings styles... was that of George Roerich".
Central Asian Expedition.
The Roerich family embarked on an ambitious journey throughout Central Asia in 1925. This journey began in India and lasted four years. It was a crucial time in George Roerich's career as a scientist and he began his study of ancient pre-Buddhist doctrine of Bon and the translation of its manuscript. Despite the difficulties of travel and political instability, Roerich managed to make several important discoveries during this expedition, including previously unknown materials about the Tibetan Epic of King Gesar. Another important discovery was that the animal style that was used by nomads who had migrated from Central Asia to South Russia in the 7th and 8th centuries B.C.E. could also be found amongst Northern Tibetan nomads. Roerich believed that, "All art objects made in animal style found and described by the expedition clearly proved the existence of ancient Central Asian art amongst nomads of Tibet."
His role as translator was invaluable to the group as they traveled. Roerich could speak Mongolian and Tibetan fluently, in addition to many other Central Asian languages. Despite his young age, he was given the task of guarding the group's safety. Here, his knowledge of military tactics from his university study proved useful and his tactical skills and courage saved their caravan on more than one occasion. His study of the geography, archeology, ethnology, and linguistics during the expedition formed the basis of his work "Trails to Inmost Asia", which was published in 1930. This publication put the young orientalist on par with the famous researchers of Central Asia, such as Nikolay Przhevalsky, Grigory Potanin, Pyotr Kozlov, and Sven Hedin. 
Of this lengthy and challenging journey, Roerich later said, "The expedition headed by Professor Nicholas Roerich, organized by the Roerich Museum in New York and International Centre of Art “Corona Mundi” had as its main task creation of the unique pictorial panorama of the lands and nations of Inmost Asia.
The second task, was research of the possibilities of the new archaeological excavations, and thus, preparation of the ways for the future expeditions in this region. The third task was research of the languages and dialects of Central Asia, and gathering a big collection of objects, that depict spiritual culture of these nations. Central Asia has been a cradle and a meeting place of many Asian civilizations, and inaccessible mountain valleys till our days preserved many invaluable linguistic and ethnographic materials, which can help to reconstruct the past of Asia."
Himalayan Research Institute.
The plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named 'Urusvati' in Darjeeling in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to Naggar in Kulu Valley. The center engaged in scientific exchange with 285 institutes, universities, museums, and libraries around the world. Roerich collaborated with Tibetan scholars and published the Tibetan English Dictionary in 1934. One of his main focuses for the center was to bring people to the institute who practiced and lived the cultures being examined by the center. He was the director of the institute for 10 years.
Manchuria Expedition.
In 1934 – 1935, Roerich undertook an expedition with his father to Manchuria and Inner Mongolia which was organized by the US Department of Agriculture for the purpose of collecting seeds of drought resistant plants that would help prevent erosion of soils and the spreading of pests. In addition to gaining purely scientific knowledge, this expedition also had a social and cultural aim: to create wider agricultural cooperation and public collaboration. Professor Nicholas Roerich led the expedition while George Roerich was the assistant and responsible for the medicinal research. They gathered a collection of drought resistant plants, herbs, and soil, as well as a valuable list of traditional medicinal treatments. Roerich made maps and conducted a photo survey of the region in which the expedition took place. In 1935, the research from the expedition was transferred back to India and the Roerichs returned to Kulu Valley in October 1935.
Later life.
After the Manchuria expedition, Roerich spent many years living in India. His father, Nicholas Roerich, died in 1947. Due to political unrest in the area Roerich moved with his mother, Helena Roerich, from their home in Nagger to Kalimpong where he lived until 1956. Helena Roerich died in 1955 and in 1957 Roerich returned to Russia. Before his return to his homeland, Roerich participated in several important projects. He collaborated with Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark and R. Sanskrtyayana to translate the Buddhist text 'Pramanavaartikam' from Tibetan into Sanskrit. Working with Tse-Trung Lopsang Phuntshok he wrote 'Textbook of Colloquial Tibetan.' He translated the lengthy pioneering work on Tibetan history, Blue Annals, which was published in two volumes by the Asiatic Society in 1949 and 1954.
After spending almost 30 years in India Roerich returned in 1957 to Soviet Russia, where he made efforts to revive the Russian School of Oriental Studies. As the Head of the Indology Department in the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, he resumed editing of 'Bibliotheca Buddhica.' This was a series devoted to the publication of Buddhist texts and monographs on the subject, started in 1897 by Prof. S.F. Oldenburg. In this same series A.I. Vostrikov's 'Tibetan Historical Literature' and 'Dhammapada' were also translated from Pali. 
His return to Russia and acquisition of Soviet citizenship was courageous as the USSR's opinion of his family was rather distorted. Because of his effort, bans were lifted on everything associated with the Roerich family name and the legacy of research left by the family was preserved. The first of his father's exhibitions was organized in Moscow in 1958, then spread to Leningrad, Riga, Kiev, Tbilisi, and other cities. He was able to dispel myths about the family's philosophy of Agni Yoga and start a cultural movement using this philosophy to spread "living ethics" in the USSR. 
Roerich died on May 21, 1960, at the age of 58 and his ashes were placed in Moscow, at the New Maiden Cemetery.

Gargoyle Mechanique

Gargoyle Mechanique was originally the name of a group of collaborating art inventors (Steve Jones, Doug "Bert' Kennedy, Matt Crowe, David Landazuri and brother Roberto Landazuri were the principals) in San Francisco in the late 1970s, and later to be the name of an inter-media art space and theater, music, radio, sculpture, art and film collective serially located at various basements and storefronts in New York City's East Village through the 80's into the 1990s.
1980-1988. The Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory was located initially at Second Ave and 4th st. where musician Steve Jones had moved after leaving San Francisco, but by 1982 had established itself at 69 First Ave in the East Village and was known locally as "The Basement". Principal artistic collaborators: Jones, Jeanne Liotta, Nick Markovich, Carmen Waldorf. Among the creative activities produced during this early fertile period was the Studio Verite Recording studio (6.66 /hr),the kabuki rock n roll band Door of Wigs (Jones, cassette tapes/Chevy guitar, Markovich, vocals, Liotta, percussion/vocals, Carlo Altomare, keyboards, rotating bass players) playing venues of the period such as the Mudd Club, CBGB's, and The Gas Station. Production of Super 8 films/performances, such as Camptown Races and radio plays such as "House of Dogs" written by Markovich after Stendhal, Shelley, and Artaud, recorded by Jones and featuring Waldorf and Liotta. "House of Dogs" was excerpted on the Telus audio cassette magazine #11 "The Sound of Radio" and was performed live with food music projections and actors at East Village club 8BC in 1984. This same year Liotta and Jones gave birth to daughter Chloe Liotta-Jones. Her 3rd birthday party at Gargoyle Mechanique's backyard alley was captured in Super8 sound by Markovich and is preserved for posterity on The Center for Home Movies ("Living Room Cinema"). Markovich also wrote the play CAKE, a cosmic comedy starring Waldorf, Liotta, and Ed Snyder with slide projections by Liotta and original tape score by Jones, and was performed at the New York Theatre Asylum on E. 9th st run by Raquel Shapira and Tri Garrity. Gargoyle Mechanique had a retrospective of this period of music,film, performance, and projected photoglyphs "from the beautiful to the backwards" at the Collective for Living Cinema Collective for Living Cinema on White St in NYC in 1987.
From 1989-1993, in NYC, the Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory was located at 28 Ave B. The thriving art space brought together, and was run by a group of artists, filmmakers and musicians, including Tim Sweet, Loyan Beausoleil, Beth Grim, Kit Krash, Sheila Smyth, Fly, Zero Boy, and Bulk Foodveyor, though led by Steve Jones (now Jones Daughs).
The September 16, 1992, New York Press 'Best of' issue, named The Gargoyle Mechanique as the "Best 70's Performance Gallery," calling it, "not quite communist, it's not quite socialist, and it might be but it might not be exactly communal, and the only thing that stops it from being anarchist is that they have to pay rent." Harold Goldberg described the Gargoyle in his 1990 Village Voice article, "We shudder at the fiery blood-red walls, the "Addams Family" furniture, the phantom performers in the smoky half-light, the hooks, webs, and weeds hanging from the ceiling of this cabaret space. The Gargoyle is pure horror out of control." But in the same article it quotes Gargoyle co-directors describing the purpose of the space, "We like to stimulate brains," grins Steve (Jones). "The entire body!" corrects Loyann (Beausoleil).
A Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory brochure from 1992 lists various artists and events that took place in the 28 Ave B space, including the Sunday Night Open Stage, which began after the Sunday night open mic at ABC No Rio stopped taking place. Produced by this group of diverse artist collaborators, the weekly event set an unusually high bar for live entertainment production values of an Open Mic event, with ever-changing stage designs, lighting, projections, sound-scape and audio effects, always with the goal of supporting and expanding performers' intentions. Many well known East Village performers, including Roger Manning, Fly (artist), Lach, Paleface, John S. Hall, and Brenda Kahn were regulars at this Sunday night event. Internationally known artists, sculptors, poets, musicians and inspired thinkers have also shared their expressions in GMLab, from Allen Ginsberg to Jivamukti Yoga founders David Life and Sharon Gannon to Timothy Leary to John Perry Barlow of the Grateful Dead and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. According to an article in the New York Post, John F. Kennedy, Jr and Daryl Hannah also visited the space. All in all, hundreds of artists from around the country and the world shared their expression at Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory, though music, theater, installation art, exhibitions, group shows, intermedia, computer-based works, and early online media.
The name Gargoyle Mechanique was partly inspired by a museum of antique mechanical toys and contraptions on the pacific coast of San Francisco named Le Musee Mecanique. The name Gargoyle Mechanique was devised in 1978 by the team in San Francisco, originally for the purpose of sending a set of gifts to another local San Franciscan arts group, Ralph Records and The Residents, and the group felt they needed an identifying moniker to do so.
Original S.F. member, artist Douglas Bert Kennedy created the first logo of the shield emblazoned with the goats head. After Steve Jones Daughs had established the Gargoyle Mechanique project and identity in New York, Kennedy redesigned the logo into the bug-like-tribal-mask image. Eventually Jones altered that design, placing it inside a gear, to create what is most widely remembered as the Gargoyle Mechanique logo image.
The initial San Francisco collective, located in an old Victorian-era house at the intersection of 14th Street and Eureka, a few blocks from Castro and Market, included sculptor/poet/illustrator Douglas Bert Kennedy, electronic music composer Matthew Myrle Crowe, experimental musician Steve Jones Daughs, poet musician David Davo Landazuri. In various collaboration with others and themselves, the group made music, sculpture and writings all at once.

Talons (song)

"Talons" is the second single released by Bloc Party from their third album, "Intimacy". It was announced on 8 September 2008 that the song would be released as a digital download to all those who had purchased the mp3 version of the band's album. The download was made available straight after the song's first play on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 9 September 2008. The song was physically released on 20 October 2008, one week prior to the album's full release. The song itself does not feature on the download-only album, but appeared on the physical release. It peaked at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. 
Talking about "Talons" on Bloc Party's official website, frontman Kele Okereke said: 
“We wanted to keep things fresh and we thought the fans would be more excited to get a new song rather than something off the album. Talons is one of the last songs we recorded during the "Intimacy" sessions and I always had it in mind to be one of the extra tracks we promised for the CD if it turned out well. It turned out great so we decided to make it the next single. I’m enjoying this way of working, not over-thinking things, just make a decision and get on with it! It’s quite liberating in a way, I’m sure it’s going to be the way things happen more and more in the future”

Robert Maurice

Robert Oza Maurice (died March 27, 2004) was a Canadian businessman and political figure. He was a candidate in several municipal elections, and led the unregistered Recreation Party of Canada in 2003. He also used the name Robert Maurice-Mayer.
Business career.
Maurice was born in Sudbury, Ontario, and left school after Grade 10. After studying in a seminary, he became a driving school instructor and franchiser of small businesses. He also wrote pamphlets on subjects such as world peace, violence against women, and the power of bureaucracy.
A 1995 article in the "Toronto Star" newspaper described him as a "confidence man" who had "left in his wake a string of bankruptcies, unpaid debts, court judgments, criminal convictions and bogus humanitarian efforts". Maurice himself did not endorse this description, though he acknowledged that his business history included "difficult times". He described himself as a "planet builder" and "original franchisor of small businesses".
2003 campaign.
Maurice became the founder and leader of the unregistered Recreation Party of Canada in 2003. The party supported the legalization of prostitution and marijuana, lower drinking ages, and a shorter work week. As party leader, Maurice ran for Mayor of Greater Sudbury in the 2003 municipal election. He acknowledged his "shadowy past", and said that he went into business in an effort to help people rather than to take their money. He was quoted as saying, "There are problems when you run businesses, and that's the price you have to pay to be a business operator under today's systems. I've been charged, I've been fined, but I've never been convicted and gone to jail." 
He ran on a platform of bringing "modern democracy and fair economics to the world". Among other things, he said that he would take money from government and bankers and give it to mathematicians, who would best be able to distribute it. He received 102 votes (0.19%), placing twelfth out of fourteen candidates.
Death.
Maurice died in 2004, at age 58. His obituary in the "Sudbury Star" newspaper indicates that he ran in several mayoral campaigns before 2003.

<doc id="19254836" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19254836" title="Hometown (TV series)">
Hometown (TV series)

Hometown is an American dramedy series than ran on CBS from August 22 to October 15, 1985. The series was a direct adaptation of the smash hit 1983 movie "The Big Chill", and centered around the same premise as the film: a group of friends all in their 30s, who had reunited after traveling separate paths following their college days in the 1960s. Upon their reunion, they found that they were even more so an integral part of each other's lives in the 1980s. Julie and Dinah Kirgo served as executive producers, with Barnet Kellman directing most of the episodes. "Hometown" was produced by Kingette Productions in association with Paramount Television.
Synopsis.
Presumably set in the same South Carolina suburb as "The Big Chill", as evidenced by the exteriors of historical 19th century landmarks around the "hometown" in the show's title sequence, "Hometown" opened with the reunion of the seven former college friends, that took place at the wedding of two of them, the longtime couple of Mary Newell (Jane Kaczmarek) and Ben Abbott (Franc Luz). Amid all the nostalgia of radical times and the reminiscing of their youth, the group found their unwaivering network of support was more important than ever, as they faced a more conservative, Reaganized America of the 1980s. Prior to the wedding, Mary and Ben had been living together for 13 years, had started a family of their own out of wedlock, and now were a modern yuppie couple raising young daughters Jennifer (Erin Leigh Peck) and Tess (Donna Vivino). Ben was a successful businessman, running a local bookstore in the city square, and Mary was on the heels of relaunching her long-abandoned dancing career.
All other series principals besides the Newell/Abbott family had now either re-established their ties with the town they all attended college in, or had remained there since college and had not seen their other friends in years. The most internationally known member of the group was Christopher Springer (Andrew Rubin), the wealthy rock star who had a troubled personal life (modeled after Bruce Springsteen). Chris decided to come back to his old hometown to regain the support from his old friends and to repair his problems, while intermittently going back on the road with his band. Completing the circle was Peter Kincaid (John Bedford Lloyd), a quirky college professor; elegant, recent divorcee Barbara Donnelly (Margaret Whitton), who currently lived off her vast settlements yet was insecure about moving on with her life and reentering the dating world; Jane Parnell (Christine Estabrook), also a college professor, but in addition serving as a Presidential advisor to the White House; and Joey Nathan (Daniel Stern), who was more disheveled and less successful than his materialistic friends. 
In the intervening years, Joey had settled into the job of a fry cook, and always proved to the gang that he was quite happy with his modest means. Joey was a single parent, raising young son Dylan (Mikey Viso), and at one point his paternity was even in question when Dylan's mother, Joey's ex-girlfriend, showed up with a DNA test. Joey's ex wanted to know who Dylan's father really was, so that if the results proved that someone else was in the picture, she could then possibly give her son a more suitable upbringing than what Joey could provide. In the ninth episode, Ben began his lobbying to run for city council, but nothing more of this development was explored, along with other plot twists, as "Hometown" was pulled from the CBS schedule permanently after that telecast.
Despite evidence that the show was set in South Carolina, "Hometown" was actually filmed in Rye, New York.
Scheduling.
In an attempt to ensure that the show would find an audience, CBS premiered "Hometown" just under a month before the official start of the 1985-86 TV season. They immediately ran it in the time slot it was slated to have on the fall schedule, Thursdays at 10/9c. However, by the time of CBS' premiere week in mid-September, the show's ratings were unsatisfactory, resulting in "Hometown" moving to Tuesdays at 8/7c as of September 24; thus, the show had already failed in its fall schedule slot before the season itself had already begun. The new night and earlier hour for "Hometown" did little to boost the ratings, so in mid-October, CBS cancelled the series. All nine completed episodes aired on the network before cancellation.

Darren Young

Fredrick "Fred" Douglas Rosser (born November 2, 1979) is an American professional wrestler, best known under his World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) ring name Darren Young. Prior to signing with WWE, Rosser competed in Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic independent promotions including Chaotic Wrestling, East Coast Wrestling Association, Independent Wrestling Federation and the National Wrestling Alliance. He is the first WWE performer to come out publicly as gay while active as a wrestler with the company.
Early life.
Rosser was born in Union, New Jersey. He began watching professional wrestling during the mid-1980s and became interested in becoming a professional wrestler as a teenager, wrestling in several backyard wrestling federations. He attended Union High School in New Jersey, where he played American football, both offensively and defensively. He attended Fairleigh Dickinson University where he played football for a year, before deciding to focus on his academic studies and professional wrestling.
Professional wrestling career.
Training and independent circuit.
Rosser became interested in becoming a professional wrestler as a teenager, wrestling in several backyard wrestling federations. He researched a number of wrestling schools before deciding on Camp IWF in West Paterson, New Jersey. This was due in part to his employer, whose uncle was a friend of a local wrestler training there at the time, and helped him enroll in the wrestling school.
Rosser made his professional debut in 2002 and spent several years on the independent circuit, including wrestling for the Independent Wrestling Federation and Chaotic Wrestling during his early career. On May 17, 2003, he won his first major title when he defeated the IWF Heavyweight Championship in Woodland Park, New Jersey and held it for over half a year until losing to Roman on January 17, 2004. It was at a house show in Chaotic Wrestling that he was first noticed by promoter Jim Kettner and invited to compete for the East Coast Wrestling Association where he made his debut in the summer of 2004. Shortly after entering the promotion, Rosser began feuding with Prince Nana over the ECWA Mid Atlantic Championship and eventually defeated him for the title in Newark, Delaware on September 18, 2004. He lost the title to Nick Malakai less than two months later.
World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE.
During 2005 and 2006, Rosser made several appearances for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on its weekly programs "Sunday Night Heat" and "Velocity" as well as in dark matches on "SmackDown" and "Raw".
Developmental territories (2009–2010).
In May 2009, Rosser signed a WWE developmental contract and was sent to WWE's developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling, under the name Darren Young. In FCW, Young was in a tag team called The South Beach Party Boys with Percy Watson. On February 16, 2010, it was announced that he would compete as part of the first season of "WWE NXT", mentored by CM Punk.
NXT and The Nexus (2010).
On February 23, 2010, Young made his debut on "WWE NXT" with a character described as a "South Beach Party Boy", losing his debut match to David Otunga. His storyline had mentor CM Punk showing apathy towards him, claiming he had no idea why he's in "NXT" and did not want to train Young unless he accepted his Straight-edge lifestyle. Despite this, Punk and his disciples, Luke Gallows and Serena, helped Young win his rematch against Otunga the following week. Young was ranked eight in the first Pros' Poll. After the pros' poll, Young decided to join the Straight Edge Society in an attempt to improve, only to change his mind before getting his hair shaved off. CM Punk decided to forgive him for standing up to him when he defeated Luke Gallows with Young's own hair on the line. Because of this victory, CM Punk had then been interested in Young's potential, but in turn started feuding with a jealous Luke Gallows. On May 11 in the second Pros poll, Young was ranked fifth out of the six remaining contestants and narrowly escaped elimination. The following week, however, Young was eliminated from the competition.
The week following the Season 1 finale, Young, along with the other season one "NXT" rookies turned heel and interfered in the main event match on "Raw" between John Cena and Young's former Pro, CM Punk, and attacked both wrestlers, the announce team, and the ring announcer Justin Roberts, before they dismantled the ring area and surrounding equipment. On the June 14 edition of "Raw" the rookies attacked General Manager Bret Hart, when he refused to give them contracts. The following week on "Raw", Vince McMahon fired Hart and announced that a new General Manager had been hired, one that had signed all seven season one NXT rookies to contracts. The following week, the group was named The Nexus. On the July 5 episode of "Raw", The Nexus tried to attack John Cena as he confronted Wade Barrett during their "truce" with one another. The segment ended with The Nexus leaving without Young, when other Raw wrestlers arrived to aid Cena, and Young was assaulted by Cena to end the show. Due to Cena's actions, the new general manager pitted Cena in a 7 on 1 handicap match against The Nexus scheduled for the following week. Young however did not participate in the handicap match due to injuries caused by Cena the previous week, though The Nexus was successful in winning the match. He returned on July 18 at Money in the Bank with the rest of The Nexus, sporting a new haircut and costing Cena the WWE Championship against Sheamus. After the match, Cena attacked Young and fellow Nexus teammate, Michael Tarver. The Nexus continued to feud with Cena and the Raw roster, resulting in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match at SummerSlam. Young was the first person to be eliminated from the match, when he submitted to Daniel Bryan in under a minute, and The Nexus went on to lose the match. On the next episode of "Raw" the members of The Nexus fought in individual matches against members of the victorious Team WWE with the stipulation that losing a match would have them exiled from the group. Young chose to face John Cena but failed to win, and was exiled and attacked as a result.
Singles competition (2010–2011).
Young returned on the September 6 episode of "Raw", distracting Barrett and costing him a match against Randy Orton thus turned Young face. On the October 4 episode of "Raw", Young participated in a battle royal to determine the number one contender to the WWE Championship, but was eliminated by The Nexus. Young had his first singles match since leaving The Nexus on the October 7 episode of "Superstars", but lost to William Regal. Young had his first win in singles competition on the October 14 airing of "Superstars" defeating Primo. Young team up with Tatsu in a losing effort against The Usos in mid November in two occasions.Young got his first victory of 2011 when he teamed with Primo, Yoshi Tatsu, and David Hart Smith to defeat Zack Ryder, William Regal, and The Usos on the January 13 episode of "Superstars".
Return to NXT (2011–2012).
In March 2011, Young was selected as one of six former "NXT" contestants to return to the show in its fifth season, "NXT Redemption". During this season, Young was mentored by Chavo Guerrero. In the season premiere, Young defeated Jacob Novak and won the first challenge to earn himself "redemption points". On the April 12 episode of "NXT", Young attacked Titus O'Neil after their match and tried to attack O'Neil's pro Hornswoggle, but was stopped by Guerrero. He turned heel, when he attacked Hornswoggle, and later he and Guerrero faced O'Neil and different tag team partners on several occasions. On the April 19 edition of Redemption, Young faced Hornswoggle in single match. During their match, Chavo Guerrero gave Young a blindfold but In the end Hornswoggle wins after a Tadpole splash. On the May 3 edition of Redemption, Young lost to his Pros Chavo Guerrero with Hornswoggle as a special guest referee. On the May 10 edition of Redemption, Hornswoggle didn't appear on NXT and accused by Hornswoggle Rookie's Titus O'Neil. The following week, It was revealed Chavo Guerrero kidnapped Hornswoggle and hid Hornswoggle in the box. Then, Guerrero and Young was attack Hornswoggle in the ring until O'Neil made a save. The feud was settled when Titus O'Neil and Darren Young faced each other in a No Disqualitication Match on the May 24 episode of NXT Redemption. The match ended with Titus O'Neil a victor after Hornswoggle interfered in a match which O'Neil attack Guerrero and Young. Guerrero was later released from WWE, leaving Young on his own. In August he formed an alliance with Derrick Bateman and the duo teamed up against O'Neil and "NXT" host Matt Striker, but were defeated. Young then moved into a feud with Striker, defeating him on two consecutive occasions. After Young attacked Striker following a handshake, William Regal intervened, saving Striker. Two weeks later, Young was defeated by Regal in a singles match. Young then formed an alliance with JTG and defeated Striker and O'Neil. After the match they were attacked by the Usos.
Young was suspended for 30 days on October 5, 2011. Following his suspension, Young returned on the November 16, 2011 episode of "NXT" and assaulted Titus O'Neil. Young was then able to get the better of O'Neil twice in tag team matches. The conclusion to Young's feud with O'Neil came when O'Neil defeated Young in a no disqualifications match. O'Neil then turned heel and formed an alliance with Young. Young and O'Neil feuded with Percy Watson and Alex Riley in February 2012, defeating them twice. In March, while he and O'Neil were feuding with the Usos, Young started chasing the affections of Tamina.
The Prime Time Players (2012–2014).
On the April 18 episode of "NXT", Young and O'Neil were signed by John Laurinaitis to the SmackDown brand. The team made their debut for the brand on the April 20 episode of "SmackDown" with a victory over The Usos. The team suffered their first team loss against the WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth on the May 18 edition of Smackdown.

On the July 16 episode of "Raw", Young and O'Neil unsuccessfully challenged Kofi Kingston and R-Truth for the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the August 10 episode of "SmackDown", they defeated Primo and Epico in a number one contenders match via disqualification when A.W. provoked Kingston and R-Truth, who were on commentary, into interfering in the match. That same day, A. W. was released from his contract. Prime Time Players received their title shots at SummerSlam, but were again defeated by Kingston and R-Truth. On the September 7 edition of "Smackdown", Prime Time Players defeated Primo and Epico and The Usos in a triple threat tag team match to earn another shot the Tag Team Championship. However, on "Raw" three days later, Prime Time Players lost their title shot to the team of Daniel Bryan and Kane (soon to be known as Team Hell No). At the Survivor Series pay-per-view, Young took part in a 10 man elimination tag team match, but was eliminated by Rey Mysterio.
Young also competed in the 2013 Royal Rumble entering at entrant 15 but was eliminated by Kofi Kingston.
On the August 19, 2013 edition of "Raw", the Prime Time Players turned face in a winning effort against the Real Americans. The face turn had been speculated about for some months, especially after Young's real-life coming out the previous week which received mainstream media coverage.
The team gained a push, challenging for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but lost a match to The Shield. The duo also sided with other face wrestlers from the active roster, only to get punished by COO Triple H for preventing Daniel Bryan from being critically injured by Randy Orton. The Prime Time Players were amongst the select few ordered to battle The Shield in separately sanctioned 3 on 1 handicap matches on the September 20 edition of "SmackDown", as punishment for their intervention.
Return to singles competition (2014-present).
On the January 31, 2014 episode of "SmackDown" after Young was pinned in a tag team match against Ryback and Curtis Axel, O'Neil attacked him after the match, turning heel and officially disbanding the team. On Smackdown the same week, Darren attacked Titus to get redemption and for Titus calling Darren "Dead Weight". Young picked up a victory over Damien Sandow on the February 14 edition of SmackDown, before being attacked by Titus O'Neil, which turned into a brawl and left O'Neil in tattered clothes. They went one on one at the 2014 Elimination Chamber, with the victor being O'Neil. However, Young defeated O'Neil in a rematch on "Main Event".
Personal life.
Rosser has cited Shawn Michaels and Ricky Steamboat as his favorite wrestlers. In an interview released on August 15, 2013, he publicly discussed being gay. While WWE Hall of Famer and current WWE creative consultant Pat Patterson and former WWE wrestlers Chris Kanyon & Orlando Jordan both came out as either gay or (in Jordan's case) bisexual after either leaving the company or (in Patterson's case) retiring, Young is the first wrestler ever to come out while still signed to a major promotion. Later that day, WWE released a statement in support of Rosser for being open about his sexuality, and various fellow wrestlers (including John Cena who has a brother who is also gay) tweeted their support for him. He also discussed his childhood stuttering issues. Rosser has been in a relationship with his partner, Nick, for two years. Rosser is a sports fan and a fan of English League One team Leyton Orient F.C. and always visits when in the U.K.

After training as a lawyer he was called to the Common Bench as a Serjeant-at-law in 1311, being made a King's Serjeant in 1315 and a justice of the Common Bench on 16 October 1320. He held this position until 1329, other than a period as a justice for the King's Bench between July 1323 and 4 May 1324; in 1324 he was also knighted. On 22 February 1329 he was made Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas on 3 September. He was removed from this position on 2 March 1331, however, possibly due to Edward III, who replaced important officers after he was crowned; there is, however, no evidence that Stonor was politically active.
He was reappointed as Chief Justice on 7 July 1335, but removed on 30 November 1341 after another purge of the administration. He was reappointed yet again on 9 May 1342, making him one of only two Chief Justices to be appointed on three separate occasions. Stonor continued to serve as Chief Justice from 1342 until 22 February 1354, where he left due to weakness, dying the same year. Although most of his time as a justice was at Westminster, he also served in York between 1327–1329 and 1334–1336. Other work included special inquiries into the disorders in 1327 at Bury St Edmunds and Abingdon Abbey and in 1335 at Oxford, official misconduct in 1323 and 1331–1334 and trying rebels in 1323, 1327, and 1331. He was also involved in overseas commissions, including reviewing the trial of Otto Grandson for misadministering Channel Islands in 1319 and diplomatic work in France in 1324 and Spain in 1325.

My Dad, John McCain

My Dad, John McCain is an illustrated children's book based on the life of John McCain. Written by his daughter, Meghan McCain, and published through Aladdin Paperbacks, it was released on September 2, 2008. The book's images were illustrated by Dan Andreasen. The book was intended to support John McCain's candidacy for President of the United States in 2008.
Book.
The book focuses on John McCain's United States military service and his presidential run. Although the book is aimed at children, it deals with John McCain's capture and imprisonment as a prisoner of war for five and a half years during the Vietnam War, and even depicts risqué scenes of John McCain being poked with hot iron prods as well as a man being stabbed repeatedly with a small knife by a Vietcong insurgent. For its initial pressing, over 200,000 copies were printed. The book has been described as "less a children's book than one written for wide-eyed adults with very nice drawings."

List of Mario educational games

The popularity of the "Super Mario" series led to the release of several spin-off "Mario" educational games from 1988 to 1996. Nintendo had little involvement in the development of these games; they were created by various other developers, including The Software Toolworks and Interplay Entertainment. Some of the titles were released exclusively for either the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the Super NES, or for personal computers, while others were released on two or more of those platforms. The "Mario" educational games were generally designed for use by children in preschool or kindergarten and focused on developing skills ranging from language and typing to geography and history. The educational games were not well-received, with many critics and gamers labeling them as some of the worst "Mario" games ever made. 
Mario Discovery Series.
The "Mario Discovery Series" is a label given to five "Mario" educational games that were developed by The Software Toolworks.
"Mario Is Missing!".
"Mario Is Missing!" is the first "Mario" game to feature only Luigi as the starring character, which did not occur again until "Luigi's Mansion" in 2001.
Plot.
Bowser sets up a castle in Antarctica, and plans to use many hair dryers from Hafta Havit, a mail order company, to melt Antarctica's ice and flood Earth. He sends Koopas to cities across Earth to steal artifacts to fund his operation. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi travel to Bowser's castle to stop him. Luigi is hesitant to go in, so Mario goes by himself and is kidnapped by Bowser, prompting Luigi to rescue him. This plot is not explicitly included in the Super Nintendo version.
Gameplay.
Luigi progresses through the game by completing levels in Bowser's castle; each floor is guarded by one Koopaling and contains a number of pipes which transport Luigi to a city containing Koopas. Once a floor is completed, Luigi must defeat the Koopaling guarding that floor to proceed to the next.
The main gameplay consists of moving around a city in side-scrolling manner while jumping on Koopas to collect stolen artifacts (pieces of famous landmarks). Luigi then must "secure" the city by taking these artifacts to their respective locations and correctly answering two questions about the landmark. Once an artifact is returned, the landmark is reopened. During the quest to return all three artifacts to their proper landmarks, Luigi must determine his location to receive the assistance of Yoshi by using a device called the Globulator. If Luigi takes Yoshi to the correct location, he can ride him for double the walking and running speed. Once the exit pipe is found, Luigi is returned to the castle as long as he has Yoshi with him to scare the Pokey into the pipe; otherwise he will be unable to return to the castle. He can then proceed to another town to do it again.
In each city, Luigi is able to question the locals to gain clues as to his current location, the general direction of remaining Koopas, and information about the affected landmarks. He is given a map showing where information booths, people and Koopas are in the city. After returning the artifacts to the locations, Luigi takes photographs of the places he visits, which can be viewed any time later in the game. 
The game has a difficulty level ranging from preschool all the way up to "adult" (i.e. college) difficulty.
"Mario's Early Years!" games.
The "Mario's Early Years! games were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The three games were Mario's Early Years! Fun with Letters; Mario's Early Years! Fun with Numbers; and Mario's Early Years! Preschool Fun (known in the United Kingdom as Mario's Playschool"). The games were released in September, October, and November 1994, respectively, and all support the SNES Mouse peripheral. The games contain Mario, Princess Peach and Yoshi on a wooden boat traveling from island to island, learning about various subjects. All three games use the same game engine.
"Fun with Numbers" and "Fun with Letters" were both directed by Andy Iverson and Henrik Markarian, and "Preschool Fun" was directed by Peter Lipson. While the games feature some remixes of "Super Mario World" music, original music was composed by Rob Wallace and Sam Powell.
"Nintendo Power" awarded "Fun with Letters" a score of 2.95 out of 5 and "Preschool Fun" a score of 2.725 out of 5.
"Mario Teaches Typing" games.
Mario Teaches Typing was released on personal computers and was designed to teach typing skills to children. The game was developed by Interplay and published by Nintendo. It was first released for MS-DOS in 1991 and then for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh in 1995. Mario is voiced by Ronald B. Ruben in the floppy disk version and by Charles Martinet in the CD-ROM version. A sequel, Mario Teaches Typing 2, was developed by Interplay and published by Nintendo in 1996. Mario is voiced only by Martinet in the sequel.
Gameplay.
"Mario Teaches Typing" includes three selectable characters: Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach. The game displays two pairs of hands which show which finger to use; for example, if the player has to type "A", the leftmost finger is highlighted. If the player makes an error, the cursor does not advance until they enter the correct key. After time ends, the exercise ends and a chalkboard screen appears, displaying statistics on how well the player performed, including words per minute. "Mario Teaches Typing 2" adds additional gameplay features, including a customizable certificate of achievement, color-coded on-screen keyboard, customizable lesson plans, and the infamous Mario head.
Unlike the first game, "Mario Teaches Typing 2" features a story in which Mario and Luigi encounter a magical typewriter. After Mario incorrectly types a phrase that would destroy Bowser's castle, the typewriter explodes into three pieces. The pieces of the typewriter are retrieved as the player progresses through the game lessons; when the typewriter is fully repaired Mario is able to type the phrase correctly, resulting in the destruction of Bowser's castle.
"Super Mario Bros. & Friends: When I Grow Up".
Super Mario Bros. & Friends: When I Grow Up is a children's computer coloring game, featuring Mario and Luigi, released in 1991 for the PC. Players can paint Mario and other Nintendo characters.

Lake Humboldt

Lake Humboldt or Humboldt Lake is an endorheic basin lake in northern Churchill County and southern Pershing County in the state of Nevada in the United States.
The lake receives the Humboldt River from the north but has no outlet. Humboldt Sink, an intermittent extension of the lake to the south, crosses into northern Churchill County. Since the lake is fed by a freshwater source but has no outlet, its water varies between brackish and extremely salt-laden depending on its distance from the inlet.

Galactic Command

Galactic Command (GALCOM for short) is the third series of space exploration video games developed by 3000AD, Inc.
Unlike the previous series, this game is targeted specifically for the casual/action fan, with advertised 'very low learning curve'. Elements such as trading, diplomacy, pointless exploration from the previous series were stripped away for the AIP (Acquire, Identify, Prosecute) compliant gameplay experience.
Missions include recon, search & destroy, combat air patrol, escort, tactical support and other variants.
Galactic Command - Echo Squad.
On February 6, 2007, Turner Broadcasting, the owner of Gametap who licenses several of Smart's back catalog of titles, announced at the D.I.C.E summit that it had signed an exclusive agreement with Smart to bring the first Galactic Command title, Echo Squad, exclusively to its Gametap subscription service in the Spring as an original episodic series. Gametap did not release the game to their subscribers as originally planned and, according to Gamasutra, cancelled their publishing deal. In discussing the deal's cancellation Rick Sanchez, GameTap VP of Content said ""I think it’s one of the strongest games ever made"" but that ""We could put a lot of promos behind it, but it wouldn't resonate too strongly with our audience""
The published game would have been sold as 4 separate episodes, with 16 missions for each episode.
Game map includes galaxy with 8 star systems, approximately 50 planets and moons with several containing populated areas. There are over 50 space crafts.
Development.
In 2006-12, Smart announced Galactic Command, a new franchise title.
Galactic Command - Echo Squad Second Edition.
Following the cancellation of the original Echo Squad, the cancelled game was released commercially in Second Edition. Although episodic had originally be planned from the first edition, the distribution only began in this edition.
The game includes voice narrated in-game tutorial. It also advertised support of wide screen resolutions.
Episodes.
The full game includes Episode 1, with additional games sold separately. Upon completing a campaign, freeform gameplay mode is unlocked.
Galactic Command - Talon Elite.
It is the company's first game for consoles, based on the Echo Squad Second Edition, with unique features and scenarios.
Development.
On 2007-05-16, 3000AD announced Galactic Command — Talon Elite., the second title in the new series. In a statement on 17 December, Smart set a release date of the late 2008 for the XBox 360, with the PC version coming thereafter.
Galactic Command - KnightBlade.
It is an announced title for the series. It also followed the episodic formula in Echo Squad.
Development.
The game was originally called "KnightBlade – Final Flight" (also called "KnightBlade - Line Of Defense", "Galactic Command - Excalibur"), a title originally announced in 2004. This game was originally started as a project for the Xbox, but was eventually put into production for the more powerful Xbox 360 game system. The original game had a release date of 2005 Q3 when it was pushed back.
On 2006-01-25, 3000AD announced "KnightBlade - Line Of Defense" for Xbox 360, with projected release in Q1 of 2008. However, the project was delayed to 2010.
Galactic Command - Bravo Team.
It is an announced first person shooter title based on the adventures of a team of elite marines assigned to a planetary starbase. It is also sold in episodic format.
Player can choose between Mobile Infantry Marine or Elite Force Marine career.
Development.
On 2007-03-19, 3000AD announced Galactic Command — Bravo Team, an episodic first-person shooter title. The title is currently scheduled for release in 2009.
Galactic Command Online.
Originally titled "Universal Combat Online", it is a massive multiplayer online game. The new name was used when the developer decided it had sufficiently large update over Universal Combat.
The game remains combat focused and trading is restricted to the Trader caste only. However, with access to a starbase or starstation, player's ship is repaired and rearmed for free.
When driving space craft, player cannot move around within the ship. However, full first person perspective is available for all characters. First person HUD has been re-designed with a less cluttered and minimalist approach, which could be seen in the Bravo Team game.
Player can choose all the careers paths in the previous Battlecruiser and Universal Combat series, which include Commander, Elite Force Pilot, Planetary Support Pilot, Elite Force Marine, Mobile Infantry Marine, Assault Force Marine, Recon Force Marine, Space Force Marine, Engineering Corps Marine, Medical Corps Marine. However, player is restricted to 1 career per profile. To be a Commander, Player starts career as Elite Force Pilot, and earns Experience Points by competing against rival player or NPC units. Commander's assigned task is based on player's caste, which also affects Commander's starting space craft. Career types also affects the type of space craft available to player.
Development.
The game was originally announced in 2000 as one of the final games in the Battlecruiser series, along with Battlecruiser Millennium. GCO had the original release date of Q3 2001. In January 2011, the company confirmed that they were still working on the title.
Reception.
Reviews were mixed, praising the game for its ambition and scope but critical of the complex nonstandard user interface which is not customisable, elements of the design, and the steep learning curve. GameRankings listed an aggregate review score of 56%.
Smart has commented that he would refund gamers who purchased "Galactic Command" ahead of its release and weren’t satisfied with his product [http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/03/10/pc-game-maker-offering-money-back-guarantee-for-any-haters/][http://bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&threadid=85844].

Charleston High School (West Virginia)

Charleston High School is a former high school, which was closed in 1989, in Kanawha County, West Virginia. Its final location is where CAMC General Hospital is now located in downtown Charleston, West Virginia. In 1989, Charleston High School and Stonewall Jackson High School consolidated to form Capital High School.
History.
1818-1915.
There were three Mercer Schools. Mercer Academy was built in 1818 on Quarrier and Hale Streets. The second Mercer School, constructed in 1888, was on the site of where the last Charleston High building was built. This building was used as a high school from 1888 to 1890, and then as a grade school from 1890 to 1903. The date of demolition is unknown. The Third Mercer school was built on Quarrier Street in 1903.
From 1876 to 1890, Union School was the first location which housed Kanawha County High School. With one principal, two teachers, and about 25 students, the first graduating class consisted of two women. Union School again temporarily housed Kanawha County High School in 1903. Kanawha County High School became Charleston High School a year later.
Charleston High School was moved from its first location at Union School to the third Mercer School. This was the first building constructed for the purpose of housing Charleston High School, on Quarrier Street, in 1904. In 1890, the high school was moved to the Mercer School building on Washington Street East and this building then housed Central Junior High School, Mercer Grade School, and the Board of Education. In 1970 it became a parking lot.
1916-1989.
The building for Charleston High School was opened in 1916 and was located on the corner of Quarrier Street and Morris Street in downtown Charleston. It later became Thomas Jefferson Junior High School when the new building for Charleston High School was built on the boundary streets of Washington Street East, Brooks Street, and Lee Street. The new building was only three blocks from the original building.
The new building was built in 1926, due to over-crowding in previous buildings. It was called, "the big school." Even "the big school" became over-crowded during the late 30's, so Stonewall Jackson High School was built in 1940, to accommodate the students on the west side of Charleston.
As baby boom years continued, the need arose for another high school. In 1965, George Washington High School was built, to accommodate the students in South Hills and Loudendale. 
During the 80's, the student populations at CHS and SJHS dropped. In 1989 Capital High School opened, combining the students of these two former rival schools. This ended a 49 year rivalry.
Charleston High School was torn down in mid 1989. Stonewall Jackson High School became a junior high school.
During Charleston High's time, the school participated in the Daily Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival. The school won the festival grand championship once in 1979 and has had seven majorettes named Miss Kanawha Majorette.

Regulation and monitoring of pollution

To protect the environment from the adverse effects of pollution, many nations worldwide have enacted legislation to regulate various types of pollution as well as to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution.
Regulation and monitoring by region.
International.
Since pollution crosses political boundaries international treaties have been made through the United Nations and its agencies to address international pollution issues.
Greenhouse gas emissions.
The Kyoto Protocol is an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international treaty on global warming. It also reaffirms sections of the UNFCCC. Countries which ratify this protocol commit to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. A total of 141 countries have ratified the agreement. Notable exceptions include the United States and Australia, who have signed but not ratified the agreement. The stated reason for the United States not ratifying is the exemption of large emitters of greenhouse gases who are also developing countries, like China and India.
An UN environmental conference held in Bali 3–14 December 2007 with the participation from 180 countries aims to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which will end in 2012. During the first day of the conference USA, Saudi Arabia and Canada were presented with the "Fossil-of-the-day-award", a symbolic bag of coal for their negative impact on the global climate. The bags included the flags of the respective countries.
Also another protocol named the earth summit was enacted by WHO(World Health Organization)on 1921 to check global warming and also to reduce the emissions of the greenhouse gases.
Canada.
In Canada the regulation of pollution and its effects are monitored by a number of organizations depending on the nature of the pollution and its location. The three levels of government (Federal – Canada Wide; Provincial; and Municipal) equally share in the responsibilities, and in the monitoring and correction of pollution.
China.
China's rapid industrialization has substantially increased pollution. China has some relevant regulations: the 1979 Environmental Protection Law, which was largely modeled on U.S. legislation, but the environment continues to deteriorate. Twelve years after the law, only one Chinese city was making an effort to clean up its water discharges. This indicates that China is about 30 years behind the U.S. schedule of environmental regulation and 10 to 20 years behind Europe. In July 2007, it was reported that the World Bank reluctantly censored a report revealing that 750,000 people in China die every year as a result of pollution-related diseases. China's State Environment Protection Agency and the Health Ministry asked the World Bank to cut the calculations of premature deaths from the report fearing the revelation would provoke "social unrest".
Europe.
The basic European rules are included in the Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) and the National Emission Ceilings Directive.
United Kingdom.
In the 1840s, the United Kingdom brought onto the statute books legislation to control water pollution. It was extended to all rivers and coastal water by 1961. However, currently the clean up of historic contamination is controlled under a specific statutory scheme found in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Part IIA), as inserted by the Environment Act 1995, and other ‘rules’ found in regulations and statutory guidance. The Act came into force in England in April 2000.
Within the current regulatory framework, Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) is a regime for controlling pollution from certain industrial activities. The regime introduces the concept of Best Available Techniques ("BAT") to environmental regulations. Operators must use the BAT to control pollution from their industrial activities to prevent, and where that is not practicable, to reduce to acceptable levels, pollution to air, land and water from industrial activities. The Best Available Techniques also aim to balance the cost to the operator against benefits to the environment.
The system of Pollution Prevention and Control is replacing that of Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) (which was established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990) and is taking effect between 2000 and 2007. The Pollution Prevention and Control regime implements the European Directive (EC/96/61) on integrated pollution prevention and control.
United States.
The United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1963 to legislate the reduction of smog and atmospheric pollution in general. That legislation has subsequently been amended and extended in 1966, 1970, 1977 and 1990. Numerous state and local governments have enacted similar legislation either implementing or filling in locally important gaps in the national program. The national Clean Air Act and similar state legislative acts have led to the widespread use of atmospheric dispersion modeling in order to analyze the air quality impacts of proposed major actions. With the 1990 Clean Air Act, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began a controversial carbon trading system in which tradable rights to emit a specified level of carbon are granted to polluters.
Enactment of the 1972 Clean Water Act required facilities to obtain permits for discharges to navigable waters and establishment of national discharge standards for municipal sewage treatment plants and many industrial categories. It required use of best management practices for a wide range of other water discharges including nonpoint source pollution. Amendments in 1977 required stricter regulation of toxic pollutants. In 1987 Congress added permit coverage for municipal and industrial stormwater discharges.
Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 1976, which created a regulatory framework for both municipal solid waste and hazardous waste disposed on land. RCRA requires that all hazardous wastes be managed and tracked from generation of the waste, through transport and processing, to final disposal, by means of a nationwide permit system. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 mandated regulation of underground storage tanks containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals, and the phasing out of land disposal of hazardous waste. The Federal Facilities Compliance Act, passed in 1992, clarified RCRA coverage of federally owned properties such as military bases. Illegal disposal of waste is punishable by fines of up to $25,000 per occurrence.
Passage of the Noise Control Act in 1972 established mechanisms of setting emission standards for virtually every source of noise including motor vehicles, aircraft, certain types of HVAC equipment and major appliances. It also put local government on notice as to their responsibilities in land use planning to address noise mitigation. This noise regulation framework comprised a broad data base detailing the extent of noise health effects. Congress ended funding of the federal noise control program in 1981, which curtailed development of further national regulations.
The state of California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has maintained an independent list of substances with product labeling requirements as part of Proposition 65 since 1986.

Ixemul.library

The ixemul.library is a software source-code compatibility library for Amiga. It allows software for Unix-like platforms to be easily compiled on Amiga systems with minimal source code modification.
Description.
The ixemul.library is a BSD 4.3 Unix kernel running under the Amiga OS where the system API calls are then internally converted to native Amiga kernel calls. The API is specifically modeled against NetBSD, providing a similar system for process control, multitasking, file operations, signals, pipes and other messaging methods. The library provides this with low overhead, requiring roughly 200KB of memory.
Because the library resembles BSD Unix very closely most Unix-like programs can be compiled without modification (see "limitations" below). Programs that require BSD Sockets networking can use the related ixnet.library. Programs that include X Window client support can use the Amiga port of X.
There is no general restriction against using both ixemul and Amiga native API calls simultaneously. However, using ixemul calls simultaneously with Amiga native API calls can cause problems.
History.
The library was originally developed around 1991-92 by Markus Wild as an aid in porting the GNU Compiler Collection and PDKsh. Several incomplete source snapshots were made available online while he continued to release new binaries. When Markus shifted his attention to NetBSD development full time, development of the library stalled.
Around 1994, Rafael W. Luebbert produced a fork of the project, gluing together different working parts of the public source code. This version soon became the "de facto" standard within the Amiga community.
A second fork of the project was later started by Leonard Norrgard. Due to overlapping version numbers, this resulted in some ambiguity between projects. The projects were later merged under a single maintainer, which is its current state.
MorphOS has adopted ixemul.library as part of its system libraries.
Limitations.
The library does not emulate the BSD system API in its entirety. Some of the signals, such as SIGSTOP, are missing. The use of some process control functions, such as fork(), cannot be fully implemented due to the Amiga's lightweight, non-virtual memory system; instead, more lightweight versions, such as vfork(), are utilized.
The library does not claim POSIX compliance.
The library does not act as emulator for BSD system calls when using pre-compiled binaries from other operating systems. Binaries from NetBSD/m68k and SunOS/m68k remain incompatible.

Tobu 8000 series

The is a commuter electric multiple unit (EMU) train type operated by the private railway operator Tobu Railway in Japan since 1963.
A total of 712 vehicles were built between 1963 and 1983, making this the most numerous EMU type operated by any private railway operator in Japan.
Operations.
Isesaki Line.
The Isesaki Line fleet consists of 2-, 4-, and 6-car trainsets based at Kasukabe, Tatebayashi, and Shin-Tochigi depots. A fleet of 3-car 800 and 850 series trains converted from 8000 series units is also based at Tatebayashi Depot.
Kameido Line.
The Kameido Line uses 2-car trainsets modified for driver-only operation.
Kiryu Line.
Kiryu Line services include 800 and 850 series 3-car driver-only-operation sets introduced from the start of the revised timetable on 18 March 2006.
Noda Line.
The Noda Line fleet based at Nanakōdai Depot consists of 2-, 4-, and 6-car trainsets.
Sano Line.
Sano Line services include 800 and 850 series 3-car driver-only-operation sets introduced from the start of the revised timetable on 18 March 2006.
Tojo Line.
The Tōjō Line fleet based at Shinrinkōen Depot consists of 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-car trainsets. These are operated as 10-car formations for services to/from Ikebukuro and as 4-car formations for local driver-only-operation services north of Ogawamachi.
Ogose Line.
From the start of the revised timetable on 14 June 2008, only refurbished 4-car driver-only-operation sets are used on the Ogose Line.
History.
Production.
The first 8000 series appeared in November 1963 as 4-car sets. These were joined from December 1964 by 2-car sets (formed MoHa8500 + KuHa8600). Between 1971 and 1972, 14 pairs of additional intermediate cars (SaHa8700 + MoHa8800) were built and inserted into 4-car sets 8101 to 8114 to lengthen them to six cars. 8000 series trains built up to this point were not equipped with air-conditioning, but from June 1972, three 6-car air-conditioned sets (8156 to 8158) were delivered. The originally non-fitted sets were also modified with air-conditioning from October 1973 until 1983 at the Alna Kōki (now Alna Sharyō) factory in Osaka and Tsuha Sharyō factory in Nishiarai, Tokyo.
In May 1977, the first 8-car 8000 series set (8173) was delivered for use on the Tojo Line.
October 1979 saw the last two digits of individual car running numbers exceed 99, resulting in some cars receiving 5-digit (8xxxx) running numbers.
The last two sets built, 81120 and 8580, were delivered in 1983.
The fleet changes between 1963, when the first sets were built, and 1983, when construction ended, are shown below.
The fleet changes from 2005, when withdrawals commenced, are shown below. (Including 800/850 series 3-car sets)
Refurbishment.
Life-extension refurbishment began in 1986, and sets treated from 1987 received redesigned cab ends based on the 6050 series design. Sets refurbished from 1997 onward received HID headlights and LED external destination indicators, replacing the original roller blind type.
2001 saw the first appearance of 2-car sets modified for driver-only-operation. This included the addition of an automated bilingual (Japanese and English) passenger announcement system, internal LED passenger information displays, and external speakers.
Some of the remaining unrefurbished sets also received LED destination indicators.
800 and 850 series conversion.
From 2004, five 8-car sets were reformed to create pairs of 3-car 800 and 850 series driver-only-operation sets for use on Sano and Kiryū Line services. This conversion involved adding new cabs to former MoHa8300 and MoHa8200 intermediate cars.
The new sets are formed as follows.
Livery changes.
When first built, the 8000 series sets were finished in a livery of "royal beige" and "international orange". From May 1974, sets were repainted into a simpler all-over livery of "sage cream". From 1985, sets were repainted into a new livery of "jasmine white" with dark and light blue bodyside stripes. As of 2008, all 8000 series sets operate in this livery.
One 6-car set (8108) was repainted into the original beige and orange livery between October 2004 and June 2005 to mark the 90th anniversary of the Tōjō Line. This unit was subsequently returned to standard livery following overhaul in July 2005.
In August 2012, 6-car set 8111, preserved in running order by the Tobu Museum, was repainted into its original "royal beige" and "international orange" livery for a series of special event runs.

Land-based game fishing

Land-based game fishing is a form of sport fishing in which anglers attempt to catch big-game fish from shore rather than from ocean-going boats. The locations for such activities are generally rock platforms, though wharfs, jetties and beaches are also common. Some species such as sharks can be targeted in shallow water, however most other species prefer deep water, and this limits the areas where these types can be fished in this way. Tackle used is usually comparable to that used for these species from boats, but some differences are necessary, such as changes in rod length. Different tackle is used according to location and species targeted.
The billfish (marlin and sailfish) and the larger tuna (bluefin, yellowfin) are the main target species; smaller game fish are also sought, such as Spanish mackerel, dolphinfish, wahoo, smaller tuna species such as albacore and skipjack tuna, Australian longtail. Land–based shark fishing has had some popularity since the early 1900s. Some of the more sought species include large tiger sharks and hammerhead sharks, with sizes exceeding 500 lbs. Many land–based shark fishermen use catch and release techniques to return sharks to the water after capture.
Locations.
The best land–based game fishing is at present restricted to very few areas around the world. The best–known spots are in South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and the Andaman Islands, of which Barren Island and Narcondum volcano have produced marlin from the rocks.
Along the east coast of Australia, land based game fishing can be divided into two fairly distinct geographic regions. On the north coast of New South Wales, from approximately Sydney north, light tackle is generally used, with smaller target species such as longtail tuna, Spanish mackerel and cobia. Particularly noted are the rock platforms of Jervis Bay, where black marlin of up to have been caught using bait floated out on balloons. South of Sydney, heavier tackle is used as the target species are generally much larger, with the main targets being black marlin, yellowfin tuna, kingfish and sharks.

Tone (Jeff Ament album)

Tone is the debut solo album of American rock bassist and Pearl Jam-member Jeff Ament, released September 16, 2008 on Monkeywrench Records. 3,000 copies of the album were pressed and distributed through independent record stores across the United States, as well as through Pearl Jam's official website. The album has also been made available as a digital download via Pearl Jam's official website for US$4.99.
Background.
The album contains ten songs written over a span of 12 years. It features a raw, experimental sound and was recorded by Ament over an eight-year period at Horseback Court in Blue Mountain, Montana, which is Ament's home studio, and completed in 2008. "Tone" was mixed by Brett Eliason, who had previously worked with Ament as Pearl Jam's sound engineer. Its cover art was created by Ament.
Former Three Fish drummer and frequent Ament collaborator Richard Stuverud contributed his drumming to seven songs on the album, and King's X frontman Doug Pinnick contributed lead vocals to the song "Doubting Thomasina". Pinnick would later in 2010 feature as the lead singer of another Ament/Stuverud project, "Tres Mts". "The Forest" was recorded by Pearl Jam; however, vocalist Eddie Vedder never got around to adding vocals to the track. The instrumental version by Pearl Jam is featured in the 2007 Pearl Jam concert film, "Immagine in Cornice". The version of the song on "Tone" features vocals by Ament and music taken from the original demo version of the song.

Battle Creek, Utah

The first battle between Mormon settlers in Utah and the Native American Ute Indians who lived there occurred at Battle Creek, Utah. The sleeping Indians were outnumbered and outgunned so that they did not stand a chance against the Deseret Militia who crept in and surrounded their camp in the pre-dawn hours of March 5, 1849. Mormon settlement of Utah Valley came upon the heels of the attack at Battle Creek, Utah.
What Happened at Battle Creek?
At Battle Creek, now called Pleasant Grove, Utah, not long before the first Mormon settlers arrived in Utah Valley, a group of Timpanogots Indians was attacked in a pre-dawn maneuver by Mormon Militiamen. The Company of LDS men were called from Salt Lake City on March 1, 1849, to “go to the Utah Valley against some Indians who had been stealing a lot of horses from Brigham's herd.” They were under orders “to take such measures as would put a final end to their (Indian) depredations in future.” They camped in the snow the first night near Little Cottonwood Canyon where a rider brought “word that the horses were not stolen.” Before morning they received orders from Salt Lake City “stating that as the horses were not stolen...we need not spend any more time in search of them but to proceed with the Indians for killing cattle as had been directed so that the nature of our expedition was not in the least changed.”
In the morning the men continued southward (to Willow Creek, present Draper, Utah) and unanimously agreed to sustain one of their own in killing a beef from a cattle herd they came upon. The Company of men enjoyed a hearty breakfast then continued on to the Jordan River (near the border of present Salt Lake and Utah Counties) where they again camped. That day they had “learned that the stolen horses had returned to Brigham's Herd by one of his boys who came to inform us of the same.” Three times the company had now received word that the Indian's had not stolen Brigham Young's horses. Even though rectifying alleged horse theft was the original stated purpose of their mission, not one of the thirty-five men turned back when that basis was shown to be a lie.
On the third day the Company crossed into the valley of the Utah Indians (Utah Valley, present Utah County) and was “divided into two Companies...the better to divide and scour the country as we did not know where the Indians were located.” They searched unsuccessfully all day and finally camped near Utah Lake on the American Creek (present American Fork, Utah.) “We were now all very tired and cold. No sign could yet be found of the Indians.”
On Sunday March 4, 1849, the Company got “an early start and traveled south to the Provo, a fine large stream and well timbered on the valley. This is a beautiful farming country. Here we found the Utahs, who...received us friendly but were much excited being evidently afraid of us. After spending an hour or so with them and learning what we could respecting those we were in pursuit of and also explaining the object of our visit we traveled on. Little Chief accompanied us about three miles up the Provo (toward Provo Canyon) where we encamped for the night.”
Two young Indian braves came to the Mormon camp and were utilized as guides who would take the Company to those whom they sought. On this clear, brightly moonlit night, the Mormons followed the Provo River to the foot of the mountains then proceeded northward along the high mountain bench (above present north Orem and Lindon, Utah.) They deposited their horses in a cedar grove on the mountainside and while most of the company waited near there, a reconnaissance party continued northward on foot until they spotted Indian campfires “in the first creek north of the Provo. It was deemed best by the party now to fall back some distance and send for the rest of the Company to join us. Accordingly two men were sent back for them while we kindled small fires to keep from freezing. About two hours before day the rear came up...All things being ready now we only waited the dawn of day to attack them.”
According to Hosea Stout, “...Our company was divided into four parties the better to surround the camp of Indians. I first started with a party to close in on the farthest side of them to prevent them from escaping to the mountains while another party...marched into the mouth of the canyon to keep them from escaping in that direction...a few horsemen formed below on the creek to be ready to pursue them in case they attempted to escape into the valley while the fourth party...marched directly into their camp. They discovered us about the time we had...surrounded them while it was yet twilight and attempted to escape in several different directions but found themselves surrounded...”
“They only saw us, and started to run up the creek for the mountains, where they found a wall of whites, they started for the south where they found another blockade, they tried to the west and found the same and there we were by this time on the north in a line of circling upon them, retreat they could not. As yet not a gun had been fired.” Before gunfire began, there was a verbal exchange with the Indians telling the Mormons to go away and the Mormons telling the Indians to surrender. “Our interpreters talked to them and told them our errand, and asked them to give themselves up. They refused. Our guide talked to them and reasoned with them, but all to no purpose, fight they would unless we went away, then they said they would come out. The guide told them they must come out then or die...The first one shot was their leader. Then such a howling and crying, I think white men never heard before.”
“The battle now commenced in good earnest and in a few moments one of the Indians was killed and several wounded...(at) times during the engagement we ceased firing and both our interpreters and the Utah (Young Indian guide) tried to persuade them to come out also to send out their women and children that they might be spared if they would not yield but all to no effect.”
“Some of the Squaws were at length found couch in the water under the thick brush and were induced to come out” when “every (LDS) man was ordered to load himself with rocks and gather in closer to the center and at the word, to shower the rocks upon them. This had the effect of bringing the women and children out, bruised and bleeding. Two men were detailed to build a fire immediately in a place secure from wind to warm and dry the poor creatures who had been in the water among the ice to be secure from bullets.” “They (the women and children) were in a most deplorable situation. Having been in the water about an hour and a half, they were nearly froze. We (the Militia) kindled up a fire for them which rendered them more comfortable. By sending these (women) back we soon prevailed on the rest to come out also...”
“Two of the women were wounded on the head with stones which we had thrown into the brush to ascertain where they were hid. Soon after they gave up we succeeded in killing two more men leaving only one more who immediately broke through the brush and tried to escape to the Utah (Indian not of the band under attack) who was on the hill looking on. He was killed however before he ran far. Thus ended the battle without one of our men even being hurt...”
When “they began to run (one Indian man) nearly succeeded in getting away, but finally fell from a shot which unjointed his neck. He fell with 18 ball holes, mostly through his body, and when he fell was running...I believe none got away. This was on the morning of the 5th of March 1849.”
“When the firing had ceased it was perhaps 8 o'clock, the sun was high up and Little Chief had come from his home (on the Provo) on horseback, since he first heard our guns. The morning was clear and calm as God ever made, and the vollies of our guns rolled down the mountain (to) Little Chief's ears...(so) he mounted his best horse and dashed up the mountainsides for ten miles...His horse, a noble animal with large extended nostrils, was as wet as the poor squaws who had laid in the creek. Little Chief was wet with tears and his horse wet with sweat.”
The old man howled, cried, moaned, hollowed, screamed and smote his breast in the greatest agony of mind when he came to us. He blamed himself and cursed the whites, and said it would not be good medicine for two or three to come up there alone as they had done before. But it was not long before a settlement and fort was made close to his village in the Ewtah Valley, and I went up there and passed that battle ground alone. The women and children (who survived the attack) went to Salt Lake City, or near it, to live...”
After an overnight journey, the Company arrived back in Salt Lake City on Tuesday March 6th, 1849, at “about 2 o'clock p.m. and were all discharged by the Colonel (John Scott) after he had given an account of our expedition to a large company who had gathered together when we came in. Amen." Four days later “at a council meeting on March 10th, Brigham Young called thirty men to settle Utah Valley at once 'for the purpose of farming, fishing and of instructing the Indians in cultivating the earth and teaching them civilization.' By March 17th thirty-three colonists were preparing to depart. The 'mission' was organized the next day.”
The settlement near the site of the March 1849 attack was for years called Battle Creek, until some time later when the Mormons (LDS) living there agreed to change the name of their town to Pleasant Grove.
How Many were Killed by the Mormon Militia?
Most accounts say four Indian men were killed, but Oliver B. Huntington stated there were more: “All the bodies we could find were carried together to one place for burial: seven great, fat stout men...When we got back (after the interchange with Little Chief and his men who approached the attack site after hearing all the gunfire) to where we left the dead, there was neither dead nor living anywhere to be found. We did not think them worth hunting for anymore, and started home.”
What Became of the Indian Women and Children?
Huntington said, “We told him (Little Chief) that the women and children were going home with us and that we would give them good clothing, plenty to eat, and houses to live in...All received homes, were made to clean themselves, and were clothed and fed like whites. All that submission and apparent content lasted but a few days, and they disappeared like young quails.” “Captain Scott...promised that if the bereft families would come to Salt Lake, they would be kindly treated and cared for by the settlers there...True to the promise, the mothers and children were taken care of for a time. In one or two instances, it is said, orphaned papooses were kept and reared by the (Mormon) pioneers. Other children with their mothers later returned to the red people.”
Is it True the Captured Indian Boy was Blackhawk?
“Joshua Terry, a pioneer of 1847, and a mountain man who married into an Indian tribe, once told the writer (Howard R. Driggs) that this Indian boy became the warring Chief Blackhawk. When peace came, after the Blackhawk War of the later eighteen sixties, this Chief, Terry declared, told him that he was this same boy taken after the fight on Battle Creek. He could never understand why the whitemen had shot down his people. It put bitterness in his heart; and though he lived for some time with the white people, his mind was ever set on avenging the wrong. That is why he later made war against them.”
Who were the Mormon Militiamen that Participated?
A partial list provided by Hosea Stout, Oliver B. Huntington, John Brown and others includes:
What Led to the Battle Creek Attack?
On June 28, 1847, before even the first Mormon pioneers arrived in present Utah, Brigham Young met with Jim Bridger and discussed the desirability of Utah Valley. William Clayton recorded this conversation in his journal:
There is no timber on the Utah Lake only on the streams which empty into it. In the outlet of the Utah Lake which runs into the Salt Lake there is an abundance of blue grass and red and white clover...the Utah tribe of Indians inhabit the region around the Utah Lake and are a bad people. If they catch a man alone they are sure to rob and abuse him if the don't kill him, but parties of men are in no danger. They are mostly armed with guns...All the valleys abound with persimmons and grapes which will make the best kind of wines. He never saw any grapes on the Utah Lake but there are plenty of cherries and berries of several kinds. He thinks the Utah Lake is the best country in the vicinity of the Salt Lake and the country is still better the farther south we go...
There is plenty of timber on all the streams and mountains and abundance of fish in the streams. There is timber all around the Utah Lake and plenty of good grass; not much of the wild sage only in patches. Wild flax grows in most of the valleys, and they are the richest lands...The Indians south of the Utah Lake and this side the desert raise corn, wheat, and other kinds of grain and produce in abundance. The Utah's abound more on the west side of the mountains near the Salt Lake than on the east side, ten to one, but we have no need to fear them for we can drive the whole of them in twenty-four hours but he would not kill them, he would make slaves of them.
During the westward journey “Brigham Young must have weighed what he had heard of Utah Valley – a paradisaical region, but with Indian complications. By his instructions a letter was written at 5 a.m. On July 21, the day Orson Pratt found his way into Salt Lake Valley, directing Pratt, on emerging from the mountains, to bear a little to the north in search of a site of settlement, for the Utes, he thought, were likely to be 'a little tenacious about their choice of lands' in Utah Valley, and it would be well to keep in Salt Lake Valley, a no-man's-land separating Ute and Shoshone territory, until they could inform themselves as to the disposition of the Indians. Initial Mormon settlement thus was on the site of Salt Lake City. Nevertheless, Young planned to explore all valleys, and, when opportunity permitted, establish settlements in those sufficiently well-watered.”
Months later, “Weak and exhausted from the overland journey, it was fitting that the (hundreds of Mormon) immigrants of 1848 should winter in the parent city or under its shadow, but with the first breath of spring, while most of the land seekers were locating in the (Salt Lake) Valley, a carefully organized and amply equipped company of thirty families pushed southward into the chosen land of the Utes, the neighboring valley to the southward. Fremont and the mountaineers had pointed to it as a particularly choice spot, so much so that for a time Heber C. Kimball weighed the advisability of making it the initial starting place. Parley P. Pratt and other visitors confirmed the early impressions of the desirability of the region. Consequently, it was natural that the Church authorities should favor this location as the second to be officially opened for settlement.”
In 1847 and 1848, nearby vicinities had been explored and favorable eye-witness accounts of Utah Valley were given to Church Authorities in Salt Lake City. Then on January 6, 1849, Brigham Young (who had been absent over 1848 while helping the Saints cross the plains to Utah) sent a party of ten men to “go to Utah Valley to learn of its capabilities for a stock range, and when the cattle go, forty or fifty men go with them.” The party recommended waiting for winter conditions to subside. Then on the last day of February 1849, the Mormon Militia (Nauvoo Legion) was called to leave their homes in Salt Lake City and go southward on a mission which culminated at Battle Creek, Utah, and which some might consider to have been essentially a preemptive strike against the Timpanogots (Ute) Indians who resided in Utah Valley.
