Donald Duck

Donald Fauntleroy Duck or Donald Duck is a funny animal cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor suit with a cap and a black or red bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and irritable personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, listed as appearing in approximately 178 theatrical films compared to Mickey Mouse's 137, and is the fifth most published comic book character in the world after Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and Wolverine.
Donald Duck rose to fame with his comedic roles in animated cartoons. His distinctive voice was created by Clarence Nash, who performed the role for 50 years. Donald's first appearance was in "The Wise Little Hen" (1934), but it was his second appearance in "Orphan's Benefit" which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse. Donald had his own show. Throughout the next two decades Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films, several of which were recognized at the Academy Awards. In the 1930s he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy and was given his own film series in 1937, starting with "Don Donald". These films introduced Donald's girlfriend Daisy Duck and sometimes featured his three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the 1956 film "Chips Ahoy", Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in "Mickey's Christmas Carol" (1983). His most recent appearance in a theatrical film was 1999's "Fantasia 2000". Donald has also appeared in direct-to-video features such as "Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas" (1999) and "" (2004) as well as television programs such as "DuckTales" (1987–1990), "Quack Pack" (1996), and "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse" (2006–2013).
Beyond animation Donald is primarily known for his appearances in comics, both in newspaper strips and comic books. Donald was most famously drawn by Al Taliaferro, Carl Barks, and Don Rosa. Barks in particular is credited for greatly expanding the "duck universe", the world in which Donald lives, and creating many additional characters such as Donald's maternal uncle Scrooge McDuck. Today Donald is a very popular character in Europe, particularly in the Low Countries and Scandinavian countries where his weekly magazine has remained the most popular comics publication for over 50 years. Disney comics' fandom is sometimes referred to as "Donaldism", a term which originated in Norway. () He has also made video game appearances, such as "QuackShot" (1991), "Donald Duck: and "Kingdom Hearts" (2002).
Origin.
The origins of Donald Duck's name was said to have been inspired by Australian cricket legend Donald Bradman. In 1932 Bradman and the Australian team were touring North America and he made the news after being dismissed for a duck against New York West Indians. Walt Disney was in the process of creating a "friend" for Mickey Mouse when he read about Bradman's dismissal in the papers and decided to name the new character "Donald Duck". Voice performer Clarence Nash auditioned for Walt Disney Studios when he learned that Disney was looking for people to create animal sounds for this cartoons. Disney was particularly impressed with Nash's duck imitation and chose him to voice the new character. Besides, during that period Mickey Mouse had lost some of his edge since becoming a role model towards children, and so Disney wanted to create a character to portray some of the more negative character traits that could no longer bestow on Mickey. Disney came up with Donald's iconic attributes including this short-temper and his sailor suit (based on ducks and sailors both being associated with water). While Dick Huemer and Art Babbit were first to animate Donald, Dick Lundy is credited for developing him as a character.
Characteristics.
Personality.
Donald's two dominant personality traits are his short temper and his positive outlook on life. Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood, without a care in the world until something comes along and spoils his day. His anger is a great cause of suffering in his life. On multiple occasions, it has caused him to get in over his head and lose competitions. There are times when he fights to keep his temper, and he sometimes succeeds in doing so temporarily, but he always returns to his normal angry self in the end.
Donald's aggressive nature has its advantages, however. While it at times it is a hindrance, and even a handicap, it has also helped him in times of need. When faced with a threat of some kind, for example Pete's attempts to intimidate him, he is initially scared, but his fear is replaced by anger. As a result, instead of running away, he fights—with ghosts, sharks, mountain goats, giant kites, and even the forces of nature. And, more often than not, when he fights, he comes out on top.
Donald is something of a prankster, and as a result, he can sometimes come across as a bit of a bully, especially in the way he sometimes treats his nephews and Chip 'n' Dale. As the animator Fred Spencer has put it:
However, with a few exceptions, there is seldom any malice in Donald's pranks. He almost never intends to hurt anyone, and whenever his pranks go too far, he is always very regretful. In Truant Officer Donald, for example, when he is tricked into believing he has accidentally killed Huey, Dewey and Louie, he shows great remorse, blaming himself. His nephews appear in the form of angels, and he willingly endures a kick by one of the them---that is, of course, until he realizes he has been played for a sap, whereupon he promptly loses his temper.
Donald is also a bit of a show-off. He likes to brag, especially about how skilled he is at something. He does in fact have many skills—he is something of a Jack of all Trades. Amongst other things, he is a good fisher and a good hockey player. However, his love of bragging often leads him to overestimate his abilities, so that when he sets out to make good on his boasts, he gets in over his head, usually to hilarious effect.
Another of his personality traits is tenacity. Even though he can at times be lazy, and likes to say that his favorite place to be is in a hammock, once he has committed to accomplishing something he goes for it 100 percent, sometimes resorting to extreme measures to reach his goal.
Phrases.
Donald has a few memorable phrases that he occasionally comes out with in certain situations. For example, when he stumbles across other characters in the midst of planning some sort of retaliation or prank, or when things don't go as he'd planned or don't work properly, he often says, "What's the big idea!?". When he has given up on something he's been trying to do, or something he's been hoping will happen, he tends to say, "Aw, phooey!". When he confronts someone who's been antagonizing him, or something that's been frustrating him, he likes to exclaim, "So!!". He greets his friend Daisy, and occasionally others, with, "Hiya, toots!". And when he's very excited about something, he usually mutters, "Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy..." under his breath.
Health.
There's a running gag in the Donald Duck comics about him being out of shape and unwilling to exercise. Usually, some character close to Donald annoys him by saying he's being lazy and needs to get some exercise. But despite his apparent slothfulness, Donald proves that he is physically strong. In the short film, "Sea Scouts", Donald is traveling with his nephews in a boat when it's attacked by a shark. Donald makes several attempts to defeat the shark, each of which proves ineffective, but then finally triumphs and defeats the shark with a single well-placed punch.
Rivalry with Mickey Mouse.
Throughout his career, Donald has shown that he's jealous of Mickey and wants his job as Disney's greatest star, similar to the Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck rivalry. In most Disney theatrical cartoons, Mickey and Donald are shown as partners and have little to no rivalry (exceptions being "The Band Concert". "Magician Mickey" and near the end of "Symphony Hour, "which were due to Donald's menacing attempts). However by the time "The Mickey Mouse Club" aired on television (after Bugs vs. Daffy cartoons such as Rabbit Fire), it was shown that Donald always wanted the spotlight. One animated short that rivaled the famous Mickey Mouse March song was showing Huey, Dewey, and Louie as Boy Scouts and Donald as their Scoutmaster at a cliff near a remote forest and Donald leads them in a song mirroring the Mouseketeers theme "D-O-N-A-L-D D-U-C-K! Donald Duck!" The rivalry would cause Donald some problems, in a 1988 TV special, where Mickey is cursed by a sorcerer to become unnoticed, the world believes Mickey to be kidnapped. Donald Duck is then arrested for the kidnapping of Mickey, as he is considered to be the chief suspect, due to their rivalry. However, Donald did later get the charges dismissed, due to lack of evidence. Walt Disney, in his "Wonderful World of Color", would sometimes make reference to the rivalry. Walt, one time, had presented Donald with a gigantic birthday cake and commented how it was "even bigger than Mickey's", which pleased Donald. The clip was rebroadcast in November 1984 during a TV special honoring Donald's 50th birthday, with Dick Van Dyke substituting for Walt.
The rivalry between Mickey and Donald has also been shown in "Disney's House of Mouse". It was shown that Donald wanted to be the Club's founder and wanted to change the name from "House of Mouse" to "House of Duck", which is obvious in the episodes "The Stolen Cartoons" and "Timon and Pumbaa". However, in later episodes, Donald accepted that Mickey was the founder and worked with Mickey as a partner to make the club profitable and successful.
Enemies.
Donald has numerous enemies, who range from comical foil to annoying nemesis: Chip 'n' Dale, Humphrey the Bear, Spike The Bee, Mountain Lion Louie, Bootle Beetle, Witch Hazel (in "Trick or Treat"), Aracuan Bird and Baby Shelby (in "Mickey Mouse Works").
In the comics, he is often pestered and tormented by the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell, Gladstone Gander and Mr. Jones.
In the videogame "", he saves Daisy from Merlock.
History.
Donald in animation.
Early appearances.
Donald Duck first appeared in the 1934 cartoon "The Wise Little Hen" which was part of the "Silly Symphonies" series of theatrical cartoon shorts. The film's release date of June 9 is officially recognized by the Walt Disney Company as Donald's birthday despite a couple in-universe contradictions. Donald's appearance in the cartoon, as created by animator Dick Lundy, is similar to his modern look — the feather and beak colors are the same, as is the blue sailor shirt and hat — but his features are more elongated, his body plumper, and his feet smaller. Donald's personality is not developed either; in the short, he only fills the role of the unhelpful friend from the original story.
Burt Gillett brought Donald back in his Mickey Mouse cartoon, "Orphan's Benefit", released August 11, 1934. Donald is one of a number of characters who are giving performances in a benefit for Mickey's Orphans. Donald's act is to recite the poems "Mary Had a Little Lamb" and "Little Boy Blue", but every time he tries, the mischievous orphans heckle him, leading the duck to fly into a squawking fit of anger. This explosive personality would remain with Donald for decades to come.
Donald continued to be a hit with audiences. The character began appearing regularly in most Mickey Mouse cartoons. Cartoons from this period, such as the 1935 cartoon "The Band Concert" — in which Donald repeatedly disrupts the Mickey Mouse Orchestra's rendition of "The William Tell Overture" by playing "Turkey in the Straw" — are regularly hailed by critics as exemplary films and classics of animation. Animator Ben Sharpsteen also minted the classic "Mickey, Donald, and Goofy" comedy in 1935, with the cartoon "Mickey's Service Station".
In 1936, Donald was redesigned to be a bit fuller, rounder, and cuter, the first to feature this design was the cartoon "Moving Day". He also began starring in solo cartoons, the first of which was the January 9, 1937 Ben Sharpsteen cartoon, "Don Donald". This short also introduced a love interest of Donald's, "Donna Duck", who evolved into Daisy Duck. Donald's nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie, would make their first animated appearance a year later in the April 15, 1938 film, "Donald's Nephews", directed by Jack King (they had been earlier introduced in the Donald Duck comic strip by Al Taliaferro, see below). By 1938, most polls showed that Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse. Disney could, however, help Mickey regain popularity by redesigning him, giving him his most appealing design as production for the "Fantasia" segment "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" began in 1938.
After his early appearances, he went on to become part of the famed trio Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. He appeared in many of the cartoons, including "Moving Day".
Wartime Donald.
Several of Donald's shorts during the war were propaganda films, most notably "Der Fuehrer's Face", released on January 1, 1943. In it, Donald plays a worker in an artillery factory in "Nutzi Land" (Nazi Germany). He struggles with long working hours, very small food rations, and having to salute every time he sees a picture of the Führer (Adolf Hitler). These pictures appear in many places, such as on the assembly line in which he is screwing in the detonators of various sizes of shells. In the end he becomes little more than a small part in a faceless machine with no choice but to obey until he falls, suffering a nervous breakdown. Then Donald wakes up to find that his experience was in fact a dream. At the end of the short Donald looks to the Statue of Liberty and the American flag with renewed appreciation. "Der Fuehrer's Face" won the 1942 Academy Award for Animated Short Film. "Der Fuehrer's Face" was also the first of two animated short films to be set during the War to win an Oscar, the other being Tom and Jerry's short film, "The Yankee Doodle Mouse".
Other notable shorts from this period include seven films mini-series that follow Donald's life in the US Army from his drafting to his life in basic training under sergeant Pete to his first actual mission as a commando having to sabotage a Japanese air base. Titles in the series include:
Thanks in part to these films, Donald graced the nose artwork of virtually every type of WWII Allied combat aircraft, from the L-4 Grasshopper to the B-29 Superfortress.
Donald also appears as a mascot—such as in the Army Air Corps 309th Fighter Squadron and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, which showed Donald as a fierce-looking pirate ready to defend the American coast from invaders. Donald also appeared as a mascot emblem for: 415th Fighter Squadron; 438th Fighter Squadron; 479th Bombardment Squadron; 531st Bombardment Squadron. He also appears as the mascot for the United States Air Force 319 Aircraft Maintenance Unit at Luke Air Force Base. He is seen wearing an old-style pilot's uniform with a board with a nail in it in one hand and a lightning bolt in the other hand. Donald's most famous appearance, however, was on North American Aviation B-25B Mitchell medium bomber (S/N 40-2261) piloted by Lt. Ted W. Lawson of the 95th Bombardment Squadron, USAAF. The aircraft, named the "Ruptured Duck" and carrying a picture of Donald's face above a pair of crossed crutches, was one of sixteen B-25Bs which took off from the aircraft carrier USS "Hornet" to bomb Tokyo on April 18, 1942. The mission was led by Lieutenant Colonel (later General) Jimmy Doolittle. Like most of the aircraft that participated in the mission, the Ruptured Duck was unable to reach its assigned landing field in China following the raid and ended up ditching off the coast near Shangchow, China. The Ruptured Duck's pilot survived, with the loss of a leg, and later wrote about the Doolittle Raid in the book, later to be the movie, "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" (Random House pub. 1943).
During World War II, Disney cartoons were not allowed to be imported into Occupied Europe owing to their propagandistic content. Since this cost Disney a lot of money, he decided to create a new audience for his films in South America. He decided to make a trip through various Latin American countries with his assistants, and use their experiences and impressions to create two feature-length animation films. The first was "Saludos Amigos", which consisted of four short segments, two of them with Donald Duck. In the first, he meets his parrot pal Jose Carioca. The second film was "The Three Caballeros", in which he meets his rooster friend Panchito.
Post-war animation.
Many of Donald's films made after the war recast the duck as the brunt of some other character's pestering. Donald is repeatedly attacked, harassed, and ridiculed by his nephews, by the chipmunks Chip 'n' Dale, or by other characters such as Humphrey the Bear, Spike the Bee, Bootle Beetle, the Aracuan Bird, Louie the Mountain Lion, or a colony of ants. In effect, much like Bugs Bunny cartoons from Warner Bros. the Disney artists had reversed the classic screwball scenario perfected by Walter Lantz and others in which the main character is the "instigator" of these harassing behaviors, rather than the butt of them. The short 'Clown Of The Jungle' (1947) very much feels like either a Daffy Duck or a Woody Woodpecker cartoon.
The post-war Donald also starred in educational films, such as "Donald in Mathmagic Land" and "How to Have an Accident at Work" (both 1959), and made cameos in various Disney projects, such as "The Reluctant Dragon" (1941) and the "Disneyland" television show (1959). For this latter show, Donald's uncles Ludwig von Drake (1961) and Scrooge McDuck (1967) were then created in animation.
Clarence Nash voiced Donald for the last time in "Mickey's Christmas Carol" (1983), making Donald the only character in the film to be voiced by his original actor. Since Nash's death in 1985, Donald's voice has been provided by Tony Anselmo, who was mentored by Nash. Anselmo's voice is heard for the first time in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?". In this movie, Donald has a piano duel scene with his Warner Brothers counterpart and rival Daffy Duck voiced by Mel Blanc. Donald has since appeared in several different television shows and (short) animated movies. He played roles in "The Prince and the Pauper" and made a cameo appearance in "A Goofy Movie."
Donald had a rather small part in the animated television series "DuckTales". There, Donald joins the Navy, and leaves his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie with their Uncle Scrooge, who then has to take care of them. Donald's role in the overall series was fairly limited, as he only ended up appearing in a handful of episodes. Some of the stories in the series were loosely based on the comics by Carl Barks.
Donald made some cameo appearances in "Bonkers", before getting his own television show "Quack Pack". This series featured a modernized Duck family. Donald was no longer wearing his sailor suit and hat, but a Hawaiian shirt. Huey, Dewey, and Louie now are teenagers, with distinct clothing, voices, and personalities. Daisy Duck has lost her pink dress and bow and has a new hairdo. Oddly enough, no other family members, besides Ludwig von Drake, appear in "Quack Pack", and all other Duckburg citizens are humans, and not dogs.
He made a comeback as the star of the "Noah's Ark" segment of "Fantasia 2000", as first mate to Noah. Donald musters the animals to the Ark and attempts to control them. He tragically believes that Daisy has been lost, while she believes the same of him, but they are reunited at the end. All this to Edward Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance" Marches 1–4.
In an alternate opening for the 2005 Disney film "Chicken Little", Donald would have made a cameo appearance as "Ducky Lucky". This scene can be found on the "Chicken Little" DVD.
Donald also played an important role in "Mickey Mouse Works" and "House of Mouse". In the latter show, he is the co-owner of Mickey's night club. He is part of the ensemble cast of classic characters in the TV show "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse" as well. He also appears in the new 3-minute Mickey Mouse TV shorts for Disney Channel.
Donald in comics.
While Donald's cartoons enjoy vast popularity in the United States and around the world, his weekly and monthly comic books enjoy their greatest popularity in many European countries, especially Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland, but also Germany, the Netherlands, and Greece. Most of them are produced and published by the Italian branch of the Walt Disney Company in Italy and by Egmont in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. In Germany, the comics are published by Ehapa which has since become part of the Egmont empire. Donald-comics are also being produced in The Netherlands and France. Donald also has been appeared in Japanese comics published by Kodansha and Tokyopop.
According to the INDUCKS, which is a database about Disney comics worldwide, American, Italian and Danish stories have been reprinted in the following countries. In most of them, publications still continue: Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, the People's Republic of China, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark (Faroe Islands), Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia.
Early development.
Though a 1931 Disney publication called "Mickey Mouse Annual" mentioned a character named Donald Duck, the character's first appearance in comic-strip format was a newspaper cartoon that was based on the short "The Wise Little Hen" and published in 1934. For the next few years, Donald made a few more appearances in Disney-themed strips, and by 1936, he had grown to be one of the most popular characters in the "Silly Symphonies" comic strip. Ted Osborne was the primary writer of these strips, with Al Taliaferro as his artist. Osborne and Taliaferro also introduced several members of Donald's supporting cast, including his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
In 1937, an Italian publisher named Mondadori created the first Donald Duck story intended specifically for comic books. The eighteen-page story, written by Federico Pedrocchi, is the first to feature Donald as an adventurer rather than simply a comedic character. Fleetway in England also began publishing comic-book stories featuring the duck.
Developments under Taliaferro.
A daily "Donald Duck" comic strip drawn by Taliaferro and written by Bob Karp began running in the United States on February 2, 1938; the Sunday strip began the following year. Taliaferro and Karp created an even larger cast of characters for Donald's world. He got a new St. Bernard named Bolivar, and his family grew to include cousin Gus Goose and grandmother Elvira Coot. Donald's new rival girlfriends were Donna and Daisy Duck. Taliaferro also gave Donald his very own automobile, a 1934 Belchfire Runabout, in a 1938 story.
Developments under Barks.
In 1942, Western Publishing began creating original comic-book stories about Donald and other Disney characters. Bob Karp worked on the earliest of these, a story called "Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold". The new publisher meant new illustrators, however: Carl Barks and Jack Hannah. Barks would later repeat the treasure-hunting theme in many more stories.
Barks soon took over the major development of the duck as both writer and illustrator. Under his pen, Donald kept his personality traits, but became more adventurous. Pete was the only other major character from the "Mickey Mouse" comic strip to feature in Barks' new Donald Duck universe.
Barks placed Donald in the city of Duckburg, which he populated with a host of supporting players, including Neighbour Jones (1944), Uncle Scrooge McDuck (1947), Gladstone Gander (1948), the Beagle Boys (1951), Gyro Gearloose (1952), April, May and June (1953), Flintheart Glomgold (1956), Magica de Spell (1961), and John D. Rockerduck (1961). Many of Taliaferro's characters made the move to Barks' world as well, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Barks placed Donald in both domestic and adventure scenarios, and Uncle Scrooge became one of his favorite characters to pair up with Donald. Scrooge's popularity grew, and by 1952, the character had a comic book of his own. At this point, Barks concentrated his major efforts on the Scrooge stories, and Donald's appearances became more focused on comedy or he was recast as Scrooge's reluctant helper, following his rich uncle around the globe.
Further developments.
Dozens of writers continued to utilize Donald in their stories around the world.
For example the Disney Studio artists, who made comics directly for the European market. Two of them, Dick Kinney (1917–1985) and Al Hubbard (1915–1984) created Donald's cousin Fethry Duck.
The American artists Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl (1915–1991), who were working directly for the American comic books, created Moby Duck. Strobl was one of the most productive Disney artists of all time, and drew many stories which Barks wrote and sketched after his retirement. In the 1990s and early 2000s, these scripts were re-drawn in a style closer to Barks' own by Dutch artist Daan Jippes.
Italian publisher Mondadori created many of the stories that were published throughout Europe. They also introduced numerous new characters who are today well known in Europe. One example is Donald Duck's alter-ego, a superhero called Paperinik in Italian, created in 1969 by Guido Martina (1906–1991) and Giovan Battista Carpi (1927–1999).
Giorgio Cavazzano and Carlo Chendi created "Umperio Bogarto", a detective whose name is an obvious parody on Humphrey Bogart. They also created O.K Quack, an extraterrestrial Duck who landed on earth in a spaceship in the shape of a coin. He however lost his spaceship, and befriended Scrooge, and now is allowed to search through his moneybin time after time, looking for his ship.
Romano Scarpa (1927–2005), who was a very important and influential Italian Disney artist, created Brigitta McBridge, a female Duck who is madly in love with Scrooge. Her affections are never answered by him, though, but she keeps trying. Scarpa also came up with Dickie Duck, the granddaughter of Glittering Goldie (Scrooge's possible love-interest from his days in the Klondike) and Kildare Coot, a nephew of Grandma Duck.
Italian artist Corrado Mastantuono created Bum Bum Ghigno, a cynical, grumpy and not too good looking Duck who teams up with Donald and Gyro a lot.
The American artist William van Horn also introduced a new character: Rumpus McFowl, an old and rather corpulent Duck with a giant appetite and laziness, who is first said to be a cousin of Scrooge. Only later, Scrooge reveals to his nephews Rumpus is actually his half-brother. Later, Rumpus also finds out.
Working for the Danish editor Egmont, artist Daniel Branca (1951–2005) and script-writers Paul Halas and Charlie Martin created Sonny Seagull, an orphan who befriends Huey, Dewey and Louie, and his rival, Mr. Phelps.
One of the most productive Duck-artist used to be Victor Arriagada Rios, (deceased 2012) better known under the name Vicar. He had his own studio where he and his assistants drew the stories sent in by Egmont. With writer/editors Stefan and Unn Printz-Påhlson, Vicar created the character Oona, a prehistoric duck princess who traveled to modern Duckburg by using Gyro's time-machine. She stayed, and is still seen in occasional modern stories.
The best-known and most popular Duck-artist of this time is American Don Rosa. He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone. He later worked briefly for the Dutch editors, but moved to work directly for Egmont soon afterwards. His stories contain many direct references to stories by Carl Barks, and he also wrote and illustrated a 12-part series of stories about the life of Scrooge McDuck, which won him two Eisner Awards.
Other important artists who have worked with Donald are Freddy Milton and Daan Jippes, who made 18 ten-pagers which experts claim, were very difficult to separate from Barks' own work from the late 1940s.
Japanese artist Shiro Amano worked with Donald on the graphic novel "Kingdom Hearts" based on the Disney-SquareEnix videogame.
Donald Duck outside the United States.
Donald Duck has a slightly different character abroad.
Nordic Countries.
Donald Duck ("Kalle Anka" in Sweden, "Anders And" in Denmark, "Andrés Önd" in Iceland, "Donald Duck" in Norway, and "Aku Ankka" in Finland) is a very popular character in Nordic countries. In the mid-1930s, Robert S. Hartman, a German who served as a representative of Walt Disney, visited Sweden to supervise the merchandise distribution of Sagokonst (The Art of Fables). Hartman found a studio called L'Ateljé Dekoratör, which produced illustrated cards that were published by Sagokonst. Since the Disney characters on the cards appeared to be exactly 'on-model', Hartman asked the studio to create a local version of the English-language "Mickey Mouse Weekly". In 1937 L'Ateljé Dekoratör began publishing "Musse Pigg Tidningen" ("Mickey Mouse Magazine"), which had high production values and spanned 23 issues; most of the magazine's content came from local producers, while some material consisted of reprints from "Mickey Mouse Weekly". The comic anthology ended in 1938. Hartman helped Disney establish offices in all Nordic countries before he left Disney in 1941. Donald became the most popular of the Disney characters in Scandinavia, and Scandinavians recognise him better than Mickey Mouse. "Kalle Anka & Co", Donald's first dedicated Swedish anthology, started in September 1948. In 2001 the Finnish Post Office issued a stamp set to commemorate the 50th year anniversary of Donald's presence in Finland. By 2005 around one out of every four Norwegians read the Norwegian edition "Donald Duck & Co." per week, translating to around 1.3 million regular readers. During the same year, every week 434,000 Swedes read "Kalle Anka & Co". By 2005 in Finland the Donald Duck anthology "Aku Ankka" sold 270,000 copies per issue. Tim Pilcher and Brad Books, authors of "The Essential Guide to World Comics", described the Donald anthologies as "the Scandinavian equivalent of the UK's "Beano" or "Dandy", a comic that generations have grown up with, from grandparents to grandchildren."
Hannu Raittila, an author, says that Finnish people recognize an aspect of themselves in Donald; Raittila cites that Donald attempts to retrieve himself from "all manner of unexpected and unreasonable scrapes using only his wits and the slim resources he can put his hands on, all of which meshes nicely with the popular image of Finland as driftwood in the crosscurrents of world politics." Finnish voters placing "protest votes" typically write "Donald Duck" as the candidate. In Sweden voters often voted for Donald Duck or the Donald Duck Party as a nonexistent candidate until a 2006 change in voting laws, which prohibited voting for nonexistent candidates. In a twenty-year span Donald won enough votes to be, in theory, Sweden's ninth-most popular political organization. In 1985 Donald received 291 votes in an election for the Parliament of Sweden (Riksdag).
By 1978, within Finland there was debate over the morality of Donald Duck. Matti Holopainen jokingly criticized Donald for living with Daisy while not being married to her, for not wearing trousers, and for, in the words of the "Library Journal", being "too bourgeois". Some observers from Finland from the same time period supported Donald, referring to him as a "genuine proletarian...forced to sell his labor at slave rates to make a living". The "Library Journal" stated that it had been revealed that, since 1950, Donald had secretly been married to Daisy.
An annual Christmas special in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden is "From All of Us to All of You", in Norway and Sweden with a title of "Donald Duck and His Friends Celebrate Christmas". Segments include "Ferdinand the Bull", a short with Chip 'n' Dale, a segment from "Lady and the Tramp", a sneak preview of a coming Disney movie and concludes with Jiminy Cricket performing "When You Wish Upon a Star". To many people watching this special is a tradition as important as having a Christmas tree.
Germany.
Donald Duck is very popular in Germany, where Donald themed comics sell an average of 250,000 copies each week, mostly published in the kids’ weekly "Micky Maus" and the monthly "Donald Duck Special" (for adults). The "Wall Street Journal" called Donald Duck "The Jerry Lewis of Germany", a reference to American star Jerry Lewis' popularity in France. Donald's dialogue in German comics tends to be more sophisticated and philosophical, he "quotes from German literature, speaks in grammatically complex sentences and is prone to philosophical musings, while the stories often take a more political tone than their American counterparts", features especially associated with Erika Fuchs's popular German translations of the comics created by "The Good Duck Artist" Carl Barks. Christian Pfeiler – former president of D.O.N.A.L.D., a German acronym which stands for "German Organization for Non-commercial Followers of Pure Donaldism" – says Donald is popular in Germany because "almost everyone can identify with him. He has strengths and weaknesses; he lacks polish but is also very cultured and well-read." It is through this everyman persona that Donald is able to voice philosophical truths about German society that appeal to both children and adults. Donald's writers and illustrators Carl Barks, Don Rosa and Ub Iwerks are well known in Germany, and have their own fan clubs.
Italy.
Donald Duck (named Paolino Paperino) is also a very popular character in Italy, where new stories about him and Scrooge McDuck are hosted in the kids' weekly "Topolino" and the monthly "Paperino". While "Paperino" is written by many authors, he still maintains several characteristics. He's mostly an everyman, but the fierce, harsh temper he has in the American comic appears to be diluted into a meek, weaker personality, prone to comical fits of rage that are mostly subdued by the realization of its impotence. His frustration at Gladstone's luck is comically enhanced: in the Italian comics Donald is chronically unlucky, unable to do or get anything right, with Gladstone taking advantage of his superiority or taking genuine pity of his unlucky cousin and trying several plans to grant him some better luck, always failing.
However the constant search for an outlet to vent his frustration, led the Italian rendition of Donald Duck to seek his catharsis in several ways: in the sixties, vexed by Scrooge's antics and Gladstone luck, he reinvented himself as Paperinik, the "Duck Avenger" (as he came to be known outside Italy), an anti-hero at first, a self-assured, well adjusted, brilliant hero in later stories, no longer bound by the self-doubt and the mockery Donald is constantly subjected. Further along the years, he fashioned for himself the additional identies of "QQ7", a bumbling secret agent protecting Scrooge's riches and "DoubleDuck", a more confident and suave secret agent, in the mold of James Bond, a more equilibrate mold of the heroic Duck Avenger and the tricky QQ7, often accompanied by the beautiful spy "Kay K". Donald's "secret identies" are hosted in the main "Topolino" comics, but also in several themed comics, like the now defunct "Paperinik", "PKNA", "PK^2" and the current "Paperinik AppGrade", the latter hosting reprints and new stories as well.
Having several full lives to live doesn't hamper Donald's ability to live adventures on his own: he still lives adventures with his uncle Scrooge and his nephews (often acting as a reluctant bumbler, a ballast to the enthusiasm of his nephews and the wanderlust of his uncle), and he lived a starcrossed love story with a princess from another planet, "Reginella". Despite Reginella left a deep trace in Donald's heart, he's still depicted as extremely faithful to Daisy, with a small hiccup deriving by Daisy Duck having a secret identity on her own ("Paperinika"), with Paperinik and Paperinika, both unaware of their secret identities, cultivating a permanent status of belligerent tension.
He also keeps a cheerful rivalry with his neighbour "Bum Bum Ghigno", more a bumbler and a nuisance than he is, but still a good person at heart.
Oddly enough, the Italian rendition of Donald Duck seldom, if ever, goes by his first name, having everyone, including his nephews, Daisy and Uncle Scrooge, address him as "Paperino" (his Italian surname). While the matter was never clarified, his choice fits with the extreme loathing of his first name expressed by his mother Hortense.
Disney theme parks.
Donald Duck has played a major role in many Disney theme parks over the years. He has actually been seen in more attractions and shows at the parks than Mickey Mouse has. He has appeared over the years in such attractions as Animagique, Mickey Mouse Revue, Mickey's PhilharMagic, , Gran Fiesta Tour Starring the Three Caballeros and the updated version of "it's a small world". He also is seen in the parks as a meet-and-greet character.
One long-ago-scrapped idea was also to have a bumper boat ride themed to Donald Duck.
Donald in children's books.
Donald has been a frequent character in children's books beginning in 1935. Most of these books were published by Whitman Publishing, later called Western Publishing, or one of its subsidiaries. The following is a list of children's books in which Donald is the central character. This does not include comic books or activity books such as coloring books.

Hesychius of Cazorla

Saint Hesychius (; ) is venerated as the patron saint of Cazorla, Spain. Tradition makes him a Christian missionary of the 1st century, during the Apostolic Age. He evangelized the town of "Carcere", "Carteia", or "Carcesi", identified as Cazorla, became its first bishop, and was martyred there by being stoned to death at a place called La Pedriza. 
He is one of the group of Seven Apostolic Men ("siete varones apostólicos"), seven Christian clerics ordained in Rome by Saints Peter and Paul and sent to evangelize Spain. Besides Hesychius, this group includes Sts. Torquatus, Caecilius, Ctesiphon, Euphrasius, Indaletius, and Secundius ("Torcuato, Cecilio, Tesifonte, Eufrasio, Hesiquio y Segundo"). 
The identification of the places where they are said to have evangelized is imprecise: sources also state that "Carcere" or "Carcesi" is not Cazorla but Cieza.

USS West Bridge (ID-2888)

USS "West Bridge" (ID-2888) was a cargo ship in the United States Navy during World War I. She was begun as SS "War Topaz" but was completed as SS "West Bridge, though she was referred to in some publications under the spelling Westbridge". After the ship was decommissioned from the Navy, the ship returned to civilian service as SS "West Bridge", but was renamed SS "Barbara Cates", and SS "Pan Gulf" over the course of her civilian career under American registry. Near the end of World War II, the ship was renamed SS "Lermontov" () when she sailed under the Soviet flag.
"West Bridge" was one of the "West" ships, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built for the on the West Coast of the United States. The ship was launched in April 1918 and delivered to the U.S. Navy upon completion in May. After commissioning, USS "West Bridge" sailed from the Pacific Northwest to the East Coast of the United States and joined a convoy of cargo ships headed to France in August. After "West Bridge" suffered an engine breakdown at sea, the convoy was attacked by two German submarines and "West Bridge" was torpedoed and abandoned. A salvage crew from American destroyer boarded the ship the following day, and, working with four tugs dispatched from France, successfully brought the ship into port. Four men received the Navy Cross for their efforts in saving "West Bridge".
After seven months of repair, "West Bridge" resumed Navy service until her December 1919 decommissioning and return to the . "West Bridge" was laid up for nearly seven years from 1922 to 1929, when she was sold for service on an intercoastal cargo service under the name SS "Barbara Cates". By 1938, the ship had been renamed "Pan Gulf" for service with a subsidiary of the Waterman Steamship Company. During World War II, "Pan Gulf" made nine roundtrips between the United States and the United Kingdom without incident in wartime convoys. She also sailed between New York and ports on the Gulf Coast and in the Caribbean. In May 1945, the ship was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease. Renamed SS "Lermontov", the ship sailed in support of the war and continued in civilian service for the Soviets until 1966, when she was scrapped at Split.
Design and construction.
To replace shipping tonnage lost to German submarines during World War I, the British Shipping Controller sought newly built ships from American shipyards. As part of of shipping which had been ordered by March 1917, an order for nine vessels of was placed with J. F. Duthie & Company of Seattle. Because the United States had not yet entered World War I, the Shipping Controller, to skirt neutrality laws, placed orders through various British shipping companies. Although the specific company that placed the order with Duthie is not reported in secondary sources, the company most often used for these orders was the Cunard Steamship Company. As one of the nine ships ordered, J. F. Duthie & Company laid down the keel of "War Topaz" as the eleventh ship begun at their shipyard.
On 6 August 1917, the Emergency Fleet Corporation—an entity created by the shortly after the United States entered the war on 6 April and tasked with overseeing U.S. shipbuilding—requisitioned most ships under construction in the United States; included among those was "War Topaz". By the time of her 24 April 1918 launch, the ship had been renamed "West Bridge", becoming one of the "West" ships, cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States. Just a bit over one month later, on 26 May, the finished "West Bridge" was delivered to the United States Navy.
As completed, the steel-hulled ship was long (between perpendiculars), abeam, and drew . "West Bridge" had a displacement of , and her -deep hold allowed the ship to be rated at . The ship was powered by a single triple-expansion steam engine built by the Hooven, Owens, & Rentschler Company of Hamilton, Ohio. The engine, with cylinders of , , and 72 inches (62, 105, and 180 cm) diameter with a stroke, was capable of generating up to , allowing the single screw propeller to move the ship at up . For her U.S. Navy service in World War I, "West Bridge" was equipped with one and one gun.
Military career.
USS "West Bridge" (ID-2888) was commissioned into the at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 26 May with Lieutenant Commander Mortimer Hawkins, , in command. "West Bridge" took on an initial load of flour and departed 10 June for the East Coast. Along the way, the ship developed troubles with her engine, which required her to put in at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone for repairs. Getting under way again on 4 July, "West Bridge" sailed for New York, arriving on 16 July.
After refueling at New York, "West Bridge" joined Convoy HB-8 bound for France, sailing on 1 August in company with Navy cargo ship , United States Army transport , and 13 others. Escorted by armed yacht , destroyers and , and French cruiser "Marseillaise", the convoy was some west of its destination of Le Verdon-sur-Mer by the end of the day on 15 August.
Torpedo attack.
At 17:40, "West Bridge"s engine broke down once again and her crew was unable to repair it. "West Bridge", falling off the back of the convoy and adrift, signaled "Marseillaise" to request a tow. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, "Montanan"—still in the convoy, which was by now some ahead of "West Bridge"—was hit by one of three torpedoes launched by German submarine . "Montanan" began to settle and was quickly abandoned. On "West Bridge", Lieutenant Commander Hawkins realized the potential for another submarine attack and ordered his crew to general quarters and reduced the number of men in the mechanical spaces below decks. "Noma" sailed back to "West Bridge", ordered the freighter to extinguish her lights, and stood by. At nearly the same time, approached and launched two torpedoes at the stationary cargo ship, scoring hits with both. The first struck near the No. 3 cargo hold in the front of the ship, while the second hit amidships near the engine room. "West Bridge" immediately began listing to starboard, and Hawkins ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. He and two crewmen remained behind until they felt sure that everyone else had departed. By the time they left the stricken ship, water was up to the gunwales and lapping at the well deck.
Immediately after the attack, "Noma" sped off to depth charge the submarine while sending an SOS for "West Bridge", since the initial explosion destroyed the cargo ship's wireless. Destroyer "Burrows" arrived to take on "West Bridge"s survivors, who had situated themselves about a mile (2 km) from the still-floating "West Bridge". After boarding the destroyer, a head count revealed that four men were missing, but it also turned up two female stowaways.
By the morning of 16 August, both "Montanan" and "West Bridge" were still afloat, albeit with decks awash. Despite attempts to get "Montanan" under tow, she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to "West Bridge" to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised "Burrows" captain that the situation was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship, crew, and the "West Bridge" survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, "Burrows" departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer "Smith" to stand by "West Bridge".
A volunteer work and salvage party from "Smith", led by Lieutenant Richard L. Conolly, and which included Chief Boatswain's Mate John Henry Caudell, and Construction Mechanic, 3rd class Walter Homer Todd, boarded "West Bridge" and awaited four tugs which had been dispatched from Brest: the U.S. Navy tug , two French tugs, and one British tug. Over the course of the next five days, the tugs, joined by patrol yacht , slowly made their way to the French coast, eventually arriving at Brest. "West Bridge" was towed over with only 1% buoyancy remaining. Conolly, Caudell, and Todd were each awarded the Navy Cross for their efforts in saving "West Bridge"; W. W. Wotherspoon, the fleet salvage officer on "Favorite" was also honored with a Navy Cross, in part for his salvage efforts for "West Bridge".
The extent of the damage and the condition of "West Bridge" led to some erroneous reports of her loss. News articles on 24 August in both "The New York Times" and the "Chicago Daily Tribune" reported the loss of "West Bridge", and the mistaken information also made it into book form. Authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson, in their work "The Road to France: The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies, 1917–1918", repeat the misinformation about the loss of "West Bridge".
After "West Bridge" underwent seven months of repairs, the ship resumed service with the through 1 December 1919, at which time she was decommissioned and handed over to the .
Interwar years.
Little is known about "West Bridge"s activities after her return to the in 1919, but in June 1922 she was laid up in Philadelphia, where she would remain for almost seven years. In March 1929, the approved the sale of "West Bridge" for $57,000 to the Sudden and Christenson Steamship Company of San Francisco. By May, the ship had been renamed "Barbara Cates" and was slated for service on the intercoastal freight service of their Arrow Line, which sailed to the Pacific coast from Baltimore; Norfolk, Virginia; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida. The addition of "Barbara Cates" and other ships purchased around the same time allowed the Arrow Line to increase its sailings from fortnightly to once every ten days. "Barbara Cates" nine years with the Arrow Line were uneventful.
By October 1938, the ship had been renamed "Pan Gulf" to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and it is likely that "Pan Gulf" called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston during this time.
In October 1941, "The Christian Science Monitor" reported that "Pan Gulf" had become stuck in the mud off Governors Island after her crew misjudged how far to back out of her berth at the Army base there. The first, unsuccessful attempt to free "Pan Gulf" from her predicament involved eight tugs, but the ship did not budge. The newspaper, which had also reported that there was no apparent damage to "Pan Gulf" in the grounding, carried no further reports on the ship.
World War II and later career.
After the United States entered World War II, "Pan Gulf" frequently sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic, as well as some in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Between April and September 1942, "Pan Gulf" made two roundtrips from the U.S. to Liverpool. In September, the cargo ship sailed from New York to the Caribbean to take on a load of bauxite in early November, and then sailed on to Galveston, Texas, before returning to New York in mid-February 1943.
In late February, "Pan Gulf" began the first of a further seven roundtrips to the United Kingdom over the next 21 months, when she sailed from New York in Convoy HX 228 for Halifax. In July, the purchased "Pan Gulf" from the Pan-Atlantic Line, overpaying her value by some 16 times, according to Senator George Aiken (R-VT).
On 5 May 1945, the turned over "Pan Gulf" to the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO) of the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease; FESCO renamed the ship SS "Lermontov" (, ) after the poet Mikhail Lermontov. The Soviets armed the ship with a gun and other weapons and employed the ship in cargo duties in support of the war.
At war's end, "Lermontov" remained with FESCO through 1950. At that time she was transferred to the Black Sea Shipping Company, with which she remained into the 1960s. "Lermontov" was delivered to shipbreakers in Split on 26 June 1966.

South Dakota Highway 40

South Dakota Highway 40 (SD 40) is a state highway in southwest South Dakota. The highway is just over long and runs from U.S. Route 16A (US 16A) in Keystone to Bureau of Indian Affairs Highway 41 in Red Shirt. The highway runs near Mount Rushmore National Memorial in Keystone, and its eastern terminus is on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation near the edge of Badlands National Park. SD 40 was established along its current route in 1976; the SD 40 designation was originally used on a highway that is now part of SD 44.
Route description.
SD 40 begins at an intersection with US 16A in Keystone and heads east through the town. It crosses Battle Creek numerous times, then leaves Keystone and heads in a general southeastern direction, curving regularly. The highway crosses Iron Creek just before leaving the Black Hills National Forest and crossing Battle Creek once more. It continues southeast, leaving Pennington County and entering Custer County. In Custer County, SD 40 meets SD 79, and the two highways run northward toward Hermosa. They straddle the western limit of Hermosa for a short distance before SD 79 continues north and SD 40 splits off to the east, passing through Hermosa. East of town, SD 40 curves back to the southeast and enters the Buffalo Gap National Grassland. Finally, the route curves to the south and crosses the Cheyenne River; doing this, it leaves the Buffalo Gap National Grassland and Custer County, and enters Shannon County and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, becoming Bureau of Indian Affairs Highway 41 (BIA Hwy. 41).
Related route.
South Dakota Highway 40A was a short spur route in the east part of Badlands National Park. This route was originally part of South Dakota Highway 40. At that time, SD 40 exited the park to the northeast, and continued east with U.S. Highway 16. Around 1970, SD 40 was rerouted south from the park to a new alignment south of the White River. When this was done, SD 40A was created to link with Alternate U.S. Highway 16.
In 1976, this route was redesignated as South Dakota Highway 377.
Legal definition.
The route of SD 40 is defined in South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-161. [http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Statute=31-4-161&Type=Statute]

<doc id="19179497" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19179497" title="Mithridates VI of Pontus">
Mithridates VI of Pontus

Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI (), from Old Persian "Mithradatha", "gift of Mithra"; 134–63 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 120–63 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republic’s most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucullus and Pompey. He was also the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus.
Ancestry, family and early life.
Mithridates was a prince of Persian and Greek ancestry. He claimed descent from Cyrus the Great, from the family of Darius the Great, the Regent Antipater and from the generals of Alexander the Great and later kings: Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Seleucus I Nicator. Mithridates was born in the Pontic city of Sinope, and was raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. He was the first son and among the children born to Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus (reigned 150–120 BC). His father, Mithridates V, was a prince and the son of the former Pontic Monarchs Pharnaces I of Pontus and his wife-cousin Nysa. His mother, Laodice VI, was a Seleucid Princess and the daughter of the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus IV Epiphanes and his wife-sister Laodice IV.
Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope, poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. In the will of Mithridates V, he left the Kingdom to the joint rule of Laodice VI, Mithridates and his younger brother, Mithridates Chrestus. Mithridates and his younger brother were both under aged to rule and their mother retained all power as regent. Laodice VI’s regency over Pontus was from 120 BC to 116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC) and favored Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates. During his mother’s regency, he escaped from his mother's plots against him, and went into hiding.
Mithridates emerged from hiding and returned to Pontus between 116 BC and 113 BC and was hailed King. He removed his mother and brother from the throne, imprisoning both, and became the sole ruler of Pontus. Laodice VI died in prison of natural causes. Mithridates Chrestus may have died in prison from natural causes or was tried for treason and executed. Mithridates gave both a royal funeral. Mithridates first married his younger sister Laodice, aged 16. He married her to preserve the purity of their bloodline, and to co-rule over Pontus, to ensure the succession to his legitimate children, and to solidify his claim to the throne.
Early reign.
Mithridates entertained ambitions of making his state the dominant power in the Black Sea and Anatolia. After he subjugated Colchis, the king of Pontus clashed for supremacy in the Pontic steppe with the Scythian King Palacus. The most important centres of Crimea, Tauric Chersonesus and the Bosporan Kingdom readily surrendered their independence in return for Mithridates' promises to protect them against the Scythians, their ancient enemies. After several abortive attempts to invade the Crimea, the Scythians and the allied Rhoxolanoi suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general Diophantus and accepted Mithridates as their overlord.
The young king then turned his attention to Anatolia, where Roman power was on the rise. He contrived to partition Paphlagonia and Galatia with King Nicomedes III of Bithynia. It soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic alliance with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of Cappadocia, and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assistance of Rome. The Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95 – 92 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other than to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war.
Mithridatic Wars.
The next ruler of Bithynia, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, was a figurehead manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his Roman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the Social War, a civil war with its Italian allies. Thus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were only two legions present in Macedonia. These legions combined with Nicomedes IV's army to invade Mithridates' kingdom of Pontus in 89 BC. Mithridates, however, won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces. His victorious forces were welcomed throughout Anatolia. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and Italian settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the Roman presence in the region. This episode is known as the Asiatic Vespers.
The Kingdom of Pontus comprised a mixed population in its Ionian Greek and Anatolian cities. The royal family moved the capital from Amasya to the Greek city of Sinope. Its rulers tried to fully assimilate the potential of their subjects by showing a Greek face to the Greek world and an Iranian/Anatolian face to the Eastern world. Whenever the gap between the rulers and their Anatolian subjects became greater, they would put emphasis on their Persian origins. In this manner, the royal propaganda claimed heritage both from Persian and Greek rulers, including Cyrus the Great, Darius I of Persia, Alexander the Great and Seleucus I Nicator. Mithridates too posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to further his political ambitions; it is no proof that he felt a mission to promote its extension within his domains. Whatever his true intentions, the Greek cities (including Athens) defected to the side of Mithridates and welcomed his armies in mainland Greece, while his fleet besieged the Romans at Rhodes.
Neighboring King of Armenia Tigranes the Great, established an alliance with Mithridates and married one of Mithridates’ daughters, Cleopatra of Pontus. They would support each other in the coming conflict with Rome.
The Romans responded by organising a large invasion force to defeat him and remove him from power.The First Mithridatic War, fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw Lucius Cornelius Sulla force Mithridates VI out of Greece proper. After victory in several battles, Sulla received news of trouble back in Rome posed by his enemy Gaius Marius and hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates. As Sulla returned to Italy Lucius Licinius Murena was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to recoup his forces. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates scored a victory over Murena's green forces before peace was again declared by treaty.
When Rome attempted to annex Bithynia (bequested to Rome by its last king) nearly a decade later, Mithridates VI attacked with an even larger army, leading to the Third Mithridatic War from 73 BC to 63 BC. First Lucullus and then Pompey were sent against Mithridates VI, who surged back to retake his kingdom of Pontus, but was at last defeated by Pompey.
After his defeat by Pompey in 63 BC, Mithridates VI fled with a small army from Colchis (modern Georgia) over the Caucasus Mountains to Crimea and made plans to raise yet another army to take on the Romans. His eldest living son, Machares, viceroy of Cimmerian Bosporus, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares killed, and Mithridates took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom. Mithridates then ordered the conscriptions and preparations for war. In 63 BC, Pharnaces II of Pontus, one of his sons, led a rebellion against his father, joined by Roman exiles in the core of Mithridates' Pontic army. Mithridates withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he committed suicide. Pompey buried Mithridates in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, the old capital of Pontus.
Assassination conspiracy.
During the time of the First Mithridatic War, a group of Mithridates' friends plotted to kill him. These were Mynnio and Philotimus of Smyrna, and Cleisthenes and Asclepiodotus of Lesbos. Asclepiodotus changed his mind and became an informant. He arranged to have Mithridates hide under a couch to hear the plot against him. The other conspirators were tortured and executed. However, this was not enough for Mithridates, who also killed all of the plotters' families and friends.
Propaganda.
Where his ancestors pursued philhellenism as a means of attaining respectability and prestige among the Hellenistic kingdoms, Mithridates VI made use of Hellenism as a political tool. As protector of Greek cities on the Black Sea and in Asia against barbarism, Mithridates VI logically became protector of Greece and Greek culture, and would use this stance in his clashes with Rome. Strabo mentions that Chersonesus buckled under the pressure of the barbarians and asked Mithridates VI to become its protector (7.4.3. c.308). The most impressive symbol of Mithridates VI's approbation with Greece (Athens in particular) appears at Delos: a heroon dedicated to the Pontic king in 102/1 by the Athenian Helianax, a priest of Poseidon Aisios. A dedication at Delos, by Dicaeus, a priest of Sarapis, was made in 94/93 BC on behalf of the Athenians, Romans, and "King Mithridates Eupator Dionysus." Greek styles mixed with Persian elements also abound on official Pontic coins – Perseus was favored as an intermediary between both worlds, East and West.
Certainly influenced by Alexander the Great, Mithridates VI extended his propaganda from "defender" of Greece to the "great liberator" of the Greek world as war with Roman Republic became inevitable. The Romans were easily translated into "barbarians", in the same sense as the Persian Empire during the war with Persia in the first half of the 5th century BC and during Alexander's campaign. How many Greeks genuinely bought into this claim will never be known. It served its purpose, however. At least partially because of it, Mithridates VI was able to fight the First War with Rome on Greek soil, and maintain the allegiance of Greece. His campaign for the allegiance of the Greeks was aided in no small part by his enemy Sulla, who allowed his troops to sack the city of Delphi and plunder many of the city's most famous treasures to help finance his military expenses.
Death.
When Mithridates VI was at last defeated by Pompey and in danger of capture by Rome, he is alleged to have attempted suicide by poison; this attempt failed, however, because of his immunity to the poison. According to Appian's "Roman History", he then requested his Gaul bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword:
Cassius Dio "Roman History", on the other hand, records his death as murder:
At the behest of Pompey, Mithridates' body was later buried alongside his ancestors (in Sinope, Book 37, chapter 14). Mount Mithridat in the central Kerch and the town of Yevpatoria in Crimea commemorate his name.
Mithridates' antidote.
In his youth, after the assassination of his father Mithridates V in 120 BC, Mithridates is said to have lived in the wilderness for seven years, inuring himself to hardship. While there, and after his accession, he cultivated an immunity to poisons by regularly ingesting sub-lethal doses of the same. He invented a complex "universal antidote" against poisoning; several versions are described in the literature. Aulus Cornelius Celsus gives one in his De Medicina and names it "Antidotum Mithridaticum", whence English "mithridate. Pliny the Elder's version comprised 54 ingredients to be placed in a flask and matured for at least two months. After Mithridates' death in 63 BC, many imperial Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve on the original formula, which they touted as Mithradatium. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component; they were supervised by the "Agari", a group of Scythian shamans who never left him. Mithridates was reportedly guarded in his sleep by a horse, a bull, and a stag, which would whinny, bellow, and bleat whenever anyone approached the royal bed.
Mithridates as polyglot.
In Pliny the Elder's account of famous polyglots, Mithridates could speak the languages of all the twenty-two nations he governed. This reputation led to the use of Mithridates' name as title in some later works on comparative linguistics, such as Conrad Gessner's "Mithridates de differentis linguis," (1555), and Adelung and Vater's "Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde" (1806–1817).
Wives, mistresses and children.
Mithridates VI had wives and mistresses, by whom he had various children. The names he gave his children are a representation of his Persian, Greek heritage and of his ancestry.
One of his mistresses was the Galatian Celtic Princess Adobogiona. By Adobogiona, Mithridates had two children: a son called Mithridates I of the Bosporus and a daughter called Adobogiona.
His sons born from his concubine were Cyrus, Xerxes, Darius, Ariarathes IX of Cappadocia, Artaphernes, Oxathres, Phoenix (Mithridates’ son by a mistress of Syrian descent) and Exipodras. His daughters born from his concubine were Nysa, Eupatra, Cleopatra the Younger, Mithridates and Orsabaris. Nysa and Mithridates, were engaged to the Egyptian Greek Pharaohs Ptolemy XII Auletes and his brother Ptolemy of Cyprus.
In 63 BC, when the Kingdom of Pontus was annexed by the Roman general Pompey the remaining sisters, wives, mistresses and children of Mithridates VI in Pontus were put to death. Plutarch writing in his lives (Pompey v.45) states that Mithridates' sister and five of his children took part in Pompey's triumphal procession on this return to Rome in 61 BC.
The Cappadocian Greek nobleman and high priest of the temple-state of Comana, Cappadocia Archelaus had descended from Mithridates VI. He claimed to be a son of Mithridates VI, however chronologically Archelaus may have been a maternal grandson of the Pontic King, who his father was Mithridates VI’s favorite general may have married one of the daughters of Mithridates VI.
Literature.
The poet A. E. Housman alludes to Mithridates' antidote, also known as mithridatism, in the final stanza of his poem in "A Shropshire Lad".
Ralph Waldo Emerson included his "Mithridates" in his 1847 "Poems". The legend also appears in Alexandre Dumas's novel "The Count of Monte Cristo".
The demise of Mithridates VI is detailed in the 1673 play "Mithridate" written by Jean Racine. This play is the basis for several 18th century operas including one of Mozart's earliest, known most commonly by its Italian name, "Mitridate, re di Ponto" (1770).
He is the subject of the opera "Mitridate Eupatore" (1707) by Alessandro Scarlatti. In "The Grass Crown", the second in the "Masters of Rome" series, Colleen McCullough, the Australian writer, describes in detail the various aspects of his life – the murder of Laodice (sister-wife of Mithridates VI of Pontus), and the Roman Consul who, quite alone and surrounded by the Pontic army, ordered Mithridates to leave Cappadocia immediately and go back to Pontus – which he did.
Wordsworth, amidst casting about for poetic themes in "":
In Dorothy L. Sayers' Detective Novel "Strong Poison", from 1929, the protagonist, Lord Peter Wimsey, refers to Mithridates' measures to survive poisoning; as well as Albert Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, when the protagonist warns not to trust someone who looks straight in your eye, as they're trying to distract you from seeing something, "..even the path light travels is bent".
James Joyce alludes to Mithridates' immunity to poison in his love poem "Though I Thy Mithridates Were".
"The Last King" is an historical novel by Michael Curtis Ford about the King and his exploits against the Roman Republic. Mithridates is a major character in Poul Anderson's novel "The Golden Slave."
Mithridates of Pontus is mentioned by E. E. "Doc" Smith in "Triplanetary", the first novel of the famous "Lensman" science fiction series. In the story, Mithridates was supposed to be one of the humans possessed by a member of an evil alien race bent on remaking human civilization into its own image.
In the novel "Mithridates is Dead" (Spanish: "Mitrídates ha muerto"), Ignasi Ribó traces parallels between the historical figures of Mithridates and Osama Bin Laden. Within a postmodern narrative of the making and unmaking of history, Ribó suggests that the September 11 attacks on the United States closely paralleled the massacre of Roman citizens in 88 B.C. and prompted similar consequences, namely the imperialist overstretch of the American and Roman republics respectively. Furthermore, he suggests that the ensuing Mithridatic Wars were one of the key factors in the demise of Rome's republican regime, as well as in the spread of the Christian faith in Asia Minor and eventually throughout the whole Roman Empire. The novel implies that the current events in the world might have similar unforeseen consequences.

Torquatus of Acci

Saint Torquatus () is venerated as the patron saint of Guadix, Spain. Tradition makes him a Christian missionary of the 1st century, during the Apostolic Age. He evangelized the town of "Acci", identified as Guadix, and became its first bishop.
He is one of the group of Seven Apostolic Men ("siete varones apostólicos"), seven Christian clerics ordained in Rome by Saints Peter and Paul and sent to evangelize Spain. Besides Torquatus, this group includes Sts. Hesychius, Caecilius, Ctesiphon, Euphrasius, Indaletius, and Secundius ("Isicio, Cecilio, Tesifonte, Eufrasio, Hesiquio y Segundo").
It is not certain whether Torquatus was a martyr or confessor of the faith.
Veneration.
Torquatus' relics were rediscovered in the 8th century during the Moorish invasion of Spain, in a church built in his honor, near the Limia River.
Torquatus' relics and those of Euphrasius were translated to Galicia. Torquatus’ relics remained for a long time in the Visigothic church of Santa Comba de Bande (Ourense) ("Santa Comba de Baños").
In the 10th century, Torquatus' relics were translated to San Salvador de Celanova (in Celanova, Ourense).
In 1592, the sepulcher at Celanova was opened and part of Torquatus’ relics were distributed to Guadix, Compostela, and Orense, and also to El Escorial, and to the Jesuit college at Guadix, and in 1627, to Granada. The relics that remained in San Salvador de Celanova were placed in the main chapel of the church of the monastery, together with those of Saint Rudesind, the monastery’s founder.
The cathedral of Guadix conserves three relics associated with Saint Torquatus: his arm, his jawbone, and his calcaneus (this last relic is not on display).
It has been theorized that Torquatus, may be a Christian version of the Celtic god Bandua.

<doc id="19179592" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19179592" title="Archaea">
Archaea

The Archaea ( or ; singular "archaeon") are a domain or kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes are prokaryotes, meaning they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells.
Archaea were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (or Kingdom Monera), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life: Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into four recognized phyla. Classification is difficult, because the majority have not been studied in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.
Archaea and bacteria are similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of "Haloquadratum walsbyi". Despite this visual similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: ranging from organic compounds such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no species form spores.
Archaea were viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, but they have been found in a broad range of habitats, including soils, oceans, marshlands and the human colon and navel. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit the human gut and the ruminant gut, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents are exploited in biotechnology.
Classification.
New domain.
For much of the 20th century, prokaryotes were regarded as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. However, a new approach was proposed in 1965, using the sequences of the genes in these organisms to work out how different prokaryotes are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.
Archaea were first classified as a separate group of prokaryotes in 1977 by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and Eubacteria and treated as kingdoms or subkingdoms, which Woese and Fox termed "Urkingdoms". Woese argued that this group of prokaryotes is a fundamentally different sort of life. To emphasize this difference, these two domains were later renamed Archaea and Bacteria. The word "archaea" comes from the Ancient Greek , meaning "ancient things".
The first representatives of the domain Archaea were methanogens. For a long time archaea were seen as extremophiles that only exist in extreme habitats such as hot springs and salt lakes. However, by the end of the 20th century, archaea had been identified in non-extreme environments as well. Today they are known to be a large and diverse group of organisms that are widely distributed in nature and are common in all habitats. This new appreciation of the importance and ubiquity of archaea came from using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect prokaryotes from environmental samples (such as water or soil) by multiplying their ribosomal genes. This allows the detection and identification of organisms that have not been cultured in the laboratory.
Current classification.
The classification of archaea, and of prokaryotes in general, is a rapidly moving and contentious field. Current classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors. These classifications rely heavily on the use of the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes to reveal relationships between organisms (molecular phylogenetics). Most of the culturable and well-investigated species of archaea are members of two main phyla, the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Other groups have been tentatively created. For example, the peculiar species "Nanoarchaeum equitans", which was discovered in 2003, has been given its own phylum, the Nanoarchaeota. A new phylum Korarchaeota has also been proposed. It contains a small group of unusual thermophilic species that shares features of both of the main phyla, but is most closely related to the Crenarchaeota. Other recently detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups, such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms (ARMAN), which were discovered in 2006 and are some of the smallest organisms known.
Species.
The classification of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species as a group of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with each other but not with others) is of no help because archaea reproduce asexually.
Archaea show high levels of horizontal gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus "Ferroplasma". On the other hand, studies in "Halorubrum" found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.
Current knowledge on genetic diversity is fragmentary and the total number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains obscure. The Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization.
Origin and evolution.
Scientific evidence suggests that life began on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago. The earliest evidences for life on Earth are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. 
Although probable prokaryotic cell fossils date to almost 3.5 billion years ago, most prokaryotes do not have distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot be used to identify them as Archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7 billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest sediments, formed 3.8 billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient that exists on Earth.
Woese argued that the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes represent separate lines of descent that diverged early on from an ancestral colony of organisms. One possibility is that this occurred before the evolution of cells, when the lack of a typical cell membrane allowed unrestricted lateral gene transfer, and that the common ancestors of the three domains arose by fixation of specific subsets of genes. It is possible that the last common ancestor of the bacteria and archaea was a thermophile, which raises the possibility that lower temperatures are "extreme environments" in archaeal terms, and organisms that live in cooler environments appeared only later. Since the Archaea and Bacteria are no more related to each other than they are to eukaryotes, the term "prokaryote"'s only surviving meaning is "not a eukaryote", limiting its value.
Comparison to other domains.
The following table describes some major characteristics that are generally shared by Archaea with the other two domains or with neither, to illustrate the relationships to each. Many of these characteristics are also discussed below.
Relationship to other prokaryotes.
The relationship between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which comprise the majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of Gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus of varying chemical composition. In phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of Gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and Gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetase I.
R.S. Gupta has proposed that the archaea evolved from Gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This is suggested by the observation that archaea are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics that are primarily produced by Gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. His proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the Gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion. Gupta's proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that Gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.
Relation to eukaryotes.
The evolutionary relationship between archaea and eukaryotes remains unclear. Aside from the similarities in cell structure and function that are discussed below, many genetic trees group the two.
Complicating factors include claims that the relationship between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as "Thermotoga maritima", from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.
Morphology.
Individual archaea range from 0.1 micrometers (μm) to over 15 μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, commonly as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in "Sulfolobus", needle-like filaments that are less than half a micrometer in diameter in "Thermofilum", and almost perfectly rectangular rods in "Thermoproteus" and "Pyrobaculum". "Haloquadratum walsbyi" are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In "Thermoplasma" and "Ferroplasma" the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.
Some species form aggregates or filaments of cells up to 200 μm long. These organisms can be prominent in biofilms. Notably, aggregates of "Thermococcus coalescens" cells fuse together in culture, forming single giant cells. Archaea in the genus "Pyrodictium" produce an elaborate multicell colony involving arrays of long, thin hollow tubes called "cannulae" that stick out from the cells' surfaces and connect them into a dense bush-like agglomeration. The function of these cannulae is not settled, but they may allow communication or nutrient exchange with neighbors. Multi-species colonies exist, such as the "string-of-pearls" community that was discovered in 2001 in a German swamp. Round whitish colonies of a novel Euryarchaeota species are spaced along thin filaments that can range up to long; these filaments are made of a particular bacteria species.
Structure, composition development, operation.
Archaea and bacteria have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, archaea cell membranes are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using one or more flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to Gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is "Ignicoccus", which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.
Membranes.
Archaeal membranes are made of molecules that differ strongly from those in other life forms, showing that archaea are related only distantly to bacteria and eukaryotes. In all organisms cell membranes are made of molecules known as phospholipids. These molecules possess both a polar part that dissolves in water (the phosphate "head"), and a "greasy" non-polar part that does not (the lipid tail). These dissimilar parts are connected by a glycerol moiety. In water, phospholipids cluster, with the heads facing the water and the tails facing away from it. The major structure in cell membranes is a double layer of these phospholipids, which is called a lipid bilayer.
These phospholipids are unusual in four ways:
Wall and flagella.
Most archaea (but not "Thermoplasma" and "Ferroplasma") possess a cell wall. In most archaea the wall is assembled from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules that cover the outside of the cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid.
Archaea flagella operate like bacterial flagella—their long stalks are driven by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore to the tip of the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.
Metabolism.
Archaea exhibit a great variety of chemical reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, in the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.
Other groups of archaea use sunlight as a source of energy (they are phototrophs). However, oxygen–generating photosynthesis does not occur in any of these organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms of life; for example, archaea use a modified form of glycolysis (the Entner–Doudoroff pathway) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle. These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency.
Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens living in anaerobic environments such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by "acetotrophic" archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are a major part of the communities of microorganisms that produce biogas.
[[File:Bacteriorhodopsin.png|thumb|right|Bacteriorhodopsin from "Halobacterium salinarum". The retinol cofactor and residues involved in proton transfer are shown as ball-and-stick models.]]
Other archaea use in the atmosphere as a source of carbon, in a process called carbon fixation (they are autotrophs). This process involves either a highly modified form of the Calvin cycle or a recently discovered metabolic pathway called the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle. The Crenarchaeota also use the reverse Krebs cycle while the Euryarchaeota also use the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. Carbon–fixation is powered by inorganic energy sources. No known archaea carry out photosynthesis. Archaeal energy sources are extremely diverse, and range from the oxidation of ammonia by the Nitrosopumilales to the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur by species of "Sulfolobus", using either oxygen or metal ions as electron acceptors.
Phototrophic archaea use light to produce chemical energy in the form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a retinol cofactor buried in the center of the protein.
Genetics.
Archaea usually have a single circular chromosome, the size of which may be as great as 5,751,492 base pairs in "Methanosarcina acetivorans", the largest known archaeal genome. One-tenth of this size is the tiny 490,885 base-pair genome of "Nanoarchaeum equitans", the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called "plasmids", are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.
Archaea can be infected by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated to any other form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95 °C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.
Archaea are genetically distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes, with up to 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of the remainder of the unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.
Transcription and translation in archaea resemble these processes in eukaryotes more than in bacteria, with the archaeal RNA polymerase and ribosomes being very close to their equivalents in eukaryotes. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems to be close to that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.
Gene transfer and genetic exchange.
"Halobacterium volcanii", an extreme halophilic archaeon, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction.
When the hyperthermophilic archaea "Sulfolobus solfataricus" and "Sulfolobus acidocaldarius" are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in "S. solfataricus" could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in "S. acidocaldarius". Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between "Sulfolobus" cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.
Reproduction.
Archaea reproduce asexually by binary or multiple fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis does not occur, so if a species of archaea exists in more than one form, all have the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. Details have only been investigated in the genus "Sulfolobus", but that cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes. However, the proteins that direct cell division, such as the protein FtsZ, which forms a contracting ring around the cell, and the components of the septum that is constructed across the center of the cell, are similar to their bacterial equivalents.
Both bacteria and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that are resistant to osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, but these are not reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.
Ecology.
Habitats.
Archaea exist in a broad range of habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may contribute up to 20% of earth's biomass. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in marshland, sewage, the oceans, and soils.
Extremophile archaea are members of four main physiological groups. These are the halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles. These groups are not comprehensive or phylum-specific, nor are they mutually exclusive, since some archaea belong to several groups. Nonetheless, they are a useful starting point for classification.
Halophiles, including the genus "Halobacterium", live in extremely saline environments such as salt lakes and outnumber their bacterial counterparts at salinities greater than 20–25%. Thermophiles grow best at temperatures above , in places such as hot springs; "hyperthermophilic" archaea grow optimally at temperatures greater than . The archaeal "Methanopyrus kandleri" Strain 116 can even reproduce at , the highest recorded temperature of any organism.
Other archaea exist in very acidic or alkaline conditions. For example, one of the most extreme archaean acidophiles is "Picrophilus torridus", which grows at pH 0, which is equivalent to thriving in 1.2 molar sulfuric acid.
This resistance to extreme environments has made archaea the focus of speculation about the possible properties of extraterrestrial life. Some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar to those on Mars, leading to the suggestion that viable microbes could be transferred between planets in meteorites.
Recently, several studies have shown that archaea exist not only in mesophilic and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom.
Role in chemical cycling.
Archaea recycle elements such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur through their various habitats. Although these activities are vital for normal ecosystem function, archaea can also contribute to human-made changes, and even cause pollution.
Archaea carry out many steps in the nitrogen cycle. This includes both reactions that remove nitrogen from ecosystems, such as nitrate-based respiration and denitrification, as well as processes that introduce nitrogen, such as nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation. Archaean involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions was recently discovered. These reactions are particularly important in the oceans. The archaea also appear to be crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce nitrite, which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.
In the sulfur cycle, archaea that grow by oxidizing sulfur compounds release this element from rocks, making it available to other organisms. However, the archaea that do this, such as "Sulfolobus", produce sulfuric acid as a waste product, and the growth of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to acid mine drainage and other environmental damage.
In the carbon cycle, methanogen archaea remove hydrogen and are important in the decay of organic matter by the populations of microorganisms that act as decomposers in anaerobic ecosystems, such as sediments, marshes and sewage treatment works. However, methane is one of the most abundant greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere, constituting 18% of the global total. It is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Methanogens are the primary source of atmospheric methane, and are responsible for most of the world's yearly methane emissions. As a consequence, these archaea contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.
Interactions with other organisms.
The well-characterized interactions between archaea and other organisms are either mutual or commensal. There are no clear examples of known archaeal pathogens or parasites. However, a relationship has been proposed between some species of methanogens and infections in the mouth, and "Nanoarchaeum equitans" may be a parasite of another species of archaea, since it only survives and reproduces within the cells of the Crenarchaeon "Ignicoccus hospitalis", and appears to offer no benefit to its host. In contrast, Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms (ARMAN) occasionally connect with other archaeal cells in acid mine drainage biofilms. The nature of this relationship is unknown. However, it is distinct from that of "Nanarchaeaum–Ignicoccus" in that the ultrasmall ARMAN cells are usually seen independent of the Thermoplasmatales cells.
Mutualism.
One well-understood example of mutualism is the interaction between protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.
In anaerobic protozoa such as "Plagiopyla frontata", archaea reside inside the protozoa and consume hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. Archaea also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean "Cenarchaeum symbiosum" lives within (is an endosymbiont of) the sponge "Axinella mexicana".
Commensalism.
Archaea can also be commensals, benefiting from an association without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen "Methanobrevibacter smithii" is by far the most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).
Significance in technology and industry.
Extremophile archaea, particularly those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity, are a source of enzymes that function under these harsh conditions. These enzymes have found many uses. For example, thermostable DNA polymerases, such as the Pfu DNA polymerase from "Pyrococcus furiosus", revolutionized molecular biology by allowing the polymerase chain reaction to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for cloning DNA. In industry, amylases, galactosidases and pullulanases in other species of "Pyrococcus" that function at over allow food processing at high temperatures, such as the production of low lactose milk and whey. Enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents, allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds. This stability makes them easier to use in structural biology. Consequently the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies.
In contrast to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, the use of the organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of sewage treatment, since they are part of the community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.
Archaea host a new class of potentially useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within "Haloarchaea" and "Sulfolobus".These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the creation of new selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.

Abiogenesis

Abiogenesis ( ) or biopoiesis is the natural process by which life arose from non-living matter such as simple organic compounds. The earliest life on Earth existed at least 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era when sufficient crust had solidified following the molten Hadean Eon. The earliest specific evidence for life on Earth is biogenic graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.
Scientific hypotheses about the origins of life can be divided into a number of categories. Many approaches investigate how self-replicating molecules or their components came into existence. On the assumption that life originated spontaneously on Earth, the Miller–Urey experiment and similar experiments demonstrated that most amino acids, often called "the building blocks of life", can be racemically synthesized in conditions intended to be similar to those of the early Earth. Several mechanisms have been investigated, including lightning and radiation. Other approaches ("metabolism first" hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems in the early Earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for self-replication.
Conceptual history.
Spontaneous generation.
Belief in the present ongoing spontaneous generation of certain forms of life from non-living matter goes back to Aristotle and ancient Greek philosophy and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century. This belief was paired with a belief in heterogenesis, "i.e.", that one form of life derived from a different form ("e.g." bees from flowers). Classical notions of spontaneous generation, which can be considered under the modern term abiogenesis, held that certain complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants, flies from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting logs at the bottom of bodies of water, and so on.
In the 17th century, such assumptions started to be questioned. In 1646, Sir Thomas Browne published his "Pseudodoxia Epidemica" (subtitled "Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and Commonly Presumed Truths"), which was an attack on false beliefs and "vulgar errors." His conclusions were not widely accepted at the time. His contemporary, Alexander Ross wrote: "To question this (i.e., spontaneous generation) is to question reason, sense and experience. If he doubts of this let him go to Egypt, and there he will find the fields swarming with mice, begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants."
In 1665, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism. Hooke was followed in 1676 by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been protozoa and bacteria. Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for sexual reproduction, and asexual reproduction through cell division had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from putrefaction, and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction, by the 1680s he became convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.
The first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when Francesco Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be biogenesis: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing ("omne vivum ex ovo", Latin for "every living thing from an egg").
In 1768, Lazzaro Spallanzani demonstrated that microbes were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. In 1861, Louis Pasteur performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but only invade them from outside.
Pasteur and Darwin.
By the middle of the 19th century, the theory of biogenesis had accumulated so much evidential support, due to the work of Louis Pasteur and others, that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. Pasteur himself remarked, after a definitive finding in 1864, "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."
In a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker on February 1, 1871, Charles Darwin addressed the question, suggesting that the original spark of life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. present, so that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes". He went on to explain that "at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." In other words, the presence of life itself makes the search for the spontaneous origin of life dependent on the artificial production of organic compounds in the sterile conditions of the laboratory.
"Primordial soup" hypothesis.
No new notable research or theory on the subject appeared until 1924, when Alexander Oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his "The Origin of Life", Oparin proposed that the "spontaneous generation of life" that had been attacked by Louis Pasteur did in fact occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early Earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. Oparin argued that a "primeval soup" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of sunlight. These would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed coacervate droplets. These droplets would "grow" by fusion with other droplets, and "reproduce" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive metabolism in which those factors which promote "cell integrity" survive, and those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.
Around the same time, J. B. S. Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans—different from their modern counterparts—would have formed a "hot dilute soup" in which organic compounds could have formed. J.D. Bernal, a pioneer in x-ray crystallography, called this idea "biopoiesis" or "biopoesis", the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but nonliving molecules, and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages.
One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the "soup" theory came in 1952. A graduate student, Stanley Miller, and his professor, Harold Urey, performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors, under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis. The now-famous "Miller–Urey experiment" used a highly reduced mixture of gases—methane, ammonia and hydrogen—to form basic organic monomers, such as amino acids. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the "soup" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centers. In the Miller–Urey experiment, a mixture of water, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. After one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was now in the form of a racemic mixture of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.
The underlying hypothesis held by Oparin, Haldane, Bernal, Miller and Urey was that conditions on the primeval Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized complex organic compounds from simple precursors. A recent reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. One of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found.
Complex biological molecules and protocells.
Microspheres or protenoids.
In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, Sidney W. Fox in the 1950s and 1960s, studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. He demonstrated that amino acids could spontaneously form small peptides. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic polypeptide molecules now named "proteinoids microspheres", which show many of the basic characteristics of 'life'.
In another experiment using a similar method to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a cinder cone in Hawaii. He discovered that the temperature was over just beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash and into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water a thick, brown liquid leached out. It turned out that the amino acids had combined to form proteinoids, and the proteinoids had combined to form small, cell-like spheres. Fox called these "microspheres", a name that subsequently was displaced by the more informative term "protobionts". His protobionts were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of cyanobacteria. They contained no functional nucleic acids, but split asexually and formed within double membranes that had some attributes suggestive of cell membranes. Based upon such experiments, Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh stated in December 1967 that "laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years," a remark that reflected the typical contemporary levels of innocence of the complexity of cell structures.
Jeewanu.
About the same time as Fox's microspheres, synthesis of very similar microscopic particles called Jeewanu (Sanskrit for the "particles of life") was reported by Krishna Bahadur and his team from Allahabad University in India. The first synthesis was in 1963, and followed by a series of reports in 1964. Their experiment involved a photochemical reaction of a mixture of inorganic nitrogenous compounds (such as ammonium phosphate and ammonium molybdate), organic compounds (such as formaldehyde), and minerals commonly found in living cells, in a sterile environment. Under the sunlight, the reaction produced particles surrounded by semipermeable membranes. Unlike the microspheres, the particles contained a complex mixture of organic compounds, including amino acids, phospholipids and carbohydrates. They also showed metabolic activities and an ability to divide.
Early conditions.
The Hadean Earth is thought to have had a secondary atmosphere, formed through degassing of the rocks that accumulated from planetesimal impactors. At first it was thought by scientists like Harold Urey that the earth's atmosphere was made up of hydrides—methane, ammonia and water vapour, and that life began under such reducing conditions, conducive to the formation of organic molecules. However, it is now thought that the early atmosphere, based on today's volcanic evidence, would have contained 60% hydrogen, 20% oxygen (mostly in the form of water vapour), 10% carbon dioxide, 5 to 7% hydrogen sulfide, and smaller amounts of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, free hydrogen, methane and inert gases. As Earth lacked the gravity to hold any molecular hydrogen, this component of the atmosphere was rapidly lost during the Hadean period. Solution of the carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly acidic, with a pH of about 5.5.
Morse and MacKenzie have suggested that oceans may have appeared first in the Hadean eon, as soon as two hundred million years (200 Ma) after the Earth was formed, in a hot reducing environment, and that the pH of about 5.8 rose rapidly towards neutral. This has been supported by Wilde who has pushed the date of the zircon crystals found in the metamorphosed quartzite of Mount Narryer in Western Australia, previously thought to be 4.1–4.2 Ga, to 4.404 Ga. This means that oceans and continental crust existed within 150 Ma of Earth's formation. Rosing et al., suggest that between 4.4 and 4.3 Ga, the Earth was a water world, with little if any continental crust, with an extremely turbulent atmosphere and a hydrosphere subject to high UV, from a T Tauri sun and cosmic radiation and continued bolide impact.
As a result, the Hadean environment was one highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilise the planet and vaporise the ocean within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapour leading to high altitude clouds completely covering the planet. After a few months the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.
Between 3.8 and 4.1 Ga, changes in the orbits of the gaseous giant planets may have caused a late heavy bombardment that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically the Hadean Earth would have been far more active than at any other time in its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17×105 years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250×109 years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common, with the result that. Coupled with internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle generated a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result that there would have been many more smaller very active tectonic plates, than in modern times.
By examining the time interval between such devastating environmental events, the time interval when life might first have come into existence can be found for different early environments. The study by Maher and Stevenson shows that if the deep marine hydrothermal setting provides a suitable site for the origin of life, abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0 to 4.2 Ga, whereas if it occurred at the surface of the Earth abiogenesis could only have occurred between 3.7 and 4.0 Ga.
Other research suggests a colder start to life. Work by Leslie Orgel and colleagues on the synthesis of purines has shown that freezing temperatures are advantageous, due to the concentrating effect for key precursors such as hydrogen cyanide.
Research by Stanley Miller and colleagues suggested that while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for synthesis, cytosine and uracil may require boiling temperatures. Research by the Miller group notes the formation of seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 1972 to 1997. This article also describes research by Christof Biebricher showing the formation of RNA molecules 400 bases long under freezing conditions using an RNA template, a single-strand chain of RNA that guides the formation of a new strand of RNA. As that new RNA strand grows, it adheres to the template. The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing. As an ice crystal forms, it stays pure: only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded. These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often.
Evidence of the early appearance of life comes from the Isua supercrustal belt in Western Greenland and from similar formations in the nearby Akilia Island. Carbon entering into rock formations has a ratio of carbon-13 (13C) to carbon-12 (12C) of about −5.5 (in units of δ13C), where because of a preferential biotic uptake of 12C, biomass has a δ13C of between −20 and −30. These isotopic fingerprints are preserved in the sediments, and Mojzis has used this technique to suggest that life existed on the planet already by 3.85 billion years ago. Lazcano and Miller (1994) suggest that the rapidity of the evolution of life is dictated by the rate of recirculating water through mid-ocean submarine vents. Complete recirculation takes 10 million years, thus any organic compounds produced by then would be altered or destroyed by temperatures exceeding . They estimate that the development of a 100 kilobase genome of a DNA/protein primitive heterotroph into a 7000 gene filamentous cyanobacterium would have required only 7 Ma. Chemist Christian de Duve argues that the determination of chemistry means that "life has to emerge quickly ... Chemical reactions happen quickly or not at all; if any reaction takes a millennium to complete then the chances are all the reagents will simply dissipate or break down in the meantime, unless they are replenished by other faster reactions".
Current models.
There is still no "standard model" of the origin of life. Most currently accepted models draw at least some elements from the framework laid out by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. Under that umbrella, however, are a wide array of disparate discoveries and conjectures such as the following, listed in a rough order of postulated emergence:
No one has yet synthesized a "protocell" using basic components which would have the necessary properties of life (the so-called ""bottom-up-approach""). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to be focused on chemosynthesis of polymers. However, some researchers are working in this field, notably Steen Rasmussen at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Jack Szostak at Harvard University. Others have argued that a ""top-down approach"" is more feasible. One such approach, successfully attempted by Craig Venter and others at The Institute for Genomic Research, involves engineering existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer genes, attempting to discern at which point the most minimal requirements for life were reached.
The biologist John Desmond Bernal coined the term "biopoiesis" for this process, and suggested that there were a number of clearly defined "stages" that could be recognised in explaining the origin of life.
Bernal suggested that evolution commenced between Stage 1 and 2. Such in-vitro evolution of pre-biological polymer catalysts, has been demonstrated by Hiroaki Suga of the University of Buffalo, and supports, he suggests, the RNA World model of abiogenesis (see below).
Origin of organic molecules.
There are two possible sources of organic molecules on the early Earth:
Recently, estimates of these sources suggest that the heavy bombardment before 3.5 Ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by other energy sources.
"Soup" theory.
Biochemist Robert Shapiro has summarized the "primordial soup" theory of Oparin and Haldane in its "mature form" as follows:
While steps 1-3 have been basically observed experimentally, step 4 has been criticised as simplistic - a stage of "then magic happens".
Reducing atmosphere.
At the time of the Miller–Urey experiment, scientific consensus was that the early earth had a reducing atmosphere with compounds relatively rich in hydrogen and poor in oxygen (e.g., and as opposed to and ). However, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as either weakly reducing or neutral (see also Oxygen catastrophe). Such an atmosphere would diminish both the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced, although recent studies that include iron and carbonate minerals (thought to be present in early oceans) in the experimental conditions have again produced a diverse array of amino acids. Other scientific research has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea thermal vents.
Monomer formation.
Apart from the Miller–Urey experiment, the next most important step in research on prebiotic organic synthesis was the demonstration by Joan Oró that the nucleic acid purine base, adenine, was formed by heating aqueous ammonium cyanide solutions. In support of abiogenesis in eutectic ice, more recent work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source).
Monomer accumulation.
The "soup" theory relies on the assumption proposed by Darwin that in an environment with no pre-existing life, organic molecules may have accumulated and provided an environment for chemical evolution.
Further transformation.
The spontaneous formation of complex polymers from abiotically generated monomers under the conditions posited by the "soup" theory is not at all a straightforward process. Besides the necessary basic organic monomers, compounds that would have prohibited the formation of polymers were formed in high concentration during the Miller–Urey and Oró experiments. The Miller experiment, for example, produces many substances that would undergo cross-reactions with the amino acids or terminate the peptide chain.
More fundamentally, it can be argued that the most crucial challenge unanswered by this theory is how the relatively simple organic building blocks polymerise and form more complex structures, interacting in consistent ways to form a protocell. For example, in an aqueous environment hydrolysis of oligomers/polymers into their constituent monomers would be favored over the condensation of individual monomers into polymers.
Eigen's hypothesis.
In the early 1970s, the problem of the origin of life was approached by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. They examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating hypercycle in a prebiotic soup.
In a hypercycle, the information storing system (possibly RNA) produces an enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create quasispecies, which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery that RNA, in certain circumstances, forms itself into ribozymes, capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. However, these reactions are limited to self-excisions (in which a longer RNA molecule becomes shorter), and much rarer small additions that are incapable of coding for any useful protein. The hypercycle theory is further degraded since the hypothetical RNA would require the existence of complex biochemicals such as nucleotides which are not formed under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.
Sol Spiegelman aimed to find the simplest life form by taking advantage of evolution's natural selection process. His new life form, Spiegelman's Monster, had a genome with just 218 bases. Manfred Eigen built on Spiegelman's work and produced a life form with just 48 or 54 nucleotides. M. Sumper and R. Luce of Eigen's laboratory accidentally discovered that a mixture containing no RNA at all but only RNA bases and Q-Beta Replicase can, under the right conditions, spontaneously generate self-replicating RNA which evolves into a form similar to Spiegelman's Monster.
Hoffmann's contributions.
Geoffrey W. Hoffmann, a student of Eigen, contributed to the concept of life involving both replication and metabolism emerging from catalytic noise. His contributions included showing that an early sloppy translation machinery can be stable against an error catastrophe of the type that had been envisaged as problematical by Leslie Orgel ("Orgel's paradox") and calculations regarding the occurrence of a set of required catalytic activities together with the exclusion of catalytic activities that would be disruptive. This is called the stochastic theory of the origin of life.
Wächtershäuser's hypothesis.
Another possible answer to this polymerization conundrum was provided in the 1980s by the German chemist Günter Wächtershäuser, encouraged and supported by Karl R. Popper, in his iron–sulfur world theory. In this theory, he postulated the evolution of (bio)chemical pathways as fundamentals of the evolution of life. Moreover, he presented a consistent system of tracing today's biochemistry back to ancestral reactions that provide alternative pathways to the synthesis of organic building blocks from simple gaseous compounds.
In contrast to the classical Miller experiments, which depend on external sources of energy (such as simulated lightning or ultraviolet irradiation), "Wächtershäuser systems" come with a built-in source of energy, sulfides of iron and other minerals (e.g. pyrite). The energy released from redox reactions of these metal sulfides is not only available for the synthesis of organic molecules, but also for the formation of oligomers and polymers. It is therefore hypothesized that such systems may be able to evolve into autocatalytic sets of self-replicating, metabolically active entities that would predate the life forms known today.
The experiment produced a relatively small yield of dipeptides (0.4% to 12.4%) and a smaller yield of tripeptides (0.10%) but the authors also noted that: "under these same conditions dipeptides hydrolysed rapidly."
Zn-World hypothesis.
The Zn-World (zinc world) theory of Armen Mulkidjanian is an extension of Wächtershäuser's pyrite hypothesis. Wächtershäuser based his theory of the initial chemical processes leading to informational molecules (i.e. RNA, peptides) on a regular mesh of electric charges at the surface of pyrite that may have made the primeval polymerization thermodynamically more favourable by attracting reactants and arranging them appropriately relative to each other. The Zn-World theory specifies and differentiates further. Hydrothermal fluids rich in H2S interacting with cold primordial ocean (or "Darwin pond") water leads to the precipitation of metal sulfide particles. Oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometers in diameter and date back to the Archean eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), and sphalerite (ZnS), with additions of galena (PbS) and alabandite (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. provided by UV light. Since during the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (>100 bar) to precipitate ZnS near the earth's surface and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now, the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.
The Zn-World theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before Archea, Eubacteria and Proto-Eukarya evolved. Archibald Maccallum noted the resemblance of organismal fluids such as blood, lymph to seawater; however, the inorganic composition of all cells differ from that of modern sea water, which led Mulkidjanian and colleagues to reconstruct the "hatcheries" of the first cells combining geochemical analysis with phylogenomic scrutiny of the inorganic ion requirements of universal components of modern cells. The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and phosphate. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapor-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the anoxic, CO2-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. Therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow "Darwin-ponds" lined with porous silicate minerals mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K+, Zn2+, and phosphorus compounds.
Radioactive beach hypothesis.
Zachary Adam at the University of Washington, Seattle, claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of uranium and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life's building blocks. According to computer models reported in "Astrobiology", a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same self-sustaining nuclear reaction as that found in the Oklo uranium ore seam in Gabon. Such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from acetonitrile in water. Radioactive monazite also have released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically "accessible". Thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to Adam. Radioactive actinides, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of organo-metallic complexes. These complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes.
John Parnell of the University of Aberdeen has suggested that such a process could provide part of the "crucible of life" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. As the early Earth is believed to have had many smaller "platelets" it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.
Ultraviolet and temperature-assisted replication model.
From a thermodynamic perspective of the origin of life springs the ultraviolet and temperature-assisted replication (UVTAR) model. Karo Michaelian of the National Autonomous University of Mexico points out that any model for the origin of life must take into account the fact that life is an irreversible thermodynamic process which arises and persists because it produces entropy. Entropy production is not incidental to the process of life, but rather the fundamental reason for its existence. Present day life augments the entropy production of Earth by catalysing the water cycle through evapotranspiration.
Michaelian argues that if the thermodynamic function of life today is to produce entropy through coupling with the water cycle, then this probably was its function at its very beginnings. It turns out that both RNA and DNA when in water solution are very strong absorbers and extremely rapid dissipaters of ultraviolet light within the 200–300 nm wavelength range, which is that part of the sun's spectrum that could have penetrated the dense prebiotic atmosphere. Cnossen et al.
have shown that the amount of ultraviolet (UV) light reaching the Earth's surface in the Archean eon could have been up to 31 orders of magnitude greater than it is today at 260 nm where RNA and DNA absorb most strongly. Absorption and dissipation of UV light by the organic molecules at the Archean ocean surface would have significantly increased the temperature of the surface skin layer and led to enhanced evaporation and thus to have augmented the primitive water cycle. Since absorption and dissipation of high energy photons is an entropy producing process, Michaelian argues that non-equilbrium abiogenic synthesis of RNA and DNA utilizing UV light would have been thermodynamically favored.
A simple mechanism that could explain the replication of RNA and DNA without resort to the use of enzymes could also be provided within the same thermodynamic framework by assuming that life arose when the temperature of the primitive seas had cooled to somewhat below the denaturing temperature of RNA or DNA (based on the ratio of 18O/16O found in cherts of the Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa of about 3.5 to 3.2 Ga., surface temperatures are predicted to have been around 70±15 °C, close to RNA or DNA denaturing temperatures). During the night, the surface water temperature would drop below the denaturing temperature and single strand RNA/DNA could act as a template for the formation of double strand RNA/DNA. During the daylight hours, RNA and DNA would absorb UV light and convert this directly to heat the ocean surface, thereby raising the local temperature enough to allow for denaturing of RNA and DNA. The copying process would have been repeated with each diurnal cycle. 
Such a temperature assisted mechanism of replication bears similarity to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a routine laboratory procedure employed to multiply DNA segments. Michaelian suggests that the traditional origin of life research, that expects to describe the emergence of life from near-equilibrium conditions, is erroneous and that non-equilibrium conditions must be considered, in particular, the importance of entropy production to the emergence of life.
Since denaturation would be most probable in the late afternoon when the Archean sea surface temperature would be highest, and since late afternoon submarine sunlight is somewhat circularly polarized, the homochirality of the organic molecules of life can also be explained within the proposed thermodynamic framework.
Models to explain homochirality.
Some process in chemical evolution must account for the origin of homochirality, i.e. all building blocks in living organisms having the same "handedness" (amino acids being left-handed, nucleic acid sugars (ribose and deoxyribose) being right-handed, and chiral phosphoglycerides). Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral catalyst, they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both enantiomers. This is called a racemic mixture. Clark has suggested that homochirality may have started in space, as the studies of the amino acids on the Murchison meteorite showed L-alanine to be more than twice as frequent as its D form, and L-glutamic acid was more than 3 times prevalent than its D counterpart. It is suggested that polarised light has the power to destroy one enantiomer within the proto-planetary disk. Noyes showed that beta decay caused the breakdown of D-leucine, in a racemic mixture, and that the presence of 14C, present in larger amounts in organic chemicals in the early Earth environment, could have been the cause. Robert M. Hazen reports upon experiments conducted in which various chiral crystal surfaces act as sites for possible concentration and assembly of chiral monomer units into macromolecules. Once established, chirality would be selected for. A small enantiomeric excess can be amplified into a large one by an autocatalytic reaction such as the Soai reaction. Work with organic compounds found on meteorites tends to suggest that chirality is a characteristic of abiogenic synthesis, as amino acids show a left-handed bias, whereas sugars show a predominantly right-handed bias.
Self-organization and replication.
While features of self-organization and self-replication are often considered the hallmark of living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. For example Martin and Russell show that physical compartmentation by cell membranes from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things, and they argue therefore that inorganic matter with such attributes would be life's most likely last common ancestor. Later Palasek showed that self-assembly of RNA molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents.
Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.
From organic molecules to protocells.
The question "How do simple organic molecules form a protocell?" is largely unanswered but there are many hypotheses. Some of these postulate the early appearance of nucleic acids ("genes-first") whereas others postulate the evolution of biochemical reactions and pathways first ("metabolism-first"). Recently, trends are emerging to create hybrid models that combine aspects of both.
Researcher Martin Hanczyc supports the idea of a gradient between life and non-life (i.e. there is no simple line between the two). He thinks that building simple protocells, in the lab, is one of the first steps towards understanding more complex cells, including those that may have later evolved into complex life. Hanczyc says that living cells often consist of somewhere around 1,000,000 types of molecules, whereas his labs are first aiming at creating lifelike systems using around 10 molecules. His protocells display behaviors even simpler than those displayed by things like viruses (e.g. only basic motion, dividing and combining cell walls, and so on). These lifelike behaviors are visible in the short film Protocell Circus by Rachel Armstrong and Michael Simon Toon.
Deep sea vent hypothesis.
The deep sea vent, or alkaline hydrothermal vent, theory for the origin of life on Earth posits that life may have begun at submarine hydrothermal vents, where hydrogen-rich fluids emerge from below the sea floor, as a result of serpentization of ultra mafic olivine with sea water and a pH interface with carbon dioxide-rich ocean water. Sustained chemical energy in such systems is derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors, such as molecular hydrogen, react with electron acceptors, such as carbon dioxide (see iron-sulfur world theory). These are highly exothermic reactions.
Reaction 1a: Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen"
Reaction 1b: "Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentine"
Reaction 1c: "Forsterite + water → serpentine + brucite"
Reaction 1c describes the hydration of olivine with water only to yield serpentine and Mg(OH)2 (brucite). Serpentine is stable at high pH in the presence of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, (C-S-H) phases formed along with portlandite (Ca(OH)2) in hardened Portland cement paste after the hydration of belite (Ca2SiO4), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite.
Analogy of reaction 1c with belite hydration in ordinary Portland cement:<br>
"Belite + water → C-S-H phase + portlandite"
Mike Russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic proton-motive force chemiosmotic gradient, in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. Their microscopic compartments "provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules", composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as mackinawite, endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by Günter Wächtershäuser. This movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:
These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an electrochemical gradient, providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. The proton-motive force (PMF) can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential). In 1978, for the discovery of the PMF, Peter Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Nobel laureate Szostak suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water as well as cactus juice, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains bicarbonate and calcium ions has the most optimal range. This is similar case as the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9-11 and is possible to have the reactions in sea water. According to Nobel winner Melvin Calvin, certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with pH 9-11 at a later evolutionary stage. Some of these compounds like hydrocyanic acid (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. In 2013 Ignatov and Mosin made an analysis of a jellyfish. This analysis also showed that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. This is the environment in which the stromatolites have been created. David Ward described the formation of stromatolites in hot mineral water at the Yellowstone National Park. Stromatolites have lived in hot mineral water and in proximity to areas with volcanic activity. In 2011 Marie-Laure Pons explored the oldest rocks on the planet containing serpentine. French scientists demonstrated that water was rich in carbonates. Processes have evolved in the sea near geysers of hot mineral water. In 2011 Tadashi Sugawara created a protocell in hot water. 
Coenzyme world.
Recent studies, applying the equivalent of Moore's Law to biological evolution and extrapolating backwards, propose that life began " billion years ago", billions of years before the Earth was formed. In the case of evolution, empirical evidence suggested a doubling of complexity every 376 million years. As the age of trees can be measured by the number of rings, the hypothesis that the age of life could be measured by biological complexity (i.e., the length of functional non-redundant DNA in the genome) was studied. If log-transformed complexity is plotted against the time of origin of large evolutionary lineages, then the points fit to a straight line (see figure). The exponential increase in complexity can be explained by a positive self-activating feed back loop. The regression line hits zero (i.e., one nucleotide) at " billion years ago". If this model is correct, and since our Solar System is 4.6 billion years old, then life somehow arrived to Earth from older stellar systems. This hypothesis was criticized by Eugene Koonin who suggested that the rates of early biological evolution might have been much faster due to the absence of competition on early Earth. Chris Adami argued that "it is inconceivable that life began with just a few nucleotides" (see discussion). To answer this criticism, Sharov proposed a hypothetical abiogenesis scenario that starts from coenzyme-like molecules that are functionally equivalent to single nucleotides.
RNA world.
The RNA world hypothesis describes an early Earth with self-replicating and catalytic RNA but no DNA or proteins. This has spurred scientists to try to determine if RNA molecules could have spontaneously formed that were capable of catalyzing their own replication. Evidences suggest chemical conditions (including the presence of boron, molybdenum and oxygen) for initially producing RNA molecules may have been better on the planet Mars than those on the planet Earth. If so, life-suitable molecules, originating on Mars, may have later migrated to Earth via panspermia or similar process.
A number of hypotheses of modes of formation have been put forward. Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein-like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration in aqueous solution. These are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possibilities include systems of chemical reactions that take place within clay substrates or on the surface of pyrite rocks. Factors supportive of an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been artificially produced in labs, which are capable of replication. Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. Jack Szostak has shown that certain catalytic RNAs can, indeed, join smaller RNA sequences together, creating the potential, in the right conditions for self-replication. If these conditions were present, Darwinian selection would favour the proliferation of such self-catalysing structures, to which further functionalities could be added. Lincoln and Joyce have identified an RNA enzyme capable of self-sustained replication.
Researchers have pointed out difficulties for the abiotic synthesis of nucleotides from cytosine and uracil. Cytosine has a half-life of 19 days at and 17,000 years in freezing water. Larralde et al., say that "the generally accepted prebiotic synthesis of ribose, the formose reaction, yields numerous sugars without any selectivity." and they conclude that their "results suggest that the backbone of the first genetic material could not have contained ribose or other sugars because of their instability." The ester linkage of ribose and phosphoric acid in RNA is known to be prone to hydrolysis.
A slightly different version of the RNA-world hypothesis is that a different type of nucleic acid, such as PNA, TNA or GNA, was the first one to emerge as a self-reproducing molecule, to be replaced by RNA only later. Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesised by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by going against the dogma that nitrogenous and oxygenous chemistries should be avoided. In a series of publications, The Sutherland Group at the School of Chemistry, University of Manchester have demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This can be viewed as a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallised out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. Ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine ribonucleotide. Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerise into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates. James Ferris's studies have shown that clay minerals of montmorillonite will catalyze the formation of RNA in aqueous solution, by joining activated mono RNA nucleotides to join together to form longer chains. Although these chains have random sequences, the possibility that one sequence began to non-randomly increase its frequency by increasing the speed of its catalysis is possible to "kick start" biochemical evolution.
"Life" can be considered to have emerged when RNA chains began to express the basic conditions necessary for natural selection to operate as conceived by Darwin: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. Fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (in the sense that they were determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities may have been (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would be encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences. Competitive success among different replicators would have depended on the relative values of these adaptive capacities.
"Metabolism first" models.
Several models reject the idea of the self-replication of a "naked-gene" and postulate the emergence of a primitive metabolism which could provide an environment for the later emergence of RNA replication. The centrality of the Krebs cycle to energy production in aerobic organisms, and in drawing in carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions in biosynthesis of complex organic chemicals, including amino acids and nucleotides, suggests that it was one of the first parts of the metabolism to evolve. Harold J. Morowitz concludes that given sufficient concentrations of ingredients the cycle will "spin" of its own, as the concentration of each intermediate rises, it tends to convert into the next intermediate spontaneously. It thus appears to be in origin, not a creation of the genes, but the product of thermodynamics and chemistry alone. Somewhat in agreement with these notions, geochemist Mike Russell has proposed that "the purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide" (as part of a "metabolism-first", rather than a "genetics-first", scenario). Physicist Jeremy England of MIT has recently proposed thermodynamically, life was bound to eventually arrive, as based on established physics, he mathematically indicates "that when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy (like the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy. This could mean that under certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life.".
Iron-sulfur world.
One of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with Alexander Oparin's notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of DNA. More recent variants in the 1980s and 1990s include Günter Wächtershäuser's iron-sulfur world theory and models introduced by Christian de Duve based on the chemistry of thioesters. More abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by Freeman Dyson in the early 1980s and Stuart Kauffman's notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later in that decade.
However, the idea that a closed metabolic cycle, such as the reductive citric acid cycle, could form spontaneously (proposed by Günter Wächtershäuser) remains debated. In an article entitled "Self-Organizing Biochemical Cycles", the late Leslie Orgel summarized his analysis of the proposal by stating, "There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS2 or some other mineral." It is possible that another type of metabolic pathway was used at the beginning of life. For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the "open" acetyl-CoA pathway (another one of the five recognised ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organisation on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centers and catalyses the formation of acetyl-CoA (which may be regarded as a modern form of acetyl-thiol) in a single step.
Thermosynthesis world.
Today's bioenergetic process of fermentation is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the Acetyl-CoA pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial iron-sulfur world. In a different approach, the Thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of chemiosmosis, which plays an essential role in cellular respiration and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: in Anthonie Muller's "thermosynthesis world" the ATP Synthase enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process.
First life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the phosphodiester bonds of RNA. In a generalization and thermal variation of the binding change mechanism of today's ATP Synthase, the "First Protein" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, RNA 'monomers') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until after a temperature change it was released by thermal unfolding.
The energy source of the thermosynthesis world was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of the protocell in a convection current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and dissipative structure required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.
By phosphorylating cell membrane lipids, this 'First Protein' gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. In the beginning this First Protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. Just as proposed by Dyson for the first proteins, the First Protein propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. Functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences.
It is assumed RNA sequences were selected among the randomly synthesized RNAs by the relative speed and efficiency increase of First Protein synthesis, for instance by the creation of RNA that functioned as messenger RNA, Transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA, or, even more generally, all the components of the RNA World were also generated and selected. The thermosynthesis world therefore in theory accounts for the origin of the genetic machinery.
Whereas the iron-sulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple—and therefore assumes the existence of enzymes—the thermosynthesis world does not even invoke a pathway, and does not assume the existence of regular enzymes: ATP Synthase's binding change mechanism resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy, rather than a regular enzyme's mechanism, which decreases the free energy. The RNA World also implies the existence of several enzymes. It has been claimed that even the emergence of a single enzyme by chance is implausible.
Bubbles.
Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles. Winds sweeping across the ocean have a tendency to drive floating surface particles to shore. Possibly such shoreline sea foam and windblown organic particles could interact on the beach. Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer, possibly concentrating organic molecules through more rapid evaporation. While bubbles composed mostly of water burst quickly, water containing amphiphiles forms much more stable bubbles, allowing more time for crucial reactions to occur inside them.
Amphiphiles are oily compounds containing a hydrophilic head on one or both ends of a hydrophobic molecule. Some amphiphiles have the tendency to spontaneously form membranes in water. A spherically closed membrane contains water and is a hypothetical precursor to the modern cell membrane. If a protein would increase the integrity of its parent bubble, that bubble had an advantage, and was placed nearer the top of the natural selection "waiting list". Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the bubbles burst, releasing the results of the 'experiment' into the surrounding medium. Once enough of the 'right stuff' was released into the medium, the development of the first prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and multicellular organisms could be achieved.
Similarly, bubbles formed entirely out of protein-like molecules, called microspheres, will form spontaneously under the right conditions. But they are not a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane, as cell membranes are composed primarily of lipid compounds rather than amino-acid compounds (for types of membrane spheres associated with abiogenesis, see protobionts, micelle, coacervate).
A recent model by Fernando and Rowe suggests that the enclosure of an autocatalytic non-enzymatic metabolism within protocells may have been one way of avoiding the side-reaction problem that is typical of metabolism first models.
Pumice rafts.
An alternative (or perhaps adjunct) theory, to the formation of bubbles via waves breaking on the shore creating delicate foam, is the hypothetical creation of bubbles formed within pores of a pumice raft. Like the windblown foam, the pumice rafts would also have made landfall, and this is observed in modern times. Paleontological evidence of pumice rafts associated with Archean life have been discovered in Australia.
Although the windblown concentration of organic molecules may have been a key part of the abiogenesis puzzle, even with amphiphilic stabilization, exposure to the elements may have rendered the fragile foam too unstable to be an abiogenesis precursor and/or its ongoing natural selection actor.
A possibly more probable bubble formation environment for the 'cradle of life' to occur (due to its greater stability-longer 'lifetime') and optimum size (micron) range would have been the protected environment within the pores of the pumice. The crucial reaction time necessary could have been greatly extended in this protected environment. Relatively rapid selection pressure could have been applied if the pumice raft landed on an active geothermal outgassing site (acting something like an airstone in an aquarium) producing various types of bubbles which interacted and evolved.
Other models.
Autocatalysis.
In 1993 Stuart Kauffman proposed that life initially arose as autocatalytic chemical networks.
Autocatalysts are substances that catalyze the production of themselves, and therefore have the property of being a simple molecular replicator. British ethologist Richard Dawkins wrote about autocatalysis as a potential explanation for the origin of life in his 2004 book "The Ancestor's Tale". In his book, Dawkins cites experiments performed by Julius Rebek and his colleagues at the Scripps Research Institute in California in which they combined amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl esters with the autocatalyst amino adenosine triacid ester (AATE). One system from the experiment contained variants of AATE which catalysed the synthesis of themselves. This experiment demonstrated the possibility that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within a population of entities with heredity, which could be interpreted as a rudimentary form of natural selection.
Clay hypothesis.
A model for the origin of life based on clay was forwarded by A. Graham Cairns-Smith of the University of Glasgow in 1985 and explored as a plausible illustration by several scientists. The Clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on a pre-existing, non-organic replication platform of silicate crystals in solution.
Cairns-Smith is a trenchant critic of other models of chemical evolution. However, he admits that like many models of the origin of life, his own also has its shortcomings.
In 2007, Kahr and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of potassium hydrogen phthalate. "Mother" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow "daughter" crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behavior to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals, "were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next".
Gold's "deep-hot biosphere" model.
In the 1970s, Thomas Gold proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometers below the surface. The discovery in the late 1990s of nanobes (filamental structures that are smaller than bacteria, but that may contain DNA) in deep rocks might be seen as lending support to Gold's theory.
It is now reasonably well established that microbial life is plentiful at shallow depths in the Earth, up to below the surface, in the form of extremophile archaea, rather than the better-known eubacteria (which live in more accessible conditions). It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our solar system would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.
"Primitive" extraterrestrial life.
An alternative to Earthly abiogenesis is the hypothesis that primitive life may have originally formed extraterrestrially (Extraterrestrial life), either in space, on Mars or elsewhere. (Note that exogenesis is related to, but not the same as, the notion of panspermia). A supporter of this theory was Francis Crick. Also related, NIH scientists reported studies, based on extrapolating "genetic complexity of organisms to earlier times", suggesting life began " billion years ago", billions of years before the Earth was formed. The scientists noted that Life may have started "from systems with single heritable elements that are functionally equivalent to a nucleotide". (see Abiogenesis#Coenzyme world and Panspermia#Complexity)
Organic compounds are relatively common in space, especially in the outer solar system where volatiles are not evaporated by solar heating. Comets are encrusted by outer layers of dark material, thought to be a tar-like substance composed of complex organic material formed from simple carbon compounds after reactions initiated mostly by irradiation by ultraviolet light. It is supposed that a rain of material from comets could have brought significant quantities of such complex organic molecules to Earth.
An alternative but related hypothesis, proposed to explain the presence of life on Earth so soon after the planet had cooled down, with apparently very little time for prebiotic evolution, is that life formed first on early Mars. Due to its smaller size Mars cooled before Earth (a difference of hundreds of millions of years), allowing prebiotic processes there while Earth was still too hot. Life was then transported to the cooled Earth when crustal material was blasted off Mars by asteroid and comet impacts. Mars continued to cool faster and eventually became hostile to the existence of life.
Neither hypothesis actually answers the question of how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. However, the advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have evolved on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact. Evidence to support the hypothesis is scant, but it finds support in studies of Martian meteorites found in Antarctica and in studies of extremophile microbes. Additional support comes from a recent discovery of a bacterial ecosystem whose energy source is radioactivity.
A 2001 experiment led by Jason Dworkin
subjected a frozen mixture of water, methanol, ammonia and carbon monoxide to UV radiation, mimicking conditions found in an extraterrestrial environment. This combination yielded large amounts of organic material that self-organised to form bubbles or micelles when immersed in water. Dworkin considered these bubbles to resemble cell membranes that enclose and concentrate the chemistry of life, separating their interior from the outside world.
The bubbles produced in these experiments were between , or about the size of red blood cells. Remarkably, the bubbles fluoresced, or glowed, when exposed to UV light. Absorbing UV and converting it into visible light in this way was considered one possible way of providing energy to a primitive cell. If such bubbles played a role in the origin of life, the fluorescence could have been a precursor to primitive photosynthesis. Such fluorescence also provides the benefit of acting as a sunscreen, diffusing any damage that otherwise would be inflicted by UV radiation. Such a protective function would have been vital for life on the early Earth, since the ozone layer, which blocks out the sun's most destructive UV rays, did not form until after photosynthetic life began to produce oxygen.
On 24 January 2014, NASA reported that current studies on the planet Mars by the "Curiosity" and "Opportunity" rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.
Extraterrestrial organic molecules.
Another idea is that amino acids which were formed extraterrestrially arrived on Earth via comets. In 2009 it was announced by NASA that scientists had identified one of the fundamental chemical building blocks of life in a comet for the first time: glycine, an amino acid, was detected in the material ejected from Comet Wild-2 in 2004 and grabbed by NASA's Stardust probe. Tiny grains, just a few thousandths of a millimeter in size, were collected from the comet and returned to Earth in 2006 in a sealed capsule, and distributed among the world's leading astro-biology labs. NASA said in a statement that it took some time for the investigating team, led by Dr Jamie Elsila, to convince itself that the glycine signature found in Stardust's sample bay was genuine and not just Earthly contamination. Glycine has been detected in meteorites before and there are also observations in interstellar gas clouds claimed for telescopes, but the Stardust find is described as a first in cometary material. Isotope analysis indicates that the Late Heavy Bombardment included cometary impacts after the Earth coalesced but before life evolved. Dr. Carl Pilcher, who leads NASA's Astrobiology Institute commented that "The discovery of glycine in a comet supports the idea that the fundamental building blocks of life are prevalent in space, and strengthens the argument that life in the Universe may be common rather than rare."
Based on computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of the Earth. According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets. (Also see Cosmic dust/Earth.)
Recent observations suggests that the majority of organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles are considered principal agents in the formation of complex molecules, thanks to their peculiar surface-catalytic activities. Studies reported in 2008, based on 12C/13C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, suggested that the RNA component uracil and related molecules, including xanthine, were formed extraterrestrially. On August 8, 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) were made in outer space. More recently, scientists found that the cosmic dust permeating the universe contains complex organic matter ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. As one of the scientists noted, "Coal and kerogen are products of life and it took a long time for them to form ... How do stars make such complicated organics under seemingly unfavorable conditions and it so rapidly?" Further, the scientist suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on earth and said that, "If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life."
In 2000, Jes Jørgensen and Jan M. Hollis from the Copenhagen University, reported that in the star-forming region near the center of our galaxy they found glycolaldehyde – the first evidence of an interstellar sugar molecule. Then, in August 29, 2012, the same team reported the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary "IRAS 16293-2422", which is located 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. These findings suggest that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. Because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code, two of the most basic aspects of life, it is rationalized the discovery of any sugar in space would increase the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere in our galaxy.
On April 3, 2013, NASA reported that complex organic chemicals could arise on Titan, a moon of Saturn, based on studies simulating the atmosphere of Titan.
Lipid world.
The lipid world theory postulates that the first self-replicating object was lipid-like. It is known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation – the same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other amphiphilic long chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two progenies. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favorably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.
Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favored the constitution of an hypercycle, according to the terminology by Manfred Eigen, actually a positive feedback composed of two mutual catalysts represented by a membrane site and a specific compound trapped in the vesicle. Such site/compound pairs are transmissible to the daughter vesicles leading to the emergence of distinct lineages of vesicles which would have allowed Darwinian natural selection.<br>
Polyphosphates.
A problem in most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates. Polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO4−3. Several mechanisms for such polymerization have been suggested. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as ATP. A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate.
There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.
PAH world hypothesis.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to be abundant in the universe, including in the interstellar medium, in comets, and in meteorites, and are some of the most complex molecules so far found in space. 
Other sources of complex molecules have been postulated, including extraterrestrial stellar or interstellar origin. For example, from spectral analyses, organic molecules are known to be present in comets and meteorites. In 2004, a team detected traces of PAHs in a nebula. More recently, in 2010, another team also detected PAHs, along with fullerenes (or "buckyballs"), in nebulae. The use of PAHs has also been proposed as a precursor to the RNA world in the PAH world hypothesis. The Spitzer Space Telescope has recently detected a star, HH 46-IR, which is forming by a process similar to that by which the sun formed. In the disk of material surrounding the star, there is a very large range of molecules, including cyanide compounds, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that PAHs, subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics - "a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively". Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks."
On 21 February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking PAHs in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.
Multiple genesis.
Different forms of life with variable origin processes may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early history of Earth. The other forms may be extinct, leaving distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry (e.g., using arsenic instead of phosphorus), survive as extremophiles, or simply be unnoticed through their being analogous to organisms of the current life tree. Hartman for example combines a number of theories together, by proposing that:
The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other dicarboxylic acids. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.
Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic theory suggests that multiple forms of archea entered into symbiotic relationship to form the eukaryotic cell. The horizontal transfer of genetic material between archea promotes such symbiotic relationships, and thus many separate organisms may have contributed to building what has been recognised as the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of modern organisms.

USS Gadsden (AK-182)

USS "Gadsden" (AK-182) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship acquired by the U.S. Navy during the final months of World War II. She served the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations for a short period of time before being decommissioned and returned to the U.S. Maritime Administration.
Built in Superior, Wisconsin.
"Gadsden" was launched 8 April 1944 under Maritime Commission contract by Walter Butler Shipbuilders, Inc., Superior, Wisconsin; sponsored by Mrs. Morgan Murphy of Superior; acquired by the Navy on loan-charter basis 26 December 1944; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, 28 February 1945, Lt. W. J. Sattel in command.
World War II service.
After shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, "Gadsden" departed New Orleans 31 March 1945 with a cargo of frozen meat and ammunition for Ulithi, Western Caroline Islands, where she arrived on 11 May after 34 days at sea. From there she proceeded to Kossol Roads, Palau Islands for a 3-day stay marked by alerts for enemy suicide swimmers. 
She was convoyed by way of Leyte to Morotai Island, Netherlands East Indies, where she spent 3 months as ammunition ship for units of the U.S. 7th Fleet. At times, she serviced six to eight ships a day as she handled much of the ammunition used by fleet units for the Brunei Bay-Balikpapan invasions of Borneo.
"Gadsden" arrived at Leyte 31 July 1945 with about one-third of her cargo. She served as ammunition ship there until announcement of the Japanese capitulation. On 21 August 1945, she departed Leyte on a shuttle cargo run to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, and Hollandia, New Guinea; thence back to Leyte and was routed onward to Manila, Philippine Islands.
Post-war decommissioning.
"Gadsden" put to sea from Manila 26 November 1945; transited the Panama Canal 8 January 1946; and reached Norfolk, Virginia, on the 19th for inactivation. She decommissioned 31 January 1946 and was redelivered to the U.S. Maritime Commission on 1 February 1946 for layup in the Maritime James River fleet. She was subsequently sold to the Korean Shipping Corp. and renamed "Yosu". Her current disposition is not known.
Honors and awards.
Qualified "Gadsden" personnel were eligible for the following:
Note.
DANFS lists the name of this ship as "Gadsen", while other sources, including Lloyd's Shipping Register 1958/59, Vol. One) indicate her name as "Gadsden" which appears to be the correct spelling as the Navy named the ship after Gadsden County, Florida.

Tripleurospermum maritimum

Tripleurospermum maritimum (syn. "Matricaria maritimum") is a species of flowering plant in the aster family commonly known as sea mayweed. It is found in many coastal areas of Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and Iceland, often growing in sand or amongst beach pebbles. 
As with many maritime plants, sea mayweed has fleshy leaves which help it to survive in the harsh salty environment. The leaves are divided into short segments. When crushed, they yield a sweet smell similar to that of its relative chamomile, though much fainter.
The daisy-like flowers usually appear between July and September and can reach up to 50 mm across. The stems of the plant are frequently tinged red towards the base.
In Iceland, sea mayweed is known as Baldr's eyelashes (baldursbrá), though this name is also given to scentless mayweed in Norway and Sweden.

Ian Hibell

Ian Hibell (January 6, 1934 – 23 August 2008) was a cyclist who spent the better part of 40 years of his life bicycling in various parts of the world, accomplishing many firsts in cycling. 
Hibell, who was born in the Epsom district in Surrey, lived in Brixham, Devon, England and attended Torquay Boys' Grammar School. From 1971 through 1973 he became the first to cycle from Cape Horn to Alaska.
Hibell co-authored a book entitled "Into the Remote Places" documenting his travels. 
He lectured on his travels in Great Britain and the United States, including Yale University. He also designed some of his own gear, including front and rear luggage racks.
Ian Hibell began cycle-touring when not all his family could afford to travel to a seaside holiday by train. He and his father cycled there, sleeping on park benches and anywhere else they could find. He worked at Standard Telephones and Cables and took leave to go cycling, eventually riding more than he was working. He went on to ride the equivalent of ten times round the equator, covering 6,000 miles a year. He is recognised as first to cycle the Darién Gap in Panama and from south to north of the Americas.
He also rode from Norway to the Cape of Good Hope and from Bangkok to Vladivostok.
A van drove over his arm and hand in China in 2006. He came close to losing his life after losing his bicycle while riding across the Sahara. He recounted how he was saved by wandering Arabs, who could see his bicycle even though he couldn't, and that all he had with which to reward them was a tube of sun cream, "which I didn't think they would particularly need."
His favourite bike had a Freddie Grubb frame of Reynolds 531 tubing, reinforced for extra weight. In his book, "Into the Remote Places" (1984), he called his bike a companion, crutch and friend. "The quiet hum of the wheels, the creak of strap against load, the clink of something in the pannier", was "delicious". 
Hibell was killed on 23 August 2008 in Greece by a hit and run driver on the Athens-Salonika highway near Nea Erithrea.

Lewis Ayres

Dr. Lewis Ayres, a lay Catholic theologian, is Professor of Catholic and Historical Theology at Durham University in the United Kingdom (and well known Big Green Egg pit master). Between 2009 and 2013 he served as the inaugural holder of the Bede Chair of Catholic Theology at Durham.
Biography.
Lewis Ayres was born and educated in the UK, completing his M.A. at the University St. Andrews (1988) and his D.Phil. at Merton College, Oxford University (1994). He has taught in the UK, in Ireland at Trinity College Dublin and in the United States at Duke University and Emory University.
Research.
The core of his research has been Trinitarian theology in Augustine and in the Greek writers of the 4th century. Ayres's period of research into patristic pneumatology has resulted in a collaborative translation of patristic texts on the Holy Spirit, but as yet the much anticipated monograph on the subject has not appeared. Besides Trinitarian theology in this pivotal period he is also interested in the later development of Trinitarian theology and in the place of Scripture in Early Christianity – both the history of Christian reading practices from the late 2nd century and the history of what can be termed the theology of Scripture itself. He is at present writing a monograph that will concern the shifts in Patristic exegesis between AD 150 and 250. It is provisionally entitled "As It Is Written: Ancient Literary Criticism and the Rise of Scripture AD 100-250".
Ayres claims "a number of interests in modern Catholic fundamental and dogmatic theology – as will be evident from the last chapter of "Nicaea" and some of the articles I have published." That chapter of Ayres's book was subject to sustained critical attention by Maurice Wiles, in the latter's review of the book ("Journal of Theological Studies" 56.2 (2005): 670-675). Wiles's sharpest criticism is that Ayres fails to show that his approach "is compatible with modern changes in our understanding of the scriptural grounds of the doctrine of the Trinity and its development in the early patristic period." With reference to two specific examples, Wiles characterises Ayres's 'way of reading the scriptural text' as 'forced and unconvincing'. Wiles connected these interpretive practices with Ayres's underlying conception of the Church.
Ayres also declares strong interest in the place of Scripture (and Tradition) in modern Catholic theology and the fundamental structure of Catholic theology. He is convinced that the ideological and professional divisions that have arisen between Scripture scholars, "systematic" and "historical" theologians have served Catholic theology ill. He believes that "ressourcement" theologians have offered us many resources that can move us beyond these divisions, but much further work is necessary for their agenda to be taken forward. In the hopes of contributing to this debate he is working on a book for Blackwells entitled "Resting in the Word". With his wife, Medi Ann Volpe(PhD: Duke University, 2006), he is also co-editing the "Oxford Handbook of Catholic Theology" (hopefully forthcoming in 2014). He has co-edited the Blackwells series "Challenges in Contemporary Theology" for the past 18 years. He also serves on the editorial boards of the "Journal of Early Christian Studies", "Modern Theology" and "Augustinian Studies".
Collaboration with Michel Barnes.
Together with Michel Barnes, Associate Professor of Theology at Marquette University, and Rowan Williams, Ayres is part of a rereading of Augustine's trinitarian theology that breaks with the older neoplatonic-centered account. In his 2007 doctoral dissertation, Keith Edward Johnson referred to this new reading as "New Canon" Augustine scholarship. From a footnote in Johnson's dissertation (p. 108 n. 189), that name would appear to have been taken from a publication by Barnes; however, the bibliography does not provide further details. The basis of the New Canon reading of Augustine was worked out in the years 1995-2000, during which Ayres and Barnes conducted an almost daily common reading and discussion, via e-mail, of Augustine's trinitarian writings.
The mutuality of Barnes' and Ayres' partnership is evident from the following comments in their respective papers, "Remember you are Catholic" and "Rereading Augustine on the Trinity":

Joséf Pagés

Joséf Pagés, who was born circa 1740 and died after 1822, was a notable Spanish guitar maker of the Cádiz school.
Life and work.
Joséf Pagés was probably born in Ecija, Sevilla around 1740. His brother Juan Pagés also became a notable guitar maker. It is thought that Joséf was the first of the brothers to go to Cádiz around 1760. He established his workshop in Calle de la Almargura by 1809. A leading member of the Cádiz school, Joséf, followed very closely all the innovations that Francisco Sanguino had introduced, but with the additional development of doming the soundboard with the struts, an approach that later makers such as Jose Recio, Antonio de Torres, and Francisco Gonzales also adopted. Pagés started with systems of three braces, like the early guitars of Sanguino and Benedid; his later instruments used five.
His guitars greatly influenced Louis Panormo, who used similar fan strutting designs and similar proportions for the body of the guitar.
The great Spanish composer and guitarist Fernando Sor thought highly of Pagés's guitars, stating 'The guitars to which I have always given preference are those of Alonso of Madrid, Pagés and Benediz of Cádiz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga...' The composer Dionisio Aguado also mentions the Pagés brothers as among the makers he would recommend. Joséf Pagés's known surviving guitars date from the 1790s to 1822.

Shi Jinmo

Shi Jinmo (Chinese: 施今墨; March 28, 1881 - August 22, 1969), former name Shi Yuqian (施毓黔), was a renowned expert and practitioner of Chinese traditional medicine. His ancestral hometown was Kanshan Town, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, and he was born in Guizhou Province.
Shi devoted his life to practice, reform and education of Chinese traditional medicine. He suggested using modern science and technology to study the traditional medicine, and advocated the integration of Chinese traditional medicine and western medical practice. Shi maintained close personal relations with some prominent political figures at that time, such as Sun Yet-Sen, Huang Xing, Yang Hucheng and Zhou Enlai.
Biography.
During his childhood, Shi's mother suffered a lot of illness. At age of 13, Shi started learning traditional medicine with his uncle. In 1902, his father took him to Shanxi, and sent him into Shanxi Grand Academy (now Shanxi University). He was expelled from this school due to his dissent from the principal's campaign. From 1903 to 1906, he studied at Shanxi Judicial and Political Academy. After graduation, he was enrolled in Capital Judicial and Political Academy, and meanwhile, started his medical practice. During that time, Shi actively supported Xinhai Revolution, and devoted to social welfare. In 1912, as a delegate from Shanxi, Shi attended the inauguration ceremony of the Temporary Grand President of the Republic of China, Sun Yet-Sen. Later, he assisted Huang Xing to draft the army's military law. 
Due to the ominous political atmosphere, Shi attained his belief that "if one can not be a good minister, be a good doctor", and thus concentrated on his medical practice. He broke one character in his name, Qian (黔), and adopted Jinmo (今墨) as his name, incarnating the spirit of "shared love" of Mozi and the medicinal canon of Mozi. 
Shi was reviled in Cultural Revolution. His health seriously deteriorated in spring 1969, and he died on August 22 in Beijing.

<doc id="19180003" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19180003" title="Amoeba">
Amoeba

Amoeba (sometimes amœba or ameba, plural amoebae or amoebas) is a genus of Protozoa that consists of unicellular organisms which do not have a definite shape.
History.
The microscopic amoeba was first discovered by August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof in 1757. Early naturalists referred to "Amoeba" as the "Proteus animalcule" after the Greek god Proteus, who could change his shape. The name "amibe" was given to it by Bory de Saint-Vincent, from the Greek "amoibè" (αμοιβή), meaning change. "Dientamoeba fragili" was first described in 1918, and was linked to harm in humans.
Anatomy.
Amoebae's most recognizable features include one or more nuclei and a simple contractile vacuole to maintain osmotic equilibrium - low water amounts in cell protecting cell from bursting with excess water. Food enveloped by the amoeba is stored and digested in vacuoles. Amoebae, like other unicellular eukaryotic organisms, reproduce asexually via mitosis and cytokinesis, not to be confused with binary fission, which is how prokaryotes (bacteria) reproduce. In cases where the amoeba are forcibly divided, the portion that retains the nucleus will survive and form a new cell and cytoplasm, while the other portion dies. Amoebae also have no definite shape.
Movement.
Amoeba move by using pseudopodia or "false feet".
Pseudopodia are formed by the amoeba by throwing out the cytoplasm, followed by endoplasm flowing inward.
Genome.
The amoeba is remarkable for its very large genome. The species "Amoeba proteus" has 290 billion base pairs in its genome, while the related "Polychaos dubium" (formerly known as "Amoeba dubia") has 670 billion base pairs. The human genome is small by contrast, with its count of 2.9 billion base pairs. Unicellular budding yeast has an estimated 12 million pairs.
Osmoregulation.
Like most other protists, amoebae have a contractile vacuole. "Amoeba proteus", a free-living, freshwater species of amoeba, has one contractile vacuole (CV), which is a membrane-bound organelle. The CV slowly fills with water from the cytoplasm (diastole), and, while fusing with the cell membrane, it quickly contracts releasing water to the outside (systole) by exocytosis. This process regulates the amount of water present in the cytoplasm of the amoeba; it is, a means of osmoregulation.
Immediately after the CV expels water, its membrane crumples, and soon afterwards, many small vacuoles or vesicles appear surrounding the membrane of the CV. It is suggested that these vesicles split from the CV membrane itself. The small vesicles gradually increase in size as they take in water and then they fuse with the CV, which grows in size as it fills with water. Therefore, the function of these numerous small vesicles is to collect excess cytoplasmic water and channel it to the central CV. The CV swells for a number of minutes and then contracts to expel the water outside. The cycle is then repeated again.
The membranes of the small vesicles as well as the membrane of the CV have aquaporin proteins embedded in them. These transmembrane proteins facilitate water passage through the membranes. The presence of aquaporin proteins in both CV and the small vesicles suggests that water collection occurs both through the CV membrane itself as well as through the function of the vesicles. However, the vesicles, being more numerous and smaller, would allow a faster water uptake due to the larger total surface area provided by the vesicles.
The small vesicles also have another protein embedded in its membrane: Vacuolar-type H+-ATPase or V-ATPase. This ATPase pumps H+ ions into the vesicle lumen, lowering its pH with respect to the cytosol. However, the pH of the CV in some amoebas is only mildly acidic, suggesting that the H+ ions are being removed from the CV or from the vesicles. It is thought that the electrochemical gradient generated by V-ATPase might be used for the transport of ions (it is presumed K+ and Cl-) into the vesicles. This builds an osmotic gradient across the vesicle membrane, leading to influx of water from the cytosol into the vesicles by osmosis, which is facilitated by aquaporins.
Since these vesicles fuse with the central contractile vacuole, which expels the water, ions end up being removed from the cell, which is not beneficial for a freshwater organism. The removal of ions with the water has to be compensated by some yet-unidentified mechanism.
Like most cells, amoebae are adversely affected by excessive osmotic pressure caused by extremely saline or dilute water. Amoebae will prevent the influx of salt in saline water, resulting in a net loss of water as the cell becomes isotonic with the environment, causing the cell to shrink. Placed into fresh water, amoebae will also attempt to match the concentration of the surrounding water, causing the cell to swell and sometimes burst if the water surrounding the amoeba is too dilute.
Amoebic cysts.
In environments that are potentially lethal to the cell, an amoeba may become dormant by forming itself into a ball and secreting a protective membrane to become a microbial cyst. The cell remains in this state until it encounters more favourable conditions. While in cyst form the amoeba will not replicate and may die if unable to emerge for a lengthy period of time.
Nutrition in amoeba.
Amoeba obtains its nutrition in a heterotrophic mode. Both the anabolic and catabolic functions are carried out in the same cell. Amoeba feeds on plankton and diatoms present in water. It can form arm- like structures called pseudopodia, extending from any part of its body as it is shapeless. When it senses food in its surroundings it extends its pseudopodia in that direction and moves towards it. Then it engulfs the food with its pseudopodia. When the food enters its body the amoeba forms a food vacuole around it which contains certain enzymes to digest the food. When the food is digested the unwanted waste is released through its body surface.
Reproduction of "amoeba".
Asexuality (reproduction by binary fission) is often thought to be a defining characteristic of amoebae. However, analysis of 71 isolates of amoeba from the same geographical area along a river indicated that sex must be occurring in that particular lineage. Recently, Lahr et al. proposed that the majority of amoeboid lineages are, contrary to popular belief, at least anciently sexual, and that most current asexual groups have arisen recently and independently. In addition, recent evidence also indicates that several other single-celled eukaryotes that were previously regarded as asexual are, or were in the past, capable of sexual reproduction. These findings have led to the idea that sex was present in the earliest common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

Angeline Greensill

Angeline Ngahina Greensill (born 1948) is a prominent Māori political rights campaigner, academic and leader.
Early life.
Greensill is of Tainui, Ngati Porou, and Ngati Paniora descent, born in the late 1940s in Kirikiriroa (Hamilton) and raised at Te Kopua (Raglan), Whaingaroa on the turangawaewae of Tainui o Tainui ki Whaingaroa. She was educated at Raglan Primary, Raglan District High School, Hamilton Technical College, Hamilton Teachers College and at Waikato University. She holds a Trained Teachers Certificate, LLB (Bachelor of Laws), Bachelor of Social Sciences with 1st class Honours and is currently completing a Masters of Social Science.
Greensill's first job was as a primary school teacher both in New Zealand and in Brisbane. Between 1984-1996 while raising her young family, she worked for her hapu as co-ordinator of employment and skills training and conservation programmes for youth in the Raglan Catchment area. After completing a law degree she was employed by University of Waikato in 1999 to teach in the Department of Geography, Tourism and Environmental Planning specialising in treaties, Māori Geography and Resource Management.
The environment.
As an advocate for the protection of the environment and for Maori land rights of West Coast whanau and hapu in the Whaingaroa area since the mid-70s, Greensill's legal efforts have been crucial in helping to block human-cow transgenic field trials being conducted by AgResearch Ltd, and helped to educate Māori communities on the implications of Genetic Engineering. Due to her expertise in this field she was interviewed in the documentary film The Leech and the Earthworm by Max Pugh and Marc Silver.
Land rights.
Greensill asssisted in organising the land occupation at the Raglan Golf Course (see Māori protest movement), which played a prominent role in helping recognise issues around Māori land rights in New Zealand. Greensill was with her mother, Eva Rickard, when she was arrested on charges of trespassing. Due to prolonged legal efforts the land was later returned to the local tribe. Greensill was also involved in land occupations at Bastion Point, Awhitu, and others elsewhere.
Political background.
Greensill was one of the final co-leaders of the Mana Māori Movement, which she called into recess in 2005 so that the combined efforts of that party could be utilised in the founding and promoting of the Māori Party. In the past Greensill supported Māori political party Mana Motuhake. One policy Greensill has advocated for is the recognition in law of the 1835 Declaration of Independence.
Greensill unsuccessfully stood for the Māori Party in the Maori electorate seat of Hauraki-Waikato in the New Zealand general election, 2008. In 2011, however, she joined the breakaway Mana Party, saying that the Māori Party was no longer listening to the people. She contested the Hauraki-Waikato electorate again for her new party in the 2011 election.

Worm

The term worm refers to an obsolete taxon ("vermes") used by Carolus Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals, and stems from the Old English word "wyrm". Currently it is used to describe many different distantly related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no legs. Most animals called "worms" are invertebrates, but the term is also used for the amphibian caecilians and the slow worm "Anguis", a legless burrowing lizard. Invertebrate animals commonly called "worms" include annelids (earthworms), nematodes (roundworms), platyhelminthes (flatworms), marine polychaete worms (bristle worms), marine nemertean worms ("bootlace worms"), marine Chaetognatha (arrow worms), priapulid worms, and insect larvae such as caterpillars, grubs, and maggots. Historical English-speaking cultures have used the (now deprecated) terms "worm", "Wurm", or "wyrm" to describe carnivorous reptiles ("serpents"), and the related mythical beasts dragons. The term worm can also be used as an insult or pejorative term used towards people to describe a cowardly or weak individual or individual seen as pitiable.
Worms vary in size from microscopic to over in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle worms), for the African giant earthworm, "Microchaetus", and for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm), "Lineus longissimus".
Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals. Free-living worm species may live on land, in marine or freshwater environments, or burrow.
Distribution and habitat.
Worms live in almost all parts of the world including marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. Some worms living in the ground help to condition the soil (e.g., annelids, aschelminths). Many thrive as parasites of plants (e.g., aschelminths) and animals, including humans (e.g., platyhelminths, aschelminths). Several other worms may be free-living, or nonparasitic. There are worms that live in freshwater, seawater, and even on the seashore. Ecologically, worms form an important link in the food chains in virtually all the ecosystems of the world.
In the United States, the average population of worms per acre is 53,767.
Classification.
In everyday language, the term "worm" is also applied to various other living forms such as larvae, insects, centipedes, shipworms (teredo worms), or even some vertebrates (creatures with a backbone) such as blindworms and caecilians. Worms can be divided into several groups, but are still technically decomposers.
In earlier taxonomic classification, all the above were included in the now obsolete group Vermes.
There are hundreds of thousands of species that live in a wide variety of habitats other than soil. Over time this broad definition narrowed to the modern definition, although this still includes several different animal groups. Phyla that include worms include:
To most people the most familiar worms are the earthworms, members of phylum Annelida. Earthworms in general have been around for 120 million years. They enrich and aerate the soil; Charles Darwin found that worms turn over the top six inches (15 cm) of topsoil every 20 years in a field near where he lived. In less favourable conditions, such as waterlogged soils or hard soil deficient in suitable organic matter, or in seasonally dry soils, they cannot achieve anything like that. They lack a brain in the sense of the vertebrate brain, but have nerve centers (called ganglia); they also lack eyes but can sense light with photoreceptors. Worms are hermaphrodites (both sexes in one animal) but can cross fertilize.
Other invertebrate groups may be called worms, especially colloquially. In particular, many unrelated insect larvae are called "worms", such as the railroad worm, woodworm, glowworm, bloodworm, inchworm, mealworm, silkworm, Wooly bear worm.
Worms may also be called helminths, particularly in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms, especially the Nematoda (roundworms) and Cestoda (tapeworms). Hence "helminthology" is the study of parasitic worms. When an animal, such as a dog, is said to "have worms", it means that it is infested with parasitic worms, typically roundworms or tapeworms.
"Ringworm" is not a worm at all, but a skin fungus.
Characteristics.
Some species of earthworms have a tongue-like lobe above the mouth called prostomium. The prostomium is actually a sensory device. Earthworms do not have a nose, eyes, ears, or hands to gather sensory information about their environment. Instead, they depend on their prostomium and sensory receptors in their skin to "feel" their way through the soil. 
Worms usually have a cylindrical, flattened, or leaf-like body shape and are often without any true limbs or appendages. Instead, they may have bristles or fins that help them move. A few have light-sensing organs. Worms vary in size from less than 1 mm (0.04 inch) in certain aschelminths to more than 30 m (100 feet) in certain ribbon worms.
Some worms reproduce sexually. Hermaphroditism, the condition in which a single individual possesses both male and female reproductive parts, is common in many groups of worms. Asexual reproduction, whereby new individuals develop from the body cells of another, also occurs in some worms.
Worm species differ in their abilities to move about on their own. Many species have bodies with no major muscles, and cannot move on their own—they must be moved by forces or other animals in their environment. Many other species have bodies with major muscles and can move on their own; they are a type of muscular hydrostat. Many species of worms are decomposers; they break down dead plants and animals to return nutrients to the soil. They have also been known to infiltrate households feeding on food in the early stages of its decomposition namely breads and cheeses.
Earthworms split into three different categories. The first are the surface dwellers, the Epigeic worms. Then there are the upper soil worms, the Endogeic worms. Finally, there are the deep burrowing species, the Anecic.
Image in mythology, literature, and art.
Worms are sometimes used as a metaphor of putrefaction or corruption; a corpse may be said to be "fed to the worms".

Gamma-150 RNA motif

The gamma-150 RNA motif is a conserved RNA structure that is found in bacteria within the order Pseudomonadales. Because gamma-150 RNAs are not consistently in 5' UTRs, the gamma-150 motif is presumed to correspond to a non-coding RNA.
Experiments conducted on RNA transcripts in "Pseudomonas syringae" DC3000 revealed that two gamma-150 RNAs in that organism are transcribed as separate RNA molecules. The transcript length is roughly 380 nucleotides in size, which is almost twice as large as the gamma-150 motif itself. It is likely that they are transcribed by RpoN, a protein that is also referred to as sigma 54.
Structurally, the gamma-150 motif consists of four independent stem-loops. The first stem-loop (the stem-loop closest to the 5' end of the RNA) has significant covariation in support of its identity as an RNA (see secondary structure prediction). The second and fourth have more modest evidence, while the third stem-loop might be poorly conserved, or not genuine. Several regions of high conservation of nucleotide identity are present throughout the RNA motif, and many contain short runs of adenosines.

Church penitentiary

The original Church penitentiary for the reclamation of fallen women was founded in 1806 in London, the most well known centre was set up by former British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone in 1848. Its aim was the convent-based rehabilitation of women, including prostitutes, thieves, the homeless, alcoholics etc. They were charitable organisations and not in place for the punishment of crimes.
The Church Penitentiary Association existed from 1852 until 1951. There are records on the association in the Library at Lambeth Palace, the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury in London,and in the National Archives [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/accessions/1994/94returns/94ac109.htm.

Stanly Community College

Stanly Community College (SCC) is one of 58 community colleges in the North Carolina (NC) Community College System (NCCCS). SCC is located in Albemarle, NC with a satellite campus in Locust, NC. This institution is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The college serves over 10,000 students annually in all types of programs including associate degree, diploma, certificate, general education, occupational training, adult literacy, and a comprehensive online degree program.
History.
Chartered in 1971, Stanly Community College opened in temporary headquarters on the old South Albemarle High School campus that same year. A faculty of eight instructors offered classes in auto mechanics, air conditioning and refrigeration, secretarial science, industrial management, brick masonry and business. In five months the school grew from 31 students to almost 400, and discussions began about the possible construction of a new campus.
Construction on the new campus began in 1974 and in October 1975 the Academic/Administration Building (now the Patterson Building) and the Vocational Shop Building were completed. The latter structure has since undergone renovations and now houses the college’s student recreational room, cafeteria, student success center and bookstore. In the fall of 1998 it was renamed the Webb Student Center in honor of Dr. H.T. Webb, a long-time college trustee. The Kelley Building — named for Annie Ruth Kelley, first chair of the college’s board of trustees — opened in 1981. The college purchased the 1960-era Industrial Training Center in 1981. This facility, recently renovated, is now known as the Continuing Education Center. It presently houses the college’s vocational/industrial, public service/health, and corporate/professional development programs.
In 1987 a new two-story classroom/lab building was completed to house the college’s extensive allied health programs. The next building on campus to be built was a much-needed library/classroom facility. Completed in early 1996, the 27,000-square-foot building houses SCC’s library and TV studio facilities on the first floor and seven classrooms and the college’s North Carolina Information Highway Center on the second floor. These buildings now bear the names of two Albemarle residents who are long-time college supporters. The Allied Health Building was renamed the Eddins Building in honor of Dr. George E. Eddins, Jr. 
The Learning Resources Center/Classroom Building was named the Snyder Building in honor of Edward J. Snyder, Jr., former member of the board of trustees and former member of the North Carolina State Board of Community Colleges. The newest building on the main campus was finished in early 1999 and named the Whitley Technology Center in honor of Elbert L. Whitley, Jr., a member of the SCC board of trustees since 1977 and chairman since 1983. This 10,000-square-foot facility is home to six state-of-the-art computer labs that allow the college to offer the latest technology courses and programs to SCC students.
In September 2003 a satellite campus opened in Locust, NC – the Crutchfield Education Center. This 33,000-square-foot facility was named for Edward E. Crutchfield, a Stanly County native and retired CEO of Wachovia Bank. The campus is a complete college in itself, with faculty and staff office space, large modern classrooms, computer labs, health services and biology labs, a conference room, bookstore, and a distance learning classroom and media/resource center. The Crutchfield campus also serves as a regional training center for in-service law enforcement, and is home to the regionally recognized Carolina Auction Academy.

<doc id="19180182" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19180182" title="Massey-Harris Model 81">
Massey-Harris Model 81

The Massey-Harris Model 81 was a two-plow small-farm tractor built by Massey-Harris (later Massey Ferguson) from 1941-1948. Introduced to replace Massey's General GG, the 81 was paired with the Model 82 (which used kerosene, or tractor vaporizing oil {TVO}, as it was known in Britain) and was very similar to the Model 101 Junior, which first appeared in 1939. It was offered in standard-tread and row-crop versions, as was the Model 20 that followed it. The Model 81 was joined in 1946 by the Model 20, both of which survived in production until 1948.
Pricing.
With a base price of around C$800, it was competitive with the C$900 John Deere A. and less than Ford and Ferguson-Brown models of the period.
Weight.
The bare weight without ballast was 2,600 lb (1,170 kg), some 1,100 lb {580 kg} less than the contemporary Model 30.
Engines.
The 81 used the same 124 in3 (2,031 cc) engine of the 101 Junior, while the 82 used a 140 in3 (2,293 cc) model. The 124 in3 was rated at 21 hp (15.7 kW) at the belt, and was manufactured by Continental, like all Massey-Harris tractors at the time.
Use by Royal Canadian Air Force.
The Royal Canadian Air Force used blue-painted standards as aircraft tugs, out of under 2,600 standard-tread 81s made.

Run (novel)

Run is a 2007 novel by American author Ann Patchett. It is her first novel to be published since her widely successful "Bel Canto" (2001).
Plot summary.
This novel tells the story of Bernard Doyle, an Irish Catholic Boston politician. He married, had one son, and adopted two more. The adopted kids are African-American brothers named Tip and Teddy. (The adoptees' names were given to them by the Doyles as a tribute to the Massachusetts politicians Thomas "Tip" O'Neill and Edward "Teddy" Kennedy) Four years later, Doyle loses his wife to cancer. Sixteen years after his wife's death, their two adopted sons are University students. Bernard, the former mayor of Boston, has invited them to a Jesse Jackson lecture. After the lecture, Bernard asks his sons to go to a reception. Tip declines and backs off a curb into the path of an oncoming car. A woman in the crowd pushes him out of the way and is injured in the process. The novel's plot centers around the story of that woman's identity. Her daughter, an 11 year old girl named Kenya, asks to live with the Doyles. The plot has to do with interracial adoption, familial allegiances and rivalries and Boston’s notoriously complex political and racial history.
Reception.
Leah Hager Cohen, of "The New York Times", reviewed the book, saying: 
"If Patchett had exhumed her characters’ motivations more thoroughly, she might have persuaded readers of the circumstances that led to such a choice. And in so doing she might have elicited deeper sympathy and interest. The Jesse Jackson lecture turns out to be little more than a set piece, and the characters’ racial identities are either ignored or too broadly indicated. (Kenya and her mother live in a housing project; Kenya, Tip and Teddy are all endowed with a stereotypical black athletic gift, a talent for running.) It’s difficult to understand why an author would seed her story with potentially rich material only to refrain from exploring it. But this might explain why Patchett’s characters ultimately feel less real than symbolic, as wooden as the Virgin’s statue."
Writing for "The New Yorker", John Updike offered the following insight: "As realism, her novel is pale; but as a metaphoric representation of growth it transcends its sentimentality." 
Andrew O'Hagan, Signature Review for Publishers Weekly: " ... the book is lovely to read and is satisfyingly bold in its attempt to say something patient and true about family."
"Run" is a "New York Times" bestseller.

Bayou Bucks

Bayou Bucks is a deer hunting DVD series that is filmed entirely throughout Louisiana.
Bayou Bucks: Season I.
The first installment, Season I, was filmed during the 2006-2007 hunting season by producer Jason Aycock and released for sale during the 2008-2009 hunting season Critics consider Bayou Bucks unique because it features ordinary hunters with no television experience, portrayed in a documentary film style format not common in typical hunting videos [http://www.nwlanews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=9686. Aside from the video series, Bayou Bucks is also known for its internet web site bayoubucks.com which has quickly developed into an interactive online community for Louisiana based hunters. On October 17, 2008, the Louisiana Outdoor Writers Association awarded Jason Aycock with the 1st Place honor of Excellence in Craft within the Electronic Media Category [http://paradiselouisiana.com/Default/Articles/Entries/2008/10/19_LOWA_Awards_Banquet_2008.html for his production of Bayou Bucks.
Bayou Bucks: Season II.
The second installment of Bayou Bucks will be in production throughout the fall of 2008 and 2009, and is scheduled to be released during the fall of 2010. As with Season I, all of the footage is being filmed in Louisiana and will feature ordinary people hunting their own particular styles and locations [http://www.bayoubucks.com/]. Unlike Season I which is for sale predominantly in Louisiana, the second season of Bayou Bucks will be available commercially throughout the entire United States, with a goal of bringing the Louisiana style of hunting and hunters to the rest of the country’s living rooms.
About Bayou Bucks’ Producer.
Bayou Bucks was first conceptualized in 2003 by avid deer hunter Jason Aycock, a Southeastern Louisiana University marketing student, who at the time grew weary of the generic lineup of hunting videos being produced Unable to find any hunting videos to his liking, Aycock sought the knowledge to produce his own video, and worked his way up the ranks part time at The Southeastern Channel under Emmy Award winning mentor Rick Settoon. Throughout his tenure as graduate assistant at The Southeastern Channel, Aycock learned the art of video production, and graduated SLU in December 2006 with his Masters Degree in Business Administration[http://www.nwlanews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=9686. Immediately thereafter, he purchased a broadcast production package and editing suite, pursuing production of Bayou Bucks full time that hunting season.

Watches of the Night

Watches of the Night is a short story by Rudyard Kipling. It was first published in the "Civil and Military Gazette" on March 25, 1887; in book form, first in the first Indian edition of "Plain Tales from the Hills" in 1888; and in the many subsequent editions of that collection. It is one of the "Tales" which deals with the tense, enclosed society of the British in India, and the levels of gossip and malice that could be engendered therein.
'Watches of the Night', like many of Kipling's works, has a punning, allusive title. The phrase 'watches of the night' has been used since at least the Book of Common Prayer (1662), and dates back further: "the watches of the night: the night-time; watch originally each of the three or four periods of time, during which a watch or guard was kept, into which the night was divided by the Jews and Romans ("watches" "A Dictionary of Phrase and Fable", ed Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. University of Hull. 19 September 2008 at [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t214.e7611]). The phrase occurs in the King James Bible ("Psalms"), and has also been used in several works of literature as a cliché for what is also called 'the wee small hours', or 'the early morning', often with connotations of blackness (both of night and of the spirits) and depression (e. g. Longfellow wrote in "The Cross of Snow" (1879) "In the long, sleepless watches of the night"). Kipling uses this, along with a pun on the word 'watches': the story turns on two identical timepieces.
Both the Colonel, commanding the regiment, and a Subaltern in the Regiment, Platte, a poor man, own Waterbury watches. (These are fob or Pocket watches, not wrist watches: Each usually hangs from a chain.) The Waterbury (from the town of Waterbury, Connecticut is a mass-produced and not especially prestigious make. The Colonel, who affects to be "a horsey man" (but is not) wears his watch, not on a chain, but on a leather strap made from the lip-strap of a horse's harness; Platte wears his from a leather guard, presumably because he can afford no better. One night the two men change - in a hurry - at the Club, and, not unnaturally, take each other's watch. They go on their separate ways. Later that night, as Platte returns home, his horse rears and upsets his cart, throwing him to the ground outside Mrs Larkyn's house, where his watch falls loose. The Colonel loses his watch, which slips on to the floor - where a native bearer finds it (and keeps it). Going home in a hired carriage, the Colonel finds the driver drunk, and returns late. His wife, who is religious (and, we have been told "manufactured the Station scandal"), is disinclined to believe him.
In the morning, Mrs Larkyn, who has been a victim of the Colonel's wife scandal-mongering, finds the watch that Platte has dropped, and shows it to him. He affects to believe it is "...disgusting! Shocking old man!". They send the Colonel's watch (which is the one Platte had been wearing) to the Colonel's wife. She attacks the Colonel, being wholly convinced of Original Sin - and begins to realise the harm and pain that unfounded suspicion can cause - and has caused her victims.
That is really the moral of the story. "The mistrust and the tragedy of it," says Kipling, "are killing the Colonel's Wife, and are making the Colonel wretched.

Vallesaurus

Vallesaurus is an extinct genus of Late Triassic elyurosaur drepanosauromorph. First found in Northern Italy in 1975, it is one of the most primitive drepanosaurs. "V. cenenis" is the type species, named in 2006. A second species, "V. zorzinensis", was named in 2010.
Nomenclature.
The first specimen of "Vallesaurus cenensis", MCSNB 4751, was found in 1975 by the staff of the Museo Civico di Scienze Naturali of Bergamo, Italy. The genus was named in respect of professor Valle, the former director of the museum. The species, on the other hand, was named after a local municipality called Cene neighbouring the site where the fossil was excavated. The specimen was given to palaeontologist Rupert Wild to study at the Staatliches Museum of Stuttgart, Germany. Wild named the genus and the type species in 1991, but without describing it formally or providing the holotype specimen. Pinna (1993) provided the holotype and described it but the name "Vallesaurus" was considered a nomen nudum. Renesto and Binelli named formally the genus and the type species in 2006.
The second species, "V. zorzinensis", was found in the same location and identified from the specimen MCSNB 4783. The specific name referred to the Zorzino Limestone Formation, where the holotype was found.
Physical Characteristics.
"Vallesaurus" is a small drepanosaurid about long. It is pentadactyl, with the 4th digit being longest and equal in length to the humerus. Its tarsus has a centrale, or an ankle bone which articulates with the tibia. In addition, "Vallesaurus" also has modified distal tarsals and metatarsals, and a clawless hallux.
"Vallesaurus" differs in some characteristics from another drepanosaur, "Megalancosaurus". "Vallesaurus" has a proportionally shorter and higher snout, a thicker and larger maxilla and set of maxillary teeth, and a shorter cervical vertebra. It also lacks the fusion between the neural spines of the second and third dorsal vertebrae. "Vallesaurus" differs from "Drepanosaurus", another drepanosaur, in that it lacks the enormous claw found on the second digit of the manus. It can be distinguished from "Drepanosaurus", "Megalancosaurus" and possibly "Dolabrosaurus" in the lack of a terminal spine at the end of the tail. In addition, "Vallesaurus" also differs from "Hypuronector", a related drepanosaur, in having anteroposteriorly extended neural spines of the anterior dorsal vertebrae and forelimbs much shorter than the hindlimbs.
Behavioral Adaptations.
"Vallesaurus" shares with all other known drepanosaurids a body structure that indicates a specialized adaptation toward climbing, especially on narrow supports such as the twigs of trees. The manus of "Vallesaurus" has no opposable fingers; however, the shape and length of the fingers suggest good climbing abilities.
"Vallesaurus" as well as other drepanosaurids possess a fussed-like structure in the anterior dorsal region and highly modified cervical vertebrae with adaptations that limited lateral mobility. Both structures indicate the presence of powerful muscles and ligaments for the extension of the neck. This possibly suggests a projectile feeding adaptation. The head was suddenly launched forward to catch prey and the limited lateral mobility prevented undesired jerks of the neck which could have dislocated the cervical vertebrae during the quick extension. In smaller drepanosaurids like "Megalancosaurus" and "Vallesaurus", such adaptations may be related to an insectivorous diet. The teeth of "Vallesaurus" seem well suited to cut or crush the tough exoskeleton of insects and other arthropods.

Beoseon

The beoseon () is a type of paired socks worn with "hanbok", Korean traditional clothing and is made for protection, warmth, and style. It is also called "jokui" (족의, ), "jokgeon" (족건, ) or "mal" (말, ) in hanja. According to a book titled "Hunmong jahoe" (훈몽자회,訓蒙字會) written by Choe Sejin (최세진,崔世珍) in 1527 during the reign of King Jungjong of the Joseon Dynasty (1392 - 1910), "beoseon" was called ""bosyeonmal"" (보션말), so it may be called by the name before the time.
It is not clear when "beoseon" first began to be worn, but ancient "beoseon" is assumed to be a form extended from a trouser or "bojagi" (wrapping clothes) for protecting the foot. During the period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BC – 668 AD), "beonseon" made of silk was worn but it was limited by social class. In the Joseon period, "beoseon" made of a white fabric was usually worn regardless of class except special occasions.
Types.
The types of "beoseon" can be varied by purpose, shape, and sewing technique. "Goteun beoseon" (곧은버선) or also called "godeulmok beoseon" (고들목버선) and "nuin beoseon" (누인버선) are defined by shape.
According to sewing technique, "beoseon" is divided into "som beoseon", "gyeop beoseon", "hot beoseon", "nubi beoseon", and "tarae beoseon". "Som beoseon" (솜버선) is composed of the outer fabric and cotton ("som" in Korean) as a batting to give foot warmth and style. "Gyeop beoseon" (겹버선) is made with two layers ("gyeop") of a fabric without stuffing the inside. "Hot beoseon" (홑버선) is made with one layer ("hot") and worn as an inner sock to prevent the outer "beoseon" from getting dirty. "Nubi beoseon" (누비버선) is made by quilting ("nubi") and usually worn for protection against the cold during winter. The "beoseon" is considered practical because of the easiness to handle after cleaning although the running stitches can be broken or it is stiff than other "beoseon". "Tarae beoseon" (타래버선) is decorative socks for children. After quilted, "tarae beosoen" is embrodered with strings in various colors, and a string is attached to each portion of ankle to bind them at the front.
Although the shape of "beoseon" does not reflect gender, "beoseon" for men have a straighter seam than that of women.

Iranian peoples

The Iranian peoples or Iranic peoples are an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group that comprise the speakers of Iranian languages, a major branch of the Indo-European language family, as such forming a branch of the Indo-European-speaking peoples. Their historical areas of settlement were on the Iranian plateau (mainly Iran, Afghanistan and Azerbaijan) and certain neighbouring areas of Asia (such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, western Pakistan, Bahrain, Oman, northern Iraq and eastern Turkey, and scattered part of the Caucasus Mountains) reflecting changing geopolitical range of the Persian empires and the Iranian history. Their current distribution spreads across the Iranian plateau, and stretches from Pakistan's Indus River in the east to eastern Turkey in the west, and from Central Asia and the Caucasus in the north to the Persian Gulf in the south – a region that is sometimes called the Iranian cultural continent, or Greater Iran by scholars, and represents the extent of the Iranian languages and influence of the Iranian peoples, through the geopolitical reach of the Iranian empire.
The Iranian group emerges from an earlier Iranian group during the Late Bronze Age, and it enters the historical record during the Early Iron Age.
The Iranians comprise the Persians, Pashtuns, Balochs, Kurds, Medes, Scythians, Bactrians, Parthians, Sarmatians, Alans, Ossetians, Cimerians, Azerbaijanis and their sub-groups. The Iranians had domesticated horses, had traveled far and wide, and from the late 2nd millennium BCE to early 1st millennium BCE they had migrated to and settled on the Iranian Plateau. They moved into the Zagros Mountains (inhabited by Gutians, Kassites, home of the Mannaean kingdom) above the indigenous non-Iranian Elamite Kingdom and intermingled with them. For approximately three centuries after arriving in the region, the Medes and Persians fell under the domination of the Assyrian Empire (911–609 BCE), based in nearby Mesopotamia. In 646 BCE, Susa and many other cities of Elam were plundered and wrecked by Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria, allowing the Iranian peoples to become the predominant group in Iran. After the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BCE, the Assyrian Empire began to unravel due to a series of bitter civil wars. In 616 BCE the Median king Cyaxares threw off the Assyrian yoke, united the Medes and Persians, and in alliance with Nabopolassar of Babylon and the Scythians, attacked the civil war ridden Assyrian Empire. By 609 BCE, the Assyrians and their Egyptian allies had been defeated. This began the Iranian domination in the Iranian Plateau. Persians formed the Achaemenid Empire by the 6th century BCE, while the Scythians dominated the Eurasian steppe. With numerous artistic, scientific, architectural and philosophical achievements and numerous kingdoms and empires that bridged much of the civilized world in antiquity, the Iranian peoples were often in close contact with the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Indians, Chinese, Turks and Arabs. The various religions of the Iranian people, including Zoroastrianism, Mithraism and Manichaeism, are believed by some scholars to have been significant early philosophical influences on Christianity and Judaism. Currently, there are over a million Iranians worldwide.
Name.
The term "Iranian" is derived from the Old Iranian ethnical adjective "Aryana" which is itself a cognate of the Sanskrit word "Arya". The name "Iran" is from "Aryānām"; lit: "of the Aryans". The old Proto-Indo-Iranian term "Arya", per Thieme meaning "hospitable", is believed to have been one of the self-referential terms used by the Aryans, at least in the areas populated by Aryans who migrated south from Central Asia. Another meaning for Aryan is "noble". In the late part of the Avesta (Vendidad 1), one of their homelands was referred to as "Airyanem Vaejah". The homeland varied in its geographic range, the area around Herat (Pliny's view) and even the entire expanse of the Iranian plateau (Strabo's designation).
The academic usage of the term "Iranian" is distinct from the state of Iran and its various citizens (who are all Iranian by nationality and thus popularly referred to as "Iranians") in the same way that "Germanic peoples" is distinct from "Germans". Many citizens of Iran are not necessarily "Iranian peoples" by virtue of not being speakers of Iranian languages.
Unlike the various terms connected with the Aryan arya- in Old Indian, the Old Iranian term has solely an ethnic meaning and there can be no doubt about the ethnic value of Old Iran. arya (Benveniste, 1969, I, pp. 369 f.; Szemerényi; Kellens).
The name Arya lives in the ethnic names like Alan, New Persian: Iran, Ossetian: Ir and Iron. The name Iran has been in usage since Sassanid times.
The Avesta clearly uses "airya" as an ethnic name (Vd. 1; Yt. 13.143-44, etc.), where it appears in expressions such as airyāfi; daiŋˊhāvō "Iranian lands, peoples," airyō.šayanəm "land inhabited by Iranians," and airyanəm vaējō vaŋhuyāfi; dāityayāfi; "Iranian stretch of the good Dāityā," the river Oxus, the modern Āmū Daryā.
The term "Ariya" appears in the royal Old Persian inscriptions in three different contexts: 1) As the name of the language of the Old Persian version of the inscription of Darius the Great in Behistun; 2) as the ethnic background of Darius in inscriptions at Naqsh-e-Rostam and Susa (Dna, Dse) and Xerxes in the inscription from Persepolis (Xph) and 3) as the definition of the God of Iranian peoples, Ahuramazda, in the Elamite version of the Behistun inscription. For example in the Dna and Dse Darius and Xerxes describe themselves as "An Achaemenian, A Persian son of a Persian and an Aryan, of Aryan stock". Although Darius the Great called his language the Iranian language, modern scholars refer to it as Old Persian because it is the ancestor of modern Persian language.
The Old Persian and Avestan evidence is confirmed by the Greek sources". Herodotus in his Histories remarks about the Iranian Medes that: "These Medes were called anciently by all people Arians; " (7.62). In Armenian sources, the Parthians, Medes and Persians are collectively referred to as Iranians. Eudemus of Rhodes apud Damascius (Dubitationes et solutiones in Platonis Parmenidem 125 bis) refers to "the Magi and all those of Iranian (áreion) lineage"; Diodorus Siculus (1.94.2) considers Zoroaster (Zathraustēs) as one of the Arianoi.
Strabo, in his "Geography", mentions the unity of Medes, Persians, Bactrians and Sogdians:
The trilingual inscription erected by Shapur's command gives a more clear description. The languages used are Parthian, Middle Persian and Greek. In Greek, the inscription says: "ego ... tou Arianon ethnous despotes eimi"("I am lord of the kingdom (Gk. nation) of the Aryans") which translates to "I am the king of the Iranian people". In the Middle Persian, Shapour states: "ērānšahr xwadāy hēm" and in Parthian he states: "aryānšahr xwadāy ahēm".
The Bactrian language (a Middle Iranian language) inscription of Kanishka the founder of the Kushan empire at Rabatak, which was discovered in 1993 in an unexcavated site in the Afghanistan province of Baghlan, clearly refers to this Eastern Iranian language as Arya.
In the post-Islamic era, one can still see a clear usage of the term Iran in the work of the 10th-century historian Hamzeh Isfahani. In his book "the history of Prophets and Kings" writes: "Aryan which is also called Pars (Persia) is in the middle of these countries and these six countries surround it because the South East is in the hands China, the North of the Turks, the middle South is India, the middle North is Rome, and the South West and the North West is the Sudan and Berber lands". All this evidence shows that the name arya "Iranian" was a collective definition, denoting peoples (Geiger, pp. 167 f.; Schmitt, 1978, p. 31) who were aware of belonging to the one ethnic stock, speaking a common language, and having a religious tradition that centered on the cult of Ahura Mazdā.
History and settlement.
Roots.
The language referred to as Proto-Indo-European (PIE): is ancestral to the Celtic, Italic (including Romance), Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, Indo-Iranian, Albanian, Armenian, Greek, and Tocharian languages.
'There is an agreement that the PIE community split into two major groups from wherever its homeland was situated (its location is unknown), and whenever the timing of its dispersal (also unknown). One headed west for Europe and became speakers of Indo-European (all the languages of modern Europe save for Basque, Hungarian, Estonian, and Finnish) while others headed east for Eurasia to become Indo-Iranians. The Indo-Iranians were a community that spoke a common language prior to their branching off into the Iranian and Indo-Aryan languages. Iranian refers to the languages of Iran (Iranian), parts of Pakistan (Balochi and Pashto), Afghanistan (Pashto and Dari), and Tadjikistan (Tajiki) and Indo-Aryan, Sanskrit, Urdu and its many related languages.' – (Carl C. Lamberg-Karlovsky: Case of the Bronze Age)
By the early 1st millennium, Ancient Iranian peoples such as Medes, Persians, Bactrians, Parthians and Scythians populated the Iranian plateau, and other Scythian tribes, along with Cimmerians, Sarmatians and Alans populated the steppes north of the Black Sea. The Saka, Scythian, tribes spread as far west as the Balkans and as far east as Xinjiang. Scythians as well formed the Indo-Scythian Empire, and Bactrians formed a Greco-Bactrian Kingdom founded by Diodotus I, the satrap of Bactria. The Kushan Empire, with Bactrian roots/connections, once controlled much of Pakistan, some of Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The Kushan elite (who the Chinese called the Yuezhi) were either a Tocharian-speaking (another Indo-European branch) people or an Eastern Iranian language-speaking people.
The division into an "Eastern" and a "Western" group by the early 1st millennium is visible in Avestan vs. Old Persian, the two oldest known Iranian languages. The Old Avestan texts known as the Gathas are believed to have been composed by Zoroaster, the founder of Zoroastrianism, with the Yaz culture (c. 1500 BCE – 1100 BCE) as a candidate for the development of Eastern Iranian culture.
Old Persian appears to have been established in written form by 519 BCE, following the creation of the Old Persian script, inspired by the cuneiform script of the Assyrians.
Western Iranian peoples.
During the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, the ancient Persians established themselves in the western portion of the Iranian plateau and appear to have interacted considerably with the Elamites and Babylonians, while the Medes also entered in contact with the Assyrians. Remnants of the Median language and Old Persian show their common Proto-Iranian roots, emphasized in Strabo and Herodotus' description of their languages as very similar to the languages spoken by the Bactrians and Soghdians in the east. Following the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire, the Persian language (referred to as ""Farsi"" in Persian) spread from Pars or Fars Province to various regions of the Empire, with the modern dialects of Iran, Afghanistan (also known as Dari) and Central-Asia (known as Tajiki) descending from Old Persian.
Old Persian is attested in the Behistun Inscription (c. 519 BCE), recording a proclamation by Darius the Great. In southwestern Iran, the Achaemenid kings usually wrote their inscriptions in trilingual form (Elamite, Babylonian and Old Persian) while elsewhere other languages were used. The administrative languages were Elamite in the early period, and later Imperial Aramaic.
The early inhabitants of the Achaemenid Empire appear to have adopted the religion of Zoroastrianism. The Baloch who speak a west Iranian language relate an oral tradition regarding their migration from Aleppo, Syria around the year 1000 CE, whereas linguistic evidence links Balochi to Kurmanji, Soranî, Gorani and Zazaki.
Eastern Iranian peoples.
While the Iranian tribes of the south are better known through their texts and modern counterparts, the tribes which remained largely in the vast Eurasian expanse are known through the references made to them by the ancient Greeks, Persians, Indo-Aryans as well as by archaeological finds. Many ancient Sanskrit texts make references to tribes like Sakas, Paradas, Kambojas, Bahlikas, Uttaramadras, Madras, Lohas, Parama Kambojas, Rishikas, Tukharas or Tusharas etc. and locate them in the (Uttarapatha) (north-west) division, in Central Asia, around Hindukush range in northern Pakistan. The Greek chronicler, Herodotus (5th century BCE) makes references to a nomadic people, the Scythians; he describes them as having dwelt in what is today southern Russia.
It is believed that these Scythians were conquered by their eastern cousins, the Sarmatians, who are mentioned by Strabo as the dominant tribe which controlled the southern Russian steppe in the 1st millennium CE. These Sarmatians were also known to the Romans, who conquered the western tribes in the Balkans and sent Sarmatian conscripts, as part of Roman legions, as far west as Roman Britain.
The Sarmatians of the east became the Alans, who also ventured far and wide, with a branch ending up in Western Europe and North Africa, as they accompanied the Germanic Vandals during their migrations. The modern Ossetians are believed to be the sole direct descendants of the Alans, as other remnants of the Alans disappeared following Germanic, Hunnic and ultimately Slavic migrations and invasions.
Another group of Alans allied with Goths to defeat the Romans and ultimately settled in what is now called Catalonia (Goth-Alania).
Some of the Saka-Scythian tribes in Central Asia would later move further southeast and invade the Iranian plateau, large sections of present day Afghanistan and finally deep into present day Pakistan (see Indo-Scythians). Another Iranian tribe related to the Saka-Scythians were the Parni in Central Asia, and who later become indistinguishable from the Parthians, speakers of a northwest-Iranian language. Many Iranian tribes, including the Khwarazmians, Massagetae and Sogdians, were assimilated and/or displaced in Central Asia by the migrations of Turkic tribes emanating out of Xinjiang and Siberia.
The most dominant surviving Eastern Iranian peoples are represented by the Pashtuns, whose origins are generally believed to be from the province of Ghor, from which they began to spread until they reached as far west as Herat, north to areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan; and as eastward towards the Indus. The Pashto language shows affinities to the Avestan and Bactrian.
The modern Sarikoli in southern Xinjiang and the Ossetians of the Caucasus are remnants of the various Saka tribes. The modern Ossetians claim to be the descendants of the Alano-Sarmatians and their claims are supported by their Northeast Iranian language, while culturally the Ossetians resemble their Caucasian neighbors, the Kabardians and Circassians. Various extinct Iranian peoples existed in the eastern Caucasus, including the Azaris, while some Iranian peoples remain in the region, including the Talysh and the Tats (including the Judeo-Tats, who have relocated to Israel), found in Azerbaijan and as far north as the Russian republic of Dagestan. A remnant of the Sogdians is found in the Yaghnobi speaking population in parts of the Zeravshan valley in Tajikistan.
Later developments.
Starting with the reign of Omar in 634 CE, Muslim Arabs began a conquest of the Iranian plateau. The Arabs conquered the Sassanid Empire of the Persians and seized much of the Byzantine Empire populated by the Kurds and others. Ultimately, the various Iranian peoples, including the Persians, Pashtuns, Kurds and Balochis, converted to Islam. The Iranian peoples would later split along sectarian lines as the Persians (and later the Hazara) adopted the Shi'a sect. As ancient tribes and identities changed, so did the Iranian peoples, many of whom assimilated foreign cultures and peoples.
Later, during the 2nd millennium CE, the Iranian peoples would play a prominent role during the age of Islamic expansion and empire. Saladin, a noted adversary of the Crusaders, was an ethnic Kurd, while various empires centered in Iran (including the Safavids) re-established a modern dialect of Persian as the official language spoken throughout much of what is today Iran and adjacent parts of Central Asia. Iranian influence spread to the Ottoman Empire, where Persian was often spoken at court, as well to the court of the Mughal Empire. All of the major Iranian peoples reasserted their use of Iranian languages following the decline of Arab rule, but would not begin to form modern national identities until the 19th and early 20th centuries (just as Germans and Italians were beginning to formulate national identities of their own).
The following either partially descend from Iranian peoples or are sometimes regarded as possible descendants of ancient Iranian peoples:
Demographics.
There are an estimated 150 to 200 million native speakers of Iranian languages, the five major groups of Persians, Lurs, Kurds, Baloch, and Pashtuns accounting for about 90% of this number. Currently, most of these Iranian peoples live in Iran, Afghanistan, the Caucasus (mainly Ossetia, other parts of Georgia, and Azerbaijan), Iraqi Kurdistan and Kurdish majority populated areas of Turkey, Iran and Syria, Tajikistan, Pakistan, also Uzbekistan. There are also Iranian peoples living in Eastern Arabia such as northern Oman and Bahrain. 
Due to recent migrations, there are also large communities of speakers of Iranian languages in Europe, the Americas, and Israel.
The following is a list of peoples that speak Iranian languages with the respective groups's core areas of settlements and their estimated sizes (in millions):
Diversity.
It is largely through linguistic similarities that the Iranian peoples have been linked, as many non-Iranian peoples have adopted Iranian languages and cultures. However, other common traits have been identified as well, for example, a stream of common historical events have often linked the southern Iranian peoples, including Hellenistic conquests, the various empires based in Persia, Arab Caliphates and Turkic invasions.
Culture.
Like other Indo-Europeans, the early Iranians practiced ritual sacrifice, had a social hierarchy consisting of warriors, clerics and farmers and poetic hymns and sagas to recount their deeds.
Following the Iranian split from the Indo-Iranians, the Iranians developed an increasingly distinct culture. Various common traits can be discerned among the Iranian peoples. For example, the social event Norouz is an Iranian festival that is practiced by nearly all of the Iranian peoples as well as others in the region. Its origins are traced to Zoroastrianism and pre-historic times.
Some Iranian cultures exhibit traits that are unique unto themselves. The Pashtuns adhere to a code of honor and culture known as Pashtunwali, which has a similar counterpart among the Baloch, called Mayar, that is more hierarchical.
Religion.
The early Iranian peoples worshipped various deities found throughout other cultures where Indo-European immigrants established themselves. The earliest major religion of the Iranian peoples was Zoroastrianism, which spread to nearly all of the Iranian peoples living in the Iranian plateau. Other religions that had their origins in the Iranian world were Mithraism, Manichaeism, and Mazdakism, among others.
Modern speakers of Iranian languages mainly follow Islam. Some follow Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and the Bahá'í Faith, with an unknown number showing no religious affiliation. Overall the numbers of Sunni and Shia among the Iranian peoples are equally distributed. Most Kurds, Tajiks, Pashtuns, and Baloch are Sunni Muslims, while the remainder are mainly Twelver Shi'a, comprising mostly Persians in Iran, and Hazaras in Afghanistan. Zazas in Turkey are largely Alevi, while the Pamiri peoples in Tajikistan and China are nearly all Ismaili. The Christian community is mainly represented by the Armenian Apostolic Church, followed by the Russian Orthodox and Georgian Orthodox Ossetians followed by Nestorians. Judaism is followed mainly by Persian Jews, Kurdish Jews, Bukharian Jews (of Central Asia) and the Mountain Jews (of the Caucasus), most of whom are now found in Israel. The historical religion of the Persian Empire was Zoroastrianism and it still has a few thousand followers, mostly in Yazd and Kerman. They are known as the Parsis in the Indian subcontinent, where many of them fled in historic times following the Arab conquest of Persia, or Zoroastrians in Iran. Another ancient religion is the Yazidi faith, followed by some Kurds in northern Iraq, as well as the majority of the Kurds in Armenia.
Elements of pre-Islamic Zoroastrian and shamanistic beliefs persist among some Islamized groups today, such as the Tajiks, Pashtuns and Pamiri peoples.
Cultural assimilation.
In matters relating to culture, the various Turkic-speaking ethnic groups of Iran (notably the Azerbaijani people) and Afghanistan (Uzbeks and Turkmen) are often conversant in Iranian languages, in addition to their own Turkic languages and also have Iranian culture to the extent that the term "Turko-Iranian" can be applied. The usage applies to various circumstances that involve historic interaction, intermarriage, cultural assimilation, bilingualism and cultural overlap or commonalities.
Notable among this synthesis of Turko-Iranian culture are the Azeris, whose culture, religion and significant periods of history are linked to the Persians. Certain theories and genetic tests suggest that the Azeris are genetically more Iranian than Turkic.
Genetics.
Regueiro "et al" (2006) and Grugni "et al" (2012) have performed large-scale sampling of different ethnic groups "within Iran". They found that the most common Haplogroups were:
Two large – scale papers by Haber (2012) and Di Cristofaro (2013) analyzed populations from Afghanistan, where several Iranian-speaking groups are native. They found that different groups (e.g. Baluch, Hazara, Pashtun) were quite diverse, yet overall:
Internal diversity and distant affinities.
Overall, Iranian-speaking populations are characterized by high internal diversity. For Afghanistan, "It is possibly due to the strategic location of this region and its unique harsh geography of mountains, deserts and steppes, which could have facilitated the establishment of social organizations within expanding populations, and helped maintaining genetic boundaries among groups that have developed over time into distinct ethnicities" as well as the "high level of endogamy practiced by these groups". The data ultimately suggests that Afghanistan, like other northern-central Asian regions, has continually been the recipient rather than a source of gene flow. Although, populations from Iran proper are also diverse, J2a-M530 likely spread out of Iran, and constitutes a common genetic substratum for all Iranian populations, which was then modified by further differential gene flows. In Iran, language was a greater determinant of genetic similarity between different groups, whereas in Afghanistan and other areas of northern central Asia, this was not the case.
Overall, whether in Iran or Afghanistan, Iranian population groups do not do not form tight clusters either according to language or region. Rather, they occupy intermediate positions among Arab, Near Easterns and Asian clusters. Some of the Iranian groups lie within the Near Eastern group, but none fell into the Arab or Asian groups. Iranians are only distantly related to Europeans, and then, predominantly with Southern Europeans like Greeks and Sardinians rather than central Europeans like Croatians, Poles or Slovaks.[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0041252] Nevertheless, Iranian-speaking Central Asians do show closer affinity to Europeans than do Turkic-speaking Central Asians.

Joshua Winstead

Joshua "Josh" Winstead is an American songwriter and musician. He is the bassist and synth player of the Canadian indie rock band Metric, as well as the lead singer and guitarist of the indie rock group Bang Lime.
Life and career.
Winstead is from El Paso, Texas, where he first began playing guitar. Winstead and Joules Scott-Key (drummer for Metric and Bang Lime) both went to the University of Texas, where they played in a number of bands together starting in 1991. One of these bands was 53 Large Men, who released an album titled "Period of Senselessness". The two moved to New York City together, where they played in another band called The Death of Death.
Scott-key was soon invited to join Metric, and Winstead subsequently joined. This was Winstead's first bass playing experience, but since he had been playing with Scott-Key for so many years they quickly became a very tight rhythm section.
Having written a lot of 1960s-driven music, Winstead teamed up with Scott-Key to form the Oakland-based band Bang Lime. Bang Lime's debut album, released in 2007, is titled "Best Friends in Love", and is said to possess elements of indie rock, dance-rock, post-punk, and "dirty" rock & roll. The first single/video of the album is titled "The Death Of Death," an homage to their short-lived former band.

Kann's

S. Kann Sons Co., or more commonly Kann's was a department store based in Washington, D.C.. It was the District's second department store and pioneered the one-price policy and "the customer is always right" concept in retailing on the Washington, D.C. retail scene. The stores allowed consumers to return goods for cash.
History.
The company was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1893, by Louis, Solomon, and Sigmund Kann. The Baltimore family originally came to Washington in 1890, to liquidate Abe Kaufman's store at 909 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, and returned to establish a permanent business. The store remained family owned until 1971, when it was sold to L. S. Good and Co. of Wheeling, West Virginia. The company closed in 1975. 
Flagship store.
The main store of S. Kann Sons Co. was located at 8th Street and Market Place, N.W., at Pennsylvania Avenue. After founding at this location in 1893, the company expanded into neighboring storefronts until 1913, when it embarked on a major expansion to four stories and creation of a public dining room. In 1959, the company received approval from the Fine Arts Commission, to integrate its disparate 19th Century storefronts with anodized aluminum sheeting, as part of a $500,000 renovation and modernization project. After its closing in 1975, the store remained vacant until purchased for $4.275 million in 1978, by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC). The PADC purchased the site for redevelopment as housing. On March 31, 1979, a fire at the flagship store resulted in its immediate demolition. At a hearing before the U.S. Senate, D.C. fire marshal Carmel Del Bazo reported to Senator Patrick Leahy that "the possibility of an accidental cause of the fire is excluded." After demolition, the site immediately across from the National Archives Building remained vacant until redeveloped as Market Square in the early 1990s.
Virginia Square store.
Kann's was the second Washington D.C. based department store chain to open a suburban location in nearby Northern Virginia. Just two weeks after the Hecht Company opened its store at Parkington Shopping Center, on November 16, 1951, Kann's opened its store at N. Fairfax Drive and N. Kirkwood Rd., in Arlington County, Virginia. The $4.5 million, 3 story store, known as Kann's Virginia, opened in conjunction with the neighboring Virginia Square Shopping Center. At opening, the store featured imported Squirrel Monkeys from Brazil named Teeny, Weeny, Eeny, and Miney to entertain children in the shoe department; a package assembly system using conveyor belts; "Kannteen" restaurant; customer lounge; and hospital room with nurse in attendance. After closing in 1975, the store was acquired in 1979, by George Mason University, who used it for their Arlington Campus. The building was used first for the law school and later for the School of Public Policy. Current plans are for the building to be eventually demolished. However it remains standing as of 2013.

Parthia

Parthia (, Parθava, , Parθaw, , Pahlaw) is a historical region located in north-eastern Iran, best known for having been the political and cultural base of the Arsacid dynasty, rulers of the Parthian Empire. 
The name "Parthia" is a continuation from Latin ', from Old Persian ', which was the Parthian language self-designator signifying "of the Parthians" who were an Iranian people. In context to its Hellenistic period "Parthia" also appears as "Parthyaea".
Geography.
Parthia roughly corresponds to region in northeastern Iran. It was bordered by the Karakum desert in the north, included Kopet Dag mountain range and the Dasht-e-Kavir desert in the south. It bordered Media on the west, Hyrcania on the north west, Margiana on the north east, and Aria on the south east.
During Arsacid times, Parthia was united with Hyrcania as one administrative unit, and that region is therefore often (subject to context) considered a part of Parthia proper.
History.
Under the Achaemenids.
As the region inhabited by Parthians, Parthia first appears as a political entity in Achaemenid lists of governorates ("satrapies") under their dominion. Prior to this, the people of the region seem to have been subjects of the Medes, and 7th century BC Assyrian texts mention a country named Partakka or Partukka (though this "need not have coincided topographically with the later Parthia").
A year after Cyrus the Great's defeat of the Median Astyages, Parthia became one of the first provinces to acknowledge Cyrus as their ruler, "and this allegiance secured Cyrus' eastern flanks and enabled him to conduct the first of his imperial campaigns – against Sardis." According to Greek sources, following the seizure of the Achaemenid throne by Darius I, the Parthians united with the Median king Phraortes to revolt against him. Hystaspes, the Achaemenid governor of the province (said to be father of Darius I), managed to suppress the revolt, which seems to have occurred around 522–521 BC.
The first indigenous Iranian mention of Parthia is in the Behistun inscription of Darius I, where Parthia is listed (in the typical Iranian clockwise order) among the governorates in the vicinity of Drangiana. The inscription dates to c. 520 BC. The center of the administration "may have been at would later be known as Hecatompylus". The Parthians also appear in Herodotus' list of peoples subject to the Achaemenids; the historiographer treats the Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians and Areioi as peoples of a single satrapy (the 16th), whose annual tribute to the king he states to be only 300 talents of silver. This "has rightly caused disquiet to modern scholars."
At the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC between the forces of Darius III and those of Alexander the Great, one such Parthian unit was commanded by Phrataphernes, who was at the time Achaemenid governor of Parthia. Following the defeat of Darius III, Phrataphernes surrendered his governorate to Alexander when the Macedonian arrived there in the summer of 330 BC. Phrataphernes was reappointed governor by Alexander.
Under the Seleucids.
Following the death of Alexander, in the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC, Parthia became a Seleucid governorate under Nicanor. Phrataphernes, the former governor, became governor of Hyrcania. In 320 BC, at the Partition of Triparadisus, Parthia was reassigned to Philip, former governor of Sogdiana. A few years later, the province was invaded by Peithon, governor of Media Magna, who then attempted to make his brother Eudamus governor. Peithon and Eudamus were driven back, and Parthia remained a governorate in its own right.
In 316 BC, Stasander, a vassal of Seleucus I Nicator and governor of Bactria (and, it seems, also of Aria and Margiana) was appointed governor of Parthia. For the next 60 years, various Seleucids would be appointed governors of the province.
In 247 BC, following the death of Antiochus II, Ptolemy III seized control of the Seleucid capital at Antioch, and "so left the future of the Seleucid dynasty for a moment in question." Taking advantage of the uncertain political situation, Andragoras, the Seleucid governor of Parthia, proclaimed his independence and began minting his own coins.
Meanwhile, "a man called Arsaces, of Scythian or Bactrian origin, elected leader of the Parni", an eastern-Iranian peoples from the Tajen/Tajend River valley, south-east of the Caspian Sea. Following the secession of Parthia from the Seleucid Empire and the resultant loss of Seleucid military support, Andragoras had difficulty in maintaining his borders, and about 238 BC – under the command of "Arsaces and his brother Tiridates" – the Parni invaded Parthia and seized control of Astabene (Astawa), the northern region of that territory, the administrative capital of which was Kabuchan (Kuchan in the vulgate).
A short while later the Parni seized the rest of Parthia from Andragoras, killing him in the process. Although an initial punitive expedition by the Seleucids under Seleucus II was not successful, the Seleucids under Antiochus III recaptured Arsacid controlled territory in 209 BC from Arsaces' (or Tiridates') successor, Arsaces II. Arsaces II sued for peace and accepted vassal status, and it was not until Arsaces II's grandson (or grand-nephew) Phraates I, that the Arsacids/Parni would again begin to assert their independence.
Under the Arsacids.
(R. 171–138 BC). The reverse shows Heracles, and the inscription "Great King Arsaces, friend of Greeks".
From their base in Parthia, the Arsacid dynasts eventually extended their dominion to include most of Greater Iran. Even though the Arsacids only sporadically had their capital in Parthia, their power base was there, among the Parthian feudal families, upon whose military and financial support the Arsacids depended. In exchange for this support, these families received large tracts of land among the earliest conquered territories adjacent to Parthia, which the Parthian nobility then ruled as provincial rulers. The largest of these city-states were Kuchan, Semnan, Gorgan, Merv, Zabol and Yazd.
From about 105 BC onwards, the power and influence of this handful of Parthian noble families was such that they frequently opposed the monarch, and would eventually be a "contributory factor in the downfall" of the dynasty.
From about 130 BC onwards, Parthia suffered numerous incursions by various nomadic tribes, including the Sakas, the Yueh-chi, and the Massagetae. Each time, the Arsacid dynasts responded personally, doing so even when there were more severe threats from Seleucids or Romans looming on the western borders of their empire (as was the case for Mithridates I). Defending the empire against the nomads cost Phraates II and Artabanus I their lives.
Around 32 BC, civil war broke out when a certain Tiridates rebelled against Phraates IV, probably with the support of the nobility that Phraates had previously persecuted. The revolt was initially successful, but failed by 25 BC. In 9/8, the Parthian nobility succeeded in putting their preferred king on the throne, but Vonones proved to have too tight a budgetary control, so he was usurped in favor of Artabanus II, who seems to have been a non-Arsacid Parthian nobleman. But when Artabanus attempted to consolidate his position (at which he was successful in most instances), he failed to do so in the regions where the Parthian provincial rulers held sway.
By the 2nd century AD, the wars with Rome and with the nomads, and the infighting among the Parthian nobility had weakened the Arsacids to a point where they could no longer defend their subjugated territories. The empire fractured as vassalaries increasingly claimed independence or were subjugated by others, and the Arsacids were themselves finally vanquished by the Persian Sassanids, a formerly minor vassal from southwestern Iran, in April 224.
Under the Sassanids.
Under Sassanid rule, Parthia was folded into a newly formed province, Khorasan, and henceforth ceased to exist as a political entity. Some of the Parthian nobility continued to resist Sassanid dominion for some time, but most switched their allegiance to the Sassanids very early. Several families that claimed descent from the Parthian noble families became a Sassanid institution known as the "Seven houses", five of which are "in all probability" not Parthian, but contrived genealogies "in order to emphasize the antiquity of their families."
Language and literature.
The Parthians spoke Parthian, a north-western Iranian language. No Parthian literature survives from before the Sassanid period in its original form, and they seem to have written down only very little. The Parthians did, however, have a thriving oral minstrel-poet culture, to the extent that their word for minstrel – "gosan" – survives to this day in many Iranian languages as well as in Armenian ("gusan"). These professionals were evident in every facet of Parthian daily life, from cradle to grave, and they were entertainers of kings and commoners alike, proclaiming the worthiness of their patrons through association with mythical heroes and rulers. These Parthian heroic poems, "mainly known through Persian of the lost Middle Persian "Xwaday-namag", and notably through Firdausi's "Shahnameh", doubtless not yet wholly lost in the Khurasan of [Firdausi's day."
In Parthia itself, attested use of written Parthian is limited to the nearly 3,000 ostraca found (in what seems to have been a wine storage) at Nisa, in present-day Turkmenistan. A handful of other evidence of written Parthian have also been found outside Parthia; the most important of these being the part of a land-sale document found at Avroman (in the Kermanshah province of Iran), and more ostraca, graffiti and the fragment of a business letter found at Dura-Europos in present-day Syria.
The Parthian Arsacids do not seem to have used Parthian until relatively late, and the language first appears on Arsacid coinage during the reign of Vologases I (51–58 AD). Evidence that use of Parthian was nonetheless widespread comes from early Sassanid times; the declarations of the early Persian kings were – in addition to their native Middle Persian – also inscribed in Parthian.
Society.
City-states of "some considerable size" existed in Parthia as early as the 1st millennium BC, "and not just from the time of the Achaemenids or Seleucids." However, for the most part, society was rural, and dominated by large landholders with large numbers of serfs, slaves, and other indentured labor at their disposal. Communities with free peasants also existed.
By Arsacid times, Parthian society was divided into the four classes (limited to freemen). At the top were the kings and near family members of the king. These were followed by the lesser nobility and the general priesthood, followed by the mercantile class and lower-ranking civil servants, and with farmers and herdsmen at the bottom.
Little is known of the Parthian economy, but agriculture must have played the most important role in it. Significant trade first occurs with the establishment of the Silk road in 114 BC, when Hecatompylos became an important junction.
Parthian cities.
Nisa (Nissa, Nusay) one of the earliest capitals of the Parthian Empire (c. 250 BC). The city is located in the northern foothills of the Kopetdag mountains, near present day Ashgabat city (capital of Turkmenistan). Nisa had a royal and temple complexes used by early Arsaces dynasty. During the reign of Mithridates I of Parthia (c. 171 BC–138 BC) it was renamed "Mithradatkirt" ("fortress of Mithradates").

Temple of Kalabsha

The Temple of Kalabsha (also Temple of Mandulis) is an Ancient Egyptian temple that was originally located at Bab al-Kalabsha (Gate of Kalabsha), approximately 50 km south of Aswan. The temple was situated on the west bank of the Nile River, in Nubia, and was originally built around 30 BC during the early Roman era. While the temple was constructed in Augustus's reign, it was never finished. The temple was a tribute to Mandulis (Merul), a Lower Nubian sun god. It was constructed over an earlier sanctuary of Amenhotep II. The temple is 76 m long and 22 m wide in dimension. While the structure dates to the Roman period, it features many fine reliefs such as "a fine carving of Horus emerging from reeds on the inner curtain wall" of the temple. From Kalabsha's "sanctuary chambers, a staircase leads up to the roof of the temple" where one can see a splendid view of the temple itself and the sacred lake. Several historical records were inscribed on the temple walls of Kalabsha such as "a long inscription carved by the Roman Governor Aurelius Besarion in AD 250, forbidding pigs in the temple" as well as an inscription of "the Nubian king Silko, carved during the 5th century and recording his victory over the Blemmyes and a picture of him dressed as a Roman soldier on horseback." Silko was the Christian king of the Nubian kingdom of Nobatia.
Later use and movement of the temples.
When Christianity was introduced to Egypt, the temple was used as a church.
With help from Germany, the temple of Kalabsha was relocated after the Aswan High Dam was built, to protect it from rising waters on Lake Nasser. The temple was moved to a site, located just south of the Aswan High Dam. The process of moving the temple took more than two years. The temple of Kalabsha was the largest free-standing temple of Egyptian Nubia (after Abu Simbel) to be moved and erected at a new site. Although the building was never completed, it "is regarded as one of the best examples of Egyptian architecture in Nubia."

The Union Credit Union is a credit union chartered to serve union members. A national advocate for unions and union members, it is headquartered in Spokane, Washington, USA. 
In 1968 members of Bricklayers Local 3 founded The Union Credit Union as a not-for-profit means of obtaining loans and saving money. The credit union served only trade union members and was named Inland Empire Trades Credit Union. Today members from any union can belong and bank at The Union Credit Union. The families of union members, union employers and unions can also hold accounts and obtain loans at The Union Credit Union. 
The Union Credit Union received media attention in 2008 for a series of advertisements using the phrase "It just works for me" without a logo or name attached.
Advocacy.
The credit union's mission is to provide union members with a not-for-profit banking alternative. The Union Credit Union is the only remaining credit union in the United States run by an all union staff, board and management. The credit union has positioned itself as an advocate against union-affiliated credit unions merging into community chartered credit unions resulting in the loss of services to union members. 
Employees.
The Union Credit Union has an all union staff, all union volunteer board of directors and the CEO is also a union member. Demaris Krummel is the CEO of The Union Credit Union.
Services.
The Union Credit Union allows union members to skip loan payments during difficult times, including union strike. Members can obtain Step-Up Loans for tools, job training or college. The credit union also handles payroll for union shops.

Love Lockdown

"Love Lockdown" is a song by American hip hop artist Kanye West, released September 18, 2008 as the lead single of his studio album "808s & Heartbreak". Written and produced by West and musician Jeff Bhasker, it was premiered by West at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards prior to its release as a single. Primarily a minimal pop song, "Love Lockdown" contains elements of synthpop and electronic music, and is characterized by the Roland TR-808 drum machine and auto-tune vocals sung by West.
Despite being a drastic departure from his previous work, the song was well received by critics, and was frequently cited as a highlight of the album. "Time" magazine critic Josh Tyrangiel named "Love Lockdown" the best song of 2008. The single was also successful commercially, as it managed to debut at number three on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 and went on to sell over three million copies. 
Background.
Kanye West debuted "Love Lockdown" on September 7, 2008, as the closing performance of the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. On September 18, he released it as the lead single of "808s & Heartbreak". After announcing it as the album's first single, West posted free copies of the song on his blog for fans to download. A week later, he also posted six downloadable stems, each featuring isolated song portions of "Love Lockdown", on his blog, with the intention of enabling fans to freely remix the song for themselves. These portions include an a cappella, distorted background vocals, 808, percussion, piano, and the outro synth-beat. The song is featured in the first episode edition of "" on the in-game contemporary hip-hop radio station, The Beat 102.7 hosted by DJ Green Lantern.
Music and structure.
Inspired by 1980s synth-pop icons such as Phil Collins, Gary Numan, and Boy George, "Love Lockdown," much like "808s" as a whole, is composed as a brooding, electronic-tinged pop song sung by West using the auto-tune effect and produced with the Roland TR-808 drum machine. The song is composed in the key of C#minor, written in common time and moves at 119.5 beats per minute. West's monotone vocal range for the song spans nearly two octaves, from G#2 to G#4. It is written in a verse-chorus form that expresses quiet-loud dynamics, featuring verses delivered in a low, somber tone before shifting into loud, chanting choruses. 
Going further against the typical sound of hip hop beat, along with the 808, the track instead makes use of tribal drums for its instrumentation. West stated his intention was to juxtapose the mechanical sounds of the auto-tune and 808s with the more traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks. The song is minimal in nature, retaining a steady bassline before building into more layered sounds within the chorus.
Chart performance.
In the United States, "Billboard" confirmed that "Love Lockdown" sold 213,000 digital downloads in only four full days of release, therefore earning itself the title of a "Hot Shot Debut" at number three on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and a "Hot Shot Debut" on the Pop 100 at number thirteen, where it eventually reached the eighth spot in early January. It is the highest debut of West's career, and was the second highest debut on the Hot 100 of 2008, tied with David Cook's "The Time of My Life." "Love Lockdown" is also only the tenth song of the decade to debut in the top three, and only the second by an artist unaffiliated with "American Idol". The single also made a "Hot Shot Debut" at number five on the Canadian Hot 100.
In Europe, "Love Lockdown" peaked at number eight the UK Singles Chart and at number four on the Irish Singles Chart. It also debuted at thirty-eight in Italy and thirty-nine in Sweden. In Australia, the song debuted in its first week at thirty-seven on the ARIA Charts and peaked at number eighteen. In New Zealand, it has peaked at the eleventh spot on the RIANZ chart. On the German Singles Chart, "Love Lockdown" debuted at number eight, giving West his first top ten and highest charting single in Germany to date.
Music video.
The music video for "Love Lockdown" was directed by Simon Henwood and premiered on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" on Tuesday, October 7, 2008. On BET J, the video appeared at #32 on the "Last Call 2008! Top 50 Countdown". It was filmed in West's apartment and features him in an all-white room, also dressed in white singing the verses of the song. West claims he drew inspiration from Christian Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman in Mary Harron's 2000 film adaptation of the novel "American Psycho", a homage that is echoed in the presentation of the video's interiors, which mirror Bateman's New York City apartment in the film. During the song's choruses, African tribe members appear, beating on djembe drums to the rhythm of song. More and more tribal members are shown with each chorus, and near the end, two very tall female figures covered with body paint decorated with abstract tattoo patterns reminiscent of the Nazca Lines appear. Interspersed throughout the video are visuals of what appears to be a spacecraft. The video ends with West laying in fetal position on the couch in the white room, in a homage to "".
The video was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, Best Hip-Hop Video, and Best Special Effects in a Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. It did not win any of the nominations.

Lacto-2 RNA motif

The lacto-2 RNA motif is an RNA structure that is conserved amongst bacteria within the order Lactobacillales. The motif consists of a stem-loop whose stem is interrupted by many internal loops and bulges. Nucleotide identities in many places are conserved, and one internal loop in particular is highly conserved. 
As lacto-2 RNAs are not consistently located in 5' UTRs, they are presumed to correspond to non-coding RNAs. However, most (80%) of the RNAs are in a position that may correspond to the 5' UTR, so it is not inconceivable that the RNA has a role as a cis-regulatory element. Many lacto-2 RNAs are present in operons that encode tRNAs and rRNAs, and many are adjacent to genes encoding protein subunits of the ribosome, although they are not necessarily in the same operon as these protein-coding genes. Lacto-2 RNAs also have a weak association with genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and transport, including several independent genes within the de-novo purine biosynthesis pathway and some in pyrimidine biosynthesis.

Not much is known of his life. He was born in Calzada de Calatrava and was a Dominican friar in the convent of Santa Cruz de Segovia, one of the oldest Dominican foundations. His surname "Cerratense" may derive from the fact that he wrote his works in the monastery of San Pelayo de Cerrato.
He lived during the reign of Alfonso X and wrote around 1276 several "Vitas sanctorum", an important hagiography that concerns various Spanish saints, including the Seven Apostolic Men. This version conserves various summaries or expansions of the biographies of the saints. 
The book ends with a very short "Chronicon" ("Crónicon"), or chronicle, which runs from the birth of Christ to the death of Ferdinand III of Castile. The "Crónicon" corrects some dates found in the "Anales toledanos", or Toledan annals. The first reference to Rodrigo de Cerrato dates from 1259 and he must have lived until 1276, which is based on an interpretation of "Crónicon" by Fidel Fita.

Michelino Molinari da Besozzo

Michelino Molinari da Besozzo (c. 1370 – c. 1455) was an Italian painter and illuminator. He worked mostly in Milan and Lombardy.
Biography.
A native of Besozzo, in 1388 he worked in the second cloister of the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia, where he frescoed the "Scenes of the Life of St. Augustine". In 1395-1405 he executed the miniatures for a breviary, currently housed in the Library of Avignon in France. A drawing of the "Nativity" (now in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana of Milan) dates to the same period. Other four saints on different parchments, from another breviary, owned by the Cabinet des Dessins of the Louvre Museum, Paris (1390–1400).
The first dated work from the artist is a miniature with the "Funerary Eulogy of Gian Galeazzo Visconti" (1403). Michelino worked in the Veneto from 1404 to c. 1418. In 1410 he is mentioned in Venice together with Gentile da Fabriano.
In 1414, together with other Veneto illuminators, he worked at the Cornaro Codex. The panel of the "Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherine", signed "Michelinus feci" and housed in the National Gallery of Siena, dates to c. 1420. Another known panel from him is the "Marriage of the Virgin" now at the Metropolitan Museum of New York, USA (c. 1435). Less precise is the dating of the "Offiziolo Bodmer", another breviary.
In 1418 he returned to Milan to work in the construction of the city's Duomo. In 1421 he was paid for the altar entitled to Saints Quiricus and Julietta, together with his son Leonardo. Another commission given to Michelino were the drawings for the stained glasses of St. Julietta (1423–1425). A fresco depicting the "Madonna with Child" from c. 1430 is in the Abbey of Viboldone, while the "Madonna of the Rose Garden" (attributed by some to Stefano da Verona) is from c. 1435.
Michelino's last known work is the fresco with the "Procession of the Magi" in the church of Santa Maria di Podone of Milan and fragments in the Rocca Borromeo di Angera (1445–1446).

1971 Chatham Cup

The 1971 Chatham Cup was the 44th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Early stages of the competition were run on a regional basis, with the National League teams receiving a bye until the later stages of the competition. In all, 99 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.
The 1971 final.
Prior to the changes in the organisation of the competition in 1970, finals were always between North Island and South Island teams. With the reorganisation of the draw, this was no longer the case, and so the 1971 final became the first local derby ever to be played out in the final, with both teams coming from Wellington. 
In the final, Western Suburbs made up for their defeat the previous year by seeing of neighbours Wellington City, who had been formed as a national league side through a merger of Miramar Rangers and Hungaria. In a howling Wellington southerly wind, Dave Wallace and Allan Jeffrey scored for Suburbs while Paul Cameron and Julius Beck countered for City. With the scores tied, the teams went to extra time, where the game remained locked at 2-2 until the last moments. With the final kick of the game Barry Humphreys sent a long ball forward which caught the breeze and bounced over the City keeper into his net.
Results.
Third Round.
† Due to the regional nature of the early part of the competition, Caversham and Invercargill United both progressed to a regional play-off, despite their losses in this round of the competition

Matthew Polly

Matthew Polly is an American author who in 2007 published his memoir "American Shaolin". In 2011, he published the book "Tapped Out" about the two years he spent training to become a mixed martial artist.
Polly was born and grew up in Kansas and graduated from Topeka West High School. In 1992, at 21-years old, Polly took a leave of absence from Princeton University and traveled to China to train at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of Chan (Zen) Buddhism and kung fu. 
In exchange for $1,300 a month Polly was allowed to stay and train with the monks. He spent two years at the temple and became the first American accepted as a Shaolin disciple. His experiences included training seven hours a day six days a week, involving running, breathing exercises, calisthenics, kung fu and gymnastics. He became a formidable kickboxer, and won a challenge match against a kung fu master from another province. He also became an "iron forearm" expert, where his arm became impervious to pain by calluses formed by bashing his arm against a tree for 30 minutes per day.
In 2003, he wrote a series of travel articles about his experiences in China for the online magazine Slate.com, "Return to the Shaolin Temple", and again in 2004 with a series on Monroe Elementary School in Topeka, Kansas. 
April 13, 2005, he appeared as a guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.
Polly wrote about his experiences in China in "American Shaolin", published in 2007 by Gotham in the US (ISBN 1592402623) and by Abacus in the UK.
Throughout his book Matthew Polly uses several words in the Chinese language pidgin. During his time in China, Matthew Polly learns a lot about Chinese culture. One aspect of the Chinese culture that intrigues him is the language. Even though he spent quite a bit of time learning the language before he left, Matthew Polly realizes that his vocabulary is that of a 6th grader’s and he has much to learn.

Malachy Conlon

Malachy Conlon (died 27 March 1950) was a nationalist politician in Ireland.
Conlon strongly believed that there was a need for a membership organisation linking nationalists in Northern Ireland. He pursued this theme during his campaign for the Nationalist Party in South Armagh at the Northern Ireland general election, 1945. During the campaign, which he fought against a Northern Ireland Labour Party incumbent, he stressed the importance of Christianity to Irish identity and contrasted this with what he described as the "flag of the communist Jew.
Following his election, Conlon worked with Eddie McAteer to found the Irish Anti-Partition League in November 1945, and was appointed its full-time Secretary.

Dominican Air Force

The Air Force of the Dominican Republic or "Fuerza Aérea de Republica Dominicana", is one of the three branches of the Military of the Dominican Republic, together with the Army and the Navy.
History.
In 1932 the "El Arma de Aviación del Ejército Nacional" was formed as part of the Dominican Army. Until 1942 only about a dozen aircraft were purchased. The service was renamed "Compañia de Aviación del Ejército Nacional" on October 26, 1942. Whilst granting base facilities to the United States during World War II the Dominican Republic received limited quantities of Lend-Lease military equipment. In 1947 a group of Dominican Republic exiles from Cuba tried to invade the country. The government wanted to receive large quantities of bombers and fighters aircraft from the United States, but the government blocked these sales and prevented sales of the Canadian government to President Trujillo. But agents of the president managed to buy some Beaufighter and Mosquito aircraft from the United Kingdom. After signing the Rio Treaty 1947 the Dominican Republic received large quantities of aircraft, for example 25 P-47D fighter-bomber and 30 AT-6 trainers from the United States. With this influx of aircraft the Compañia de Aviación expanded and became an independent service on January 15, 1948, and was renamed "Cuerpo de Aviación Militar Dominicana". It moved its headquarters to Base Aérea Presidente Trujillo, in the capital's suburb of San Isidro.
The Air Force underwent several name changes during the 1950s, being known as the Dominican Military Aviation during 1952-55 and 1957–62 and as the Dominican Air Force during 1955-57. In 1962 it again became known as the Dominican Air Force, the name is still in use today.
In 1952, 25 Vampires and 32 North American P-51D were bought from Sweden but similar purchases from Canada and Japan were again blocked by the United States. By 1956 the Fuerza Aérea Dominicana had about 240 aircraft. During the next years most of the post-war equipment was at the end of its useful life. After the assassination of President Trujillo in 1961 funds for the Air Force decreased and in 1963 the Air Force had only 110 aircraft.
During the next 15 years the number of aircraft in the Air Force declined again and only second-line material, such as training aircraft or helicopters, were acquired. In the early 1980s the Fuerza Aérea Dominicana had about 80 aircraft in five operational squadrons with most of the aircraft and helicopters operating out of San Isidro Air Base in Santo Domingo.
On the 22nd of September 1998 Hurricane George struck San Isidro the main FAD base and destroyed one hangar and severely damaged another, destroying the aircraft in both hangars. The natural disaster saw the FAD new aircraft enter service such as eight ENAER T-35 Pilláns that were delivered in two batches, the first in November 1999 and the second in January 2000. During the same period three CASA 212-400 transport planes were ordered.
Aircraft inventory.
The Air Force operates 44 aircraft, including 27 helicopters.
The Dominican Air Force was offered 3 Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopters by its U.S allies, but turned the offer down due to that it could not afford the maintenance. In 2007 the Dominican Air Force announced that it will purchase 8 Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano aircraft from Brazil. By the end of 2008 the purchase was approved and the first two aircraft were delivered in 2009. The Dominican Air force recently acquired an EL/M-2106NG - Air Defense Search Radar - ADSR.

Ivan Petrella

Ivan Petrella (born November 8th 1969) is an Argentine social theorist and liberation theologian. He is an associate professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida and co-executive editor of the “Reclaiming Liberation Theology” book series with SCM Press. 
Theological views.
As an Argentine liberation theologian that is also agnostic, Petrella’s scholarship cuts across religious studies departments and divinity schools, the United States and Latin America, and theology and the social sciences. He is difficult to categorize. Historian Mario Aguilar notes that “for an Argentinean newspaper, he is a theologian, while for others in the United States he is a scholar of religion, two hats in one.” His work “marks the appearance of something new and something different within the discourse of liberation theology as a world phenomenon.” Petrella is particularly interested in bridging the divide between different liberation theologies including black theology, Latin American liberation theology, Womanist theology and Hispanic/Latino(a) theology. He also argues that disciplines like economics, political science, and law need to be transformed in light of liberation theology’s preferential option for the poor and envisions undercover liberation theologians posing as social scientists to engage that task: “Here the liberation theologian need not carry the label ‘theologian’ and works best under a different disciplinary guise. Could the future of liberation call for the dissolution of liberation theology as an identifiable field of production?”
Education.
Ivan Petrella holds a Bachelor’s degree from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, a Masters of Theological Studies from Harvard Divinity School and a Ph.D. in Religion and Law from Harvard University’s Committee on the Study of Religion in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The Gathering (Testament album)

__NOTOC__
The Gathering is the eighth studio album by American thrash metal band Testament, released on June 8, 1999. It was the first release the band had done with Spitfire Records. 
Co-produced by the last original remaining band members at that time, Chuck Billy and Eric Peterson, this was the first album featuring new musicians Steve DiGiorgio on bass guitar and Dave Lombardo on drums. Billy, Peterson and Lombardo, along with long time Testament collaborator Del James, are also given composer credits on the album.
Release.
"The Gathering" featured eleven tracks when it was released, drawing critic and fan acclaim for such songs as "D.N.R. (Do Not Resuscitate)", "Riding the Snake", and "Legions of the Dead".
After release Testament embarked on the Riding the Snake World Tour to promote the album with "touring" lead guitarist Steve Smyth (ex-Vicious Rumors) and ex-Sadus drummer Jon Allen. The tour ended in 2001 shortly before frontman Chuck Billy was diagnosed with cancer.
"The Gathering" is the first of five albums to date featuring engineering and mixing work done with artist Andy Sneap. It is also the first of five reissues that Testament has done with Prosthetic Records. 
The album was reissued January 8, 2008, with an instrumental bonus track, "Hammer of the Gods," increasing the new track total to twelve. While "Hammer of the Gods" is listed on the track listing of the original American release, it does not actually appear on the CD. However, it does appear on the worldwide Prosthetic Records 2008 reissue.
As of 2002, The Gathering had sold over 50,000 copies in the U.S. alone. 
Album cover artwork for "The Gathering" was done by Dave McKean who also did the cover art for the two prior Testament studio albums "Demonic" and "Low".
Critical reaction.
In a 2010 Interview, Chuck Billy describes how the free flow of ideas between Dave Lombardo and Eric Peterson was the "key and secret" to the album's overall heavier sound in comparison to previous albums. 
Eric Peterson was also working on a black metal side project, Dragonlord, at this time, possibly also influencing the upbeat tempo and darker sound. In fact, Steve DiGiorgio, Steve Smyth, and Jon Allen would later go on to perform and release material with Dragonlord.
Chuck Billy's aggressive vocal approaches and darker death metal sound were apparent earlier on the last album, "Demonic", and continued to be on "The Gathering", but it was the range and diversity that the singer achieved on this album that drew the highest acclaim.
While the album's songs range from heavier death metal to a more melodic thrash metal, it was the singer's ability to go from his distinct sound to a death metal growl while blending the two that has been truly noted as trademark Testament.
At the time of release Testament had not done a music video since 1994's "Low" and was looking at possibly using live footage as a music video to promote "The Gathering". "Demonic", the band's previous 1997 release, had been handled by a distribution company that went bankrupt to the tune of $44 million which had stranded most retail supply in locked warehouses and off the shelves, seriously hurting the album release.
"The Gathering" reached #48 on the German album charts, its only chart showing, possibly reflecting problems from the prior albums and a lack of coverage rather than weaknesses with the album.
Track listing.
"Hammer of the Gods" did not appear on the domestic American re-release, though the song title was listed on the album cover. It is an instrumental bonus track originally only available on the Japan reissue; however, it was eventually added to the Prosthetic Records worldwide 2008 re-release.

<doc id="19181123" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19181123" title="808s &amp; Heartbreak">
808s &amp; Heartbreak

808s & Heartbreak is the fourth studio album by American recording artist and producer Kanye West, released on November 24, 2008, by Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii during September to October 2008. It was produced primarily by West, No I.D., and Jeff Bhasker. Conceived in the wake of multiple events that distressed him in the previous year, the album marked a major musical departure for West from his previous work lyrically, vocally, and production-wise.
An electropop album, "808s & Heartbreak" was primarily sung rather than rapped by West and has themes of love, loneliness, and heartache. The album also contains extensive use of the Auto-Tune voice processor and the Roland TR-808 drum machine, which was utilized and manipulated by West to produce a distorted, electronic sound. Approaching the album's production in a minimalist fashion, West intended to contravene the typical sound of hip hop beat and instead evoke a presence of tribal drums.
The album debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, selling 450,145 copies in its first week. It produced four singles, including the hit singles "Love Lockdown" and "Heartless". Despite varying responses from music audiences towards West's stylistic change, "808s & Heartbreak" received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. It was named one of the best albums of 2008 in several critics' polls and year-end lists. It also impacted hip hop music stylistically, as a new wave of rappers adopted the album's aesthetic. "808s & Heartbreak" has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold 1,700,000 copies in the United States.
Background.
Following the release of his third studio album "Graduation", the remainder of 2007 and the following year featured events that profoundly affected Kanye West. On November 10, 2007, West's mother Donda West died due to complications arising from cosmetic surgery involving a tummy tuck and breast reduction procedure. Months later, West and fiancée Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. At the same time, West struggled to adapt to his newfound pop star status he had once striven to achieve, often becoming the subject of media scrutiny. The loss, loneliness and longing for companionship and a sense of normality served to inspire "808s & Heartbreak". West stated that "This album was therapeutic — it's lonely at the top." A photograph taken by Danny Clinch of West kissing his mother on the cheek was included in the album's booklet liner notes.
West felt that his emotions could not be fully expressed simply through rapping, saying that aside from the fact that rapping had limitations, there were "melodies that were in me — what was in me I couldn't stop." West went to classify "808s & Heartbreak" as a pop album, asserting his disdain towards the contemporary backlash to the concept of pop music and expressed admiration for what some pop stars have accomplished in their careers. He later stated that he wishes to present the music as a new genre called "pop art," clarifying that he was well aware of the visual art movement of the same name and wished to present a musical equivalent. "Either call it 'pop' or 'pop art,' either one I'm good with," he later stated.
Recording.
The album was recorded over a span of approximately three weeks from September to October 2008. Recording sessions took place at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California and at Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. As implied by its title, "808s & Heartbreak" prominently features the Roland TR-808 drum machine. Drawing inspiration from 1980s synthpop and electropop performers such as Phil Collins, Gary Numan, TJ Swan and Boy George, West felt that the 808 is a resourceful instrument that can be used to evoke emotion; the concept was introduced to him by Jon Brion. West utilized the sounds created by the 808 and manipulated its pitch to produce a distorted, electronic sound, an effect he referred to as "heartbreak". He felt the characteristic of the sound was representative of his state of mind. According to West, the fact that Hawaii's area code was "808" was coincidental, as he had already developed the album's title before being informed. The realization inspired him to pursue his direction with the album, however. In terms of musical direction, West's intentions, according to Mike Dean, were to go against the typical sound of hip hop beat, instead evoking the presence of tribal drums. Overall, West maintained a "minimal but functional" approach towards the album's studio production.
The album makes prominent use of the voice audio processor technology of Auto-Tune. West had previously experimented with the technology on "The College Dropout" for the background vocals of "Jesus Walks" and "Never Let Me Down", but he had not used it for lead vocals until 2008. "We were working on the remixes for Lil Wayne's 'Lollipop' and Young Jeezy's 'Put On' and he fell in love with the Auto-Tune", producer Mike Dean explained. Towards the end, West enlisted T-Pain for coaching on how to utilize the technology. West himself openly stated that he loved using Auto-Tune and was dismayed that the term has been commonly associated with being "wack". He considers the technology "the funnest thing to use" and compared the situation to when he was a child and thought the color pink was cool until someone told him "it was gay", producing an analogy of how the views of society can rob people of their confidence and self-esteem. He later went on to state that he enjoyed the electronic feel produced by Auto-Tune and sought out to juxtapose the mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks. 
Rapper Kid Cudi, who had signed onto West's G.O.O.D. Music label, contributed to two of the album's songs. Young Jeezy contributed a rap verse on the track "Amazing" while "See You in My Nightmares" is a duet with Lil Wayne. Singer-songwriter Esthero provided the few female vocals found on the album; credited under birth name Jenny-Bea Englishman, she co-wrote three tracks. When "RoboCop" appeared on the Internet, West refuted responsibility and was upset that the leak had occurred as the track was an unfinished version. Mike Dean had previously stated that the track was expected to receive additional treatment by Herbie Hancock before the album's release.
Music and lyrics.
"808s & Heartbreak" is a radical departure from West's previous hip hop albums. "808s & Heartbreak" is primarily made up of virtual synthesis, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks. Tracks on the album utilize step input drum machine and synth-bass parts. Step input sequencing, a product of vintage analogue devices limited to recording only 16 individual notes, was popular in music production during the 1980s, but also became available in digital workstations. 
The album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synths, and somber piano. Andy Kellman of Allmusic writes of the music, "Several tracks have almost as much in common with irrefutably bleak post-punk albums, such as New Order's "Movement" and The Cure's "Pornography", as contemporary rap and R&B." These musical elements help convey moods of despair and dejection that reflect the album's subject matter. Most of the lyrics are directed at an ex-lover; West refers to her treatment of him as "the coldest story ever told" on "Heartless", and on "RoboCop", she is called a "spoiled little L.A. girl" and is compared to the antagonist in the 1990 film "Misery". On "Welcome to Heartbreak", West's character faces an existential crisis as he dispassionately recounts sitting alone on a flight, with a laughing family seated ahead of him. He longs for his late mother on the album's penultimate track "Coldest Winter", which samples the desolate 1983 song "Memories Fade" by Tears for Fears.
Pitchfork Media's Scott Plagenhoef categorizes the album as "an introspective, minimal electro-pop record steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album". Music writer Robert Christgau calls it a "slow, sad-ass and self-involved ... breakup album" and analyzes that West's choice to "robotize as well as pitch-correct his voice both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties". Christgau asserts that its final track "Pinocchio Story" is "the only track here about what's really bringing down: not the loss of his girlfriend but the death of his mother, during cosmetic surgery that somewhere not too deep down he's sure traces all too directly to his alienated fame." West's singing has been characterized as "flat" and "nearly unmelodic" which "underscores his own cyborgish detachment." Canadian writer Stephen Marche views that West used "the shallow musical gimmickry of Auto-Tune, a program designed to eliminate individuality, and produced a hauntingly personal album."
Release and promotion.
On September 24, West announced that he had finished the album and would be releasing it sometime in November. In his blog post, he wrote "I changed my album to November something cause I finished the album and I felt like it..I want y'all to hear it as soon as possible". West later stated that the album would be released on November 25, 2008. However, Island Def Jam, the distributing label, brought the date forward by one day to capitalize on Thanksgiving weekend. "808s & Heartbreak" was also released on November 24, 2008 in the United Kingdom and the Philippines. A limited edition in a digipak case was first released in Germany on November 21, 2008. A special edition of the album was released on December 16 that contains the album in CD and dual LP format, and also features album artwork redone by the artist of the original cover, KAWS.
On October 16, West released an excerpt of "Coldest Winter" on the radio station Power 106 in Los Angeles. The track recreates elements of the song "Memories Fade" by the band Tears for Fears. The song "Paranoid" later leaked onto the Internet and features Mr. Hudson in the chorus. A remixed version of "Paranoid" was reported to feature pop singer Rihanna, but did not materialize. Also appearing prior to the release date were "Amazing" featuring Young Jeezy, "See You in My Nightmares" featuring Lil Wayne, "Street Lights", "Say You Will", "Welcome to Heartbreak" and "Bad News". An additional track, "Pinocchio Story" is a freestyle recorded at a live concert in Singapore. It was included in the album at the request of Beyoncé Knowles.
On October 14, West, in collaboration with Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft, hosted a promotional album listening event at Ace Gallery. Over 700 guests were invited to preview the entirety of "808s & Heartbreak". Under Beecroft's guidance, the event featured approximately forty nude women wearing nothing besides wool masks who silently stood in the center of the room. The women were illuminated by multicolored lights that would change as the music progressed. When it came time for him to speak, West stated that he'd been a fan of Beecroft's work and strong imagery, saying that he liked the idea of nudity because "society told us to wear clothes at a certain point". Beecroft had been contacted a month prior and conceptualized and generated the installation in a week. Beecroft admitted that while he had caught her offguard, she had the opportunity to hear the album for herself and heard things that touched her own life. Five days later, promotional photos for the album by photographer Willy Vanderperre were released. The images portrayed West wearing a grey glen plaid suit, large browline glasses, and a heart-shaped pin.
In October 2009, West was scheduled to embark on a tour, tour, in promotion of Gaga's "The Fame", and West's "808s & Heartbreak". It was canceled on October 1, 2009, without reason. Several songs from the album were performed by West during his live VH1 Storytellers performance, such as "Heartless", "Amazing" and "Say You Will."
Public reaction.
Before its release, reaction to "808s & Heartbreak" was mixed, ranging from anticipation to bewilderment and indifference to the album's concept. Upon the unveiling of the lead single "Love Lockdown" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune. The negative feedback intensified when West revealed that the entire album would be primarily sung with Auto-Tune rather than rapped and would focus on themes of love and heartache. 
Numerous hip hop fans and certain rappers mocked West for becoming "sappy" while others deemed the upcoming LP as a throwaway experimental album. Comparisons were drawn to "Electric Circus", an album recorded by West's labelmate and close friend Common. MTV eventually interviewed Common to share his thoughts and views on the artistic direction of the album. Common expressed both his understanding and his support for West's intentions, stating "I love it. I'mma tell you, as an artist, you wanna be free. I'mma do what I feel. You can't just cater to the audience. You gotta say, 'Hey, y'all, this is where I'm at.' For him to do an album called "808s and Heartbreak", you know that's where he is at this moment. I heard some songs, and I think it's fresh. I think the people are ready for it."
West received similar approval from Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, both of whom contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody is doing the same thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because "808s & Heartbreak" isn't out yet." Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in.
Commercial performance.
In its first week of sales, "808s & Heartbreak" reached the number one spot on "Billboard" 200, selling 450,145 units in its first week. In the last week of the year, "808s & Heartbreak" sold 165,100 copies, jumping from the eleventh spot back up to the number five on the "Billboard" 200. The album moved up again the following week, selling 70,900 units and landing at number three. On January 27, 2009, "808s & Heartbreak" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, serving as West's fourth album to ship one million copies in the United States. As of June 14, 2013, it has sold 1.7 million copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.
Despite the debate and uncertainty surrounding the album's conception, its preceding singles demonstrated outstanding chart performances. Upon its release, the lead single "Love Lockdown" debuted at number three on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and became a "Hot Shot Debut". It is the highest debut of West's career, the second highest debut on the Hot 100 that year and the tenth song of the millennium to debut in the top three. Grossing over 1.3 million copies at the iTunes Store alone, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA by the end of the year. On August 18, 2010, it was certified triple platinum by the RIAA, for shipments of three million units in the US. The single was also met by positive reviews from music critics, eventually culminating with being crowned "Song of the Year" by "Time". The second single, "Heartless" performed similarly and became his second consecutive "Hot Shot Debut" by debuting at number four on the "Billboard" Hot 100. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA, having shipped two million units in the US. Due in part to the momentum produced by the album's release, certain tracks were met by chart success despite not actually being released as singles. The tenth track "See You in My Nightmares" became yet another "Hot Shot Debut," peaking at number twenty-one in the US and at number twenty-two in Canada while the fourth track "Amazing" charted at 81 on the Hot 100. Following suit, "Welcome to Heartbreak" peaked at number eighty-seven on the Pop 100.
Critical reception.
"808s & Heartbreak" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Alex Macpherson of "The Guardian" praised its "stylised, minimal music". "USA Today"s Steve Jones commented that "West deftly uses the 808 drum machine and Auto-Tune vocal effect to channel his feelings of hurt, anger and doubt through his well-crafted lyrics". Dan Cairns of "The Times" stated, "This so should not work...Yet "808s & Heartbreak" is a triumph, recklessly departing from the commercially copper-bottomed script and venturing far beyond West’s comfort zone." Tom Breihan of "The Village Voice" found it to be "a work borne of depression" and dubbed it as West's "superstar-freakout album: his "Low", his "Trans", his "Kid A". The one where he decides that frozen remoteness is the only thing that makes sense". "Rolling Stone"s Jody Rosen commended West's incorporation of the Roland TR-808 drum machine and described the album as "Kanye's would-be "Here, My Dear" or "Blood on the Tracks", a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing". Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that its "frosty, minimal sound backs lyrics of surprisingly raw emotion". 
However, "The Independent" found its "immersion in personal misery" uncomfortable and commented that the "stylistic tropes quickly become irritating". Allmusic editor Andy Kellman stated "no matter its commendable fearlessness, the album is a listless, bleary trudge along West's permafrost". Charles Aaron of "Spin" criticized the songs' musical structures, calling the album "a long processional that starts and restarts and never reaches the ceremony". Slant Magazine's Wilson McBee panned West's singing, and Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" singled it out as the "weakness for which this album will ultimately be remembered, some solid songs notwithstanding." Caramanica wrote that, "at best, it is a rough sketch for a great album, with ideas he would have typically rendered with complexity, here distilled to a few words, a few synthesizer notes, a lean drumbeat. At worst, it’s clumsy and underfed, a reminder that all of that ornamentation served a purpose". "Chicago Sun-Times" writer Jim DeRogatis stated, "If West had interspersed the more mechanical tracks with some that were the exact opposite—say, simple piano interludes provided by his old collaborators John Legend or Jon Brion—he might have made a masterpiece. Instead, he's merely given us an extremely intriguing, sporadically gripping, undeniably fearless and altogether unexpected piece of his troubled soul." 
Greg Kot of the "Chicago Tribune" dubbed it West's "most radical yet" and stated, "This is not the album Kanye West fans likely expected, nor is it one they likely will embrace as eagerly as his previous multimillion-sellers ... This one is for him. It remains to be seen if he goes back to making records for everybody else. For now, this is one fascinatingly perverse detour." Jaimie Hodgson of "NME" called the album "a surprising, but bold and brave progression from last year’s confused "Graduation"". Dave Heaton of PopMatters complimented West's "winning ways with both song and album construction, and with the way he captures a particular feeling through unusual, evocative, carefully crafted music that’s both simple and complex, cold and warm, mechanical and human, melodic and harsh". Chris Richards of "The Washington Post" called it "an information-age masterpiece". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found the album to have "its own dark sound and its own engaging tunes", and gave it an A– rating, indicating "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction".
Accolades.
The album was named one of the ten best albums of 2008 by a number of publications, including "The Hartford Courant" (number seven), "NOW" (number four), "The Observer" (number eight), "Vibe" (no order) and "Time" (number six). Pitchfork Media named "808s & Heartbreak" the twenty-first best album of 2008. Dan Leroy of "LA Weekly" cited it as one of the top ten hip hop albums of the year. "Jam!" named it the top album of 2008. "Chicago Sun-Times" writer Jim DeRogatis included the album on his list of the year's ten best albums and wrote, "With every listen, the poignancy of these personal tales of loss grows deeper, perfectly matched by the cold, lonely, robotic but nevertheless winning grooves that accompany them. Upon further reflection, it is a brave and daring 4-star effort that deserves to be heard by any fan of adventurous pop music." "Time Out New York" featured the album on its list of the Best and Worst Albums of 2008. The magazine's writer Colin St. John cited "808s & Heartbreak" as one of the worst of 2008, and editor Steve Smith named it third on his best-of list, while calling the album "the year's most misunderstood triumph." "808s & Heartbreak" received a nomination for Outstanding Album at 40th annual NAACP Image Awards. The album also received a nomination for Best Album at the 2009 MOBO Awards. In 2009, "Rolling Stone" ranked it number 63 on its list of the 100 Best Album of the Decade.
Despite its accolades, "808s & Heartbreak" was largely overlooked as a contender for the 52nd Grammy Awards. According to "Vibe" magazine editor-in-chief Jermaine Hall, West's controversial incident at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the ensuing backlash against West "probably hurt him", but perceived West's stylistic change on the album as the primary reason for it not being nominated. West received one solo nomination, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for "Amazing", and five other nominations for his guest appearances and collaborational work.
Legacy and influence.
Although West designed it as a melancholic pop album, "808s & Heartbreak" had a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music. During the release of "The Blueprint 3", New York rap mogul Jay-Z revealed that his next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, "... it's not gonna be a #1 album. That's where I'm at right now. I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made." Jay-Z elaborated that like West, he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop, was being inspired by indie-rockers like Grizzly Bear and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip hop. 
The album impacted hip hop stylistically and laid the groundwork for a new wave of hip hop artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including B.o.B, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, and Drake. Jake Paine of HipHopDX dubbed the album as "our "Chronic"", noting West's effect on hip hop with "808s & Heartbreak" as "a sound, no different than the way Dr. Dre's synthesizer challenged the boom-bap of the early '90s." "Rolling Stone" journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article, "Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, "808s & Heartbreak" has revealed itself to be Kanye’s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant."
Music writer Greg Kot views that the album "set off" the "wave of inward-looking sensitivity" and "emo"-inspired rappers during the late 2000s, writing that it "presaged everything from the introspective hip-hop of Kid Cudi's "" (2009) to the wispy crooning, plush keyboards and light mechanical beats of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and British dub-step balladeer James Blake." Craig D. Linsey of "The Village Voice" writes that the album's "naked humanity ... practically set off the emo-rap/r&b boom that everyone from Drake to Frank Ocean to The Weeknd now traffic in." Marcus Scott of "GIANT" writes that rappers such as B.o.B, Drake, and Kid Cudi followed West's album with similarly-minded works, with Scott noting West's introspective, emotional themes and his synthpop and "Vangelis-inspired" music as influences. Drake's 2009 mixtape "So Far Gone" received comparisons from music critics to "808s & Heartbreak". Todd Martens of the "Los Angeles Times" cited "808s & Heartbreak" as "the template [...] for essentially the entirety of Drake's young career", and that wrote that he "shares West's love for mood and never-ending existential analysis". In a 2009 interview, Drake cited West as "the most influential person" in shaping his own sound.

Gerber method

The Gerber Method is a primary and historic chemical test to determine the fat content of milk and other substances. The Gerber Method is the primary testing method in Europe and much of the world. The fairly similar Babcock test is used primarily in the United States, although the Gerber Method also enjoys significant use in the U.S. as well.
The Gerber Method was developed and patented by Dr. Niklaus Gerber of Switzerland in 1891.
Milk fat is separated from proteins by adding sulfuric acid. The separation is facilitated by using amyl alcohol and centrifugation. The fat content is read directly via a special calibrated butyrometer. Gerber developed specialized butyrometers (tubes), pipettes, and centrifuges. Water baths built specifically for the Gerber tubes are often used.
The test is still in widespread use today and is the basis for numerous national and international standards. The test continues to be improved and standardized.

Paddy Maxwell

Paddy Maxwell (12 March 1909–15 December 1991) was a solicitor and a nationalist politician in Ireland.
Maxwell studied at the Convent of Mercy School, the Christian Brothers' School and St Columb's College in Derry. In 1934, he was elected to the City Council for the Nationalist Party, holding his seat until 1946, and also became Chairman of the Derry Catholic Registration Association. He entered employment with the Council, but resigned in 1937 in protest at a proposal to gerrymander the wards.
Maxwell founded the Irish Union Association in 1936. In 1937, he was elected to the Northern Ireland House of Commons representing Foyle, but pledged not to take his seat. This enabled him to become the leader of the Nationalist group on the council in 1938.
A nationalist convention before the Northern Ireland general election, 1945, reselected Maxwell but mandated him to take his seat in Parliament. He did so for a few months, then attended only occasionally for the next few years. Eddie McAteer objected to Maxwell's abstentionism and challenged him at the nationalist convention held before the 1953 general election. McAteer was selected, and Maxwell stood instead as an independent. He was defeated and left politics.
Maxwell was President of the Londonderry Rotary Club in 1958/9, and Chairman of the movement in Ireland in 1963/4. He served as Vice President, then President, of the Law Society of Northern Ireland from 1966 to 1968. He was also a member of the Council of the International Bar Association in 1968, then served as a Resident Magistrate until 1980.

Early Beginnings.
The company was founded in 1997 by David "Beno" Benveniste, expanding out of Benveniste's independent music management practice. Beno was born and raised in Beverly Hills, California, and graduated from the University of Southern California. He began a career in the music industry after developing the band System of a Down. Through his creation of the marketing company Streetwise Concepts and Culture, a fan volunteer network that assembled over the Internet for grassroots promotion, Beno tapped into the power of youth marketing to promote the group. Within three years, he was able to build an army of over 30,000 kids through the platform to distribute promotional items to their friends on behalf of bands he managed through “hand-to-hand” promotion.
Moving the Business Forward.
In 2004, Benveniste signed a joint venture deal to move the Velvet Hammer music label from Atlantic Records to Columbia Records over a several year period. Under the terms of the deal, Velvet Hammer clients Taproot, Poison the Well and Gratitude would continue to record with Atlantic, while Benveniste signed OneRepublic to Columbia. Afterwards, Sony/ATV and Velvet Hammer Music collaborated to publish the ASCAP award winning song "Apologize" by OneRepublic. Benveniste already had a long established relationship with Columbia and its parent, Sony, having first brought System of a Down to Columbia in 1996 and at one time managing Mudvayne, signed to Sony's Epic Records. In 2008, Velvet Hammer signed a three-year deal with Sony subsidiary RED Distribution, which handled the marketing and publicity for Taproot's album "Our Long Road Home".
In 1999, Velvet Hammer was drawn into a feud with Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit when Taproot chose to sign with Velvet Hammer Management rather than Interscope.

The 18th Brigade was formed on 13 October 1939 as part of the 6th Division. Upon formation the brigade consisted of the following battalions: the 2/9th, the 2/10th, the 2/11th and the 2/12th Battalions, which were raised from Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia.
Following training, the brigade was dispatched to the Middle East, departing from Melbourne in May 1940. However, while they were at sea they were diverted to the United Kingdom in order to help defend the island against a possible invasion by German forces following the Fall of France. After landing at Gourock, Scotland, the brigade moved south to Salisbury Plain where they undertook training and defensive duties. In the United Kingdom, the 18th Brigade provided a cadre to the newly formed 25th Brigade and became part of the 9th Division when it was raised in October 1940.
Middle East.
Later, when the threat of invasion of the United Kingdom decreased, the decision was made to transfer the Australian forces there to the Middle East. The 18th Brigade arrived there in early January 1941. Around this time, the 2nd AIF was reorganised and each brigade was reduced from four battalions to three. As a result, the 2/11th Battalion was transferred to the 19th Brigade. At the same time also, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 7th Division. Following this, on 21 March 1941, the brigade took part in an attack on an Italian stronghold at Giarabub, south of Bardia. Although the fortress was held by about 1,500 Italians supported by artillery, the Australian force dispatched only consisted of a reinforced battalion due to supply difficulties. Setting out on 10 March from Siwa, the assault began early on the morning of 21 March from the south over marshy ground. Led by the 2/9th Battalion with machine-gun and mortar support from the 2/12th and 2/10th Battalions, the attack was put in from the south while the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment feigned an attack from the north at the strongest point of the fortress. A heavy sandstorm obscured visibility, which hindered the supporting artillery and resulted in a number of casualties when one company moved beyond the barrage. Nevertheless, heavy fighting followed and resistance continued until 2:00 pm in the afternoon when the Italians surrendered. About 250 Italians were killed and 1,300 captured for the loss of 17 Australians killed and 77 wounded. Following the attack, the 18th Brigade returned to Ikingi Maryut.
In April the brigade was sent to Tobruk where they took part in the defence of the port between May and August 1941. In September 1941, the brigade rejoined the rest of the 7th Division, which had been taking part in the fighting against Vichy French forces in the Syria-Lebanon campaign. Following the armistice the division was allocated the task of undertaking garrison duties and the 18th Brigade was subsequently stationed at Aleppo, near the Turkish border.
New Guinea.
The 18th Brigade returned to Australia in early 1942 following the outbreak of the Pacific War. Following defensive duties and training in Queensland, the 18th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier George Wootten, took part in the Battle of Milne Bay. Deployed with a battery from the 2/5th Field Regiment attached at brigade level, the 18th Brigade arrived at Milne Bay between 12 and 21 August. Between 27 August and 7 September the brigade played an important role in the fighting which resulted in the first major defeat of the Japanese during the war. One of the brigade's soldiers, Corporal John French, of the 2/9th Battalion, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions during the fighting on 4 September 1942.
Later, as the 7th Division was assigned to the advance on the Japanese bases on the Papuan coast around Buna and Gona, the brigade, although understrength, was transferred to Buna in mid-December 1942 with the 2/9th Battalion landing at Oro Bay on 15 December. On 21 January the brigade captured Sanananda alongside the US 163rd Infantry Regiment. They were finally withdrawn back to Australia on 10 March 1943. During the fighting around Buna, the 18th Brigade suffered 425 men killed and more than 800 wounded. This represented 96 per cent of the brigade's strength at the start of the campaign.
By the time that the brigade returned to Australia, it was down to only 44 per cent of its authorised strength. In early July, the brigade was brought back up to strength with an intake of 1,300 men from the 1st Motor Brigade, which was subsequently disbanded. In August 1943, after training and re-organisation around Ravenshoe, Queensland, the 18th Brigade was deployed to Port Moresby in preparation for further operations, arriving there on 12 August. During the early phases of the Finisterre Range campaign the brigade remained in reserve around Port Moresby, while the other two brigades of the 7th Division, the 21st and 25th Brigades, were deployed to defend the approaches to Lae. They remained there until 4 January 1944 when the brigade was transported by air to Dumpu to relieve the 21st Brigade around Shaggy Ridge, subsequently taking part in the fighting around the Kankiryo Saddle, Prothero I and II and Crater Hill. Following the conclusion of the fighting around Shaggy Ridge in February, the brigade remained in New Guinea until May 1944 when they were withdrawn back to Australia for re-organisation.
Borneo.
The brigade's final involvement in the war came when they landed at Balikpapan in Borneo on 1 July 1945. Following the initial landing, the 18th Brigade, supported by 'D' Company, 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion, secured the high ground around Klandasan. On 3 July they captured the town of Balikpapan before being relieved by the 25th Brigade. Following the completion of hostilities in August, the brigade remained on Borneo as the demobilisation process began. The 18th Brigade was disbanded on 3 January 1946 at Balikpapan after its component battalions were disbanded throughout December 1945 and January 1946.
Commanders.
The following officers served as commanding officer of the 18th Brigade:

Texas Medal of Honor Memorial

The Texas Medal of Honor Memorial is a statue commemorating recipients of the Medal of Honor from the state of Texas. Sculpted by Doyle Glass and Scott Boyer, it was dedicated on Memorial Day of 2008 and is located in Midland, Texas, at the Commemorative Air Force International Headquarters. The Memorial depicts Medal of Honor recipient George H. O'Brien, Jr. as he would appear on the day he earned the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. Perched on a rock, the heroic-sized bronze figure rises above a granite base, which displays the names of most recipients of the medal from Texas.
One notable exception may be the earliest Texan recipient, Milton M. Holland. He was born a Texas slave in 1844 and served with the Fifth U.S. Colored Troops during the Civil War. On September 29, 1864, during an attack in which all his unit's officers were killed or disabled, Sergeant Major Holland took over despite his own wounds, and led his comrades to take the Confederate position near Richmond, Virginia. He was awarded the Medal of Honor on April 6, 1865, and at his death in 1910 was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.
The Model for this statue was Buck Hartlage a Louisville Kentucky native.

Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 3½ stars stating "Bill Frisell has been one of the most unique jazz-based guitarists of the 1980s and '90s, a very eclectic player who can switch styles and sounds on a moment's notice, yet is always quite distinctive. On this atmospheric and picturesque set, Frisell uses his regular quartet of the time (cellist Hank Roberts, bassist Kermit Driscoll and drummer Joey Baron) on some selections, but also interacts with fellow guitarist Arto Lindsay, keyboardist Peter Scherer and, on "Some Song and Dance," baritonist Doug Wieselman and both Julius Hemphill and Billy Drewes on altos... A very intriguing and colorful set of eccentric music. ".

Guayrá

Guayrá was a former region of the Spanish Empire in what is now modern Paraguay and Brazil (Federal State of Paraná). It was named after a cacique of the region whose name was Guayrá or Guayracá.
The limits of Guayrá were the Iguazu River on the south, the Paraná River on the west, the Tiete (or Añemby) River to the north, and the line of the Treaty of Tordesillas to the east. The Tiete also marked the boundary between the Tupi and Guarani Indians. 
Aleixo Garcia crossed the region in 1522. In 1542, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca travelled through its southern reaches on his way to Asunción from Santa Catarina Island. 
The town of Ontiveros was founded by Captain Garcia Rodriguez de Vergara on orders from Domingo Martínez de Irala in 1554. It was located on the left bank of the Paraná, between the Iguazu and Pipiri-Guazu, about 50 kilometers north of Salto del Guairá, in the territory of the cacique Canendiyu, and was intended to serve as a connection to Portuguese Brazil. 
Ciudad Real del Guayrá (also referred to simply as Guayrá) was founded by Captain Ruy Diaz Melgarejo, on the left bank of the Parana at the confluence of the Pipiry-Guazu, in 1556. 
Guayrá was covered with dense forest and many rivers, and by 1600, it had become a place of refuge for the Guarani from the "encomenderos" of Paraguay and the "esclavistas" of Brazil. It was the main region occupied by the Jesuit reductions. However, it was destroyed by the bandeirantes from São Paulo in 1631.

Interphase (video game)

Interphase is a 1989 3D first-person and puzzle video game developed by The Assembly Line and published by Image Works for multiple platforms.
The developers were licensed to use concepts from "Neuromancer", reflected in the virtual-reality cyberspace concept and theme of a powerful corporation.
The game is considered an early first-person shooter, pre-dating "Catacomb 3-D" and "Wolfenstein 3D". However, the game primarily focuses on puzzle-solving using the interaction between a 3D cyberpunk environment and its conceptual relationship with a 2D zoomable blueprint in which a non-player character is indirectly guided through the floors of a high-security building.
Later games that have a similar style to the 3D elements in "Interphase" include "Pyrotechnica" and "Rez".
Storyline.
In a dystopian cyberpunk future, "The Dreamtrack Corporation" has cornered the entertainment market, selling "DreamTracks", dreamed or imagined adventures and experiences which can be enjoyed by consumers. The player is "Chad", a DreamTrack "Dreamer" who has discovered that Dreamtrack Corporation is using the DreamTracks to destroy people's minds. He decides to break into Dreamtrack HQ. To overcome the high-tech security systems, his girlfriend, "Kaf-E", agrees to break into the building physically, while "Chad" enters a virtual reality world, inspired by "Neuromancer", in order to hack into and disable the computer-controlled defences.
Gameplay.
The action mostly takes place in two modes: a 3D cyberpunk environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which pose a threat to the player's ability to jack in to the system, and which must be defeated.
While viewing the 2D schematic, the action in the 3D world continues, so it's essential that enemy ships have been dispensed with before puzzle-solving can proceed. Otherwise, the player becomes a sitting duck.
The game was ranked the 38th best game of all time by "Amiga Power".
Graphical style.
The 2D environment is a polygon-based schematic closely resembling an animated blueprint. A very deep zoom-in is possible and necessary. The progress of "Kaf-E" and the positions of moving objects (e.g., security guards) and fixed objects such as cameras can all be monitored in this view.
The 3D environment is a first-person view from the front of a virtual ship navigating a multiple-level environment. The virtual levels do not represent the floors of the building, they simply represent parts of the computer system. Navigation between levels is accomplished by flying through square panels.
Platforms supported.
The game runs on DOS, Atari ST and Amiga. On the PC platform it requires a 286 processor and VGA graphics.

Lord Byron of Broadway

Lord Byron of Broadway (1930), also known as What Price Melody?, is an American musical drama film, directed by Harry Beaumont and William Nigh. It was based on a best selling book by Nell Martin, which "was widely praised by critics as an extremely true and amusing romance of stage life." It was filmed in black and white with two-color Technicolor sequences.
Soundtrack.
Charles Kaley recorded two of the songs for Brunswick Records (Record Number 4718). These songs were "Should I" and "A Bundle of Love Letters". Both of these songs proved to be major song hits in late 1929 and early 1930 and were recorded by numerous artists. For example, James Melton and Lewis James recorded vocal versions of "A Bundle of Love Letters" while Frank Munn recorded "Should I". 
Production.
In 1928, MGM announced it was going to turn the novel "Lord Byron of Broadway" by Nell Martin into a musical starring stars William Haines and Bessie Love. However, as they both had mediocre singing voices, they were replaced by Charles Kaley, star of "Earl Carroll's Vanities" and Ethelind Terry, star of Florenz Ziegfeld's "Rio Rita". At that time, Kaley and Terry were well-known stage stars.
MGM used the "Woman in the Shoe" musical segment in two short films, "Nertsery Rhymes" (1933) and "Roast Beef and Movies" (1934).
Critical response.
The expensive film received mixed reviews, mainly due to the lackluster direction of William Nigh and Harry Beaumont. Its Technicolor sequences and musical score, however, were universally praised. The story's strong enough to be festooned with Technicolored girls, ballets, songs and effects without breaking down," said "Photoplay" "You'll like this."
Sheet music sales and sales of phonograph records with songs from the film were brisk. "Should I" and "A Bundle of Old Love Letters" proved to be among the most popular song hits of the year 1930.

Wentworth by the Sea

The Wentworth by the Sea (formerly The Hotel Wentworth) is a historic grand hotel in New Castle, New Hampshire, United States. It is now called The Wentworth by the Sea Hotel & Spa. It is one of a handful of the state's surviving Gilded Age grand hotels, and the last located on the seacoast. 
Wentworth by the Sea is a member of Historic Hotel of America the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
History.
The hotel was built in 1874 by Daniel Chase, a distiller from Somerville, Massachusetts, and for the first two years was named Wentworth Hall. It was bought by Frank Jones in 1879 and expanded in the Second Empire style. With Jones's death, the hotel was sold in 1902. 
In 1905, the hotel housed the Russian and Japanese delegations who concluded the Treaty of Portsmouth to end the Russo-Japanese War. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt suggested the peace talks, and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his actions. Both delegations were welcomed at no charge, with Frank Jones' executor Judge Calvin Page providing hospitality as Jones' will stipulated he should. The final document was signed at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard where formal negotiations took place, but the final language of the treaty was drafted, and the armistice ending the fighting, was signed at The Wentworth. In addition, the Japanese hosted an "International Love Fest" at the hotel on the signing. 
After a number of owners, Harry Beckwith bought the hotel in 1920 and ran it for 25 years. In 1946, it was acquired by Margaret and James Barker Smith for $200,000. On July 4, 1964, Emerson and Jane Reed became the first African-Americans to overcome the hotel's segregation policy, dining at its restaurant.
With declining fortunes and changing owners, the hotel closed in 1982. A local group, Friends of the Wentworth, formed and tried to preserve the hotel. When they were unable to locate sufficient support, Alan Green, president of the Green Corporation (which owned the hotel at that time), announced its planned demolition in 1995. Attention was drawn to the plight of the Victorian hotel when it appeared on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's (NTHP) list of America's Most Endangered Places, and the History Channel's "America's Most Endangered" the following year. This postponed the demolition sufficiently to identify a buyer, and Ocean Properties acquired the property in 1997. The hotel was subsequently renovated, reopened in 2003, and is operated by Ocean Properties as a Marriott resort. The Wentworth by the Sea is a member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation Historic Hotels of America.
The now-independent Wentworth by the Sea Country Club is home to the golf course that was initially designed by George Wright in 1897, enlarged by Donald Ross in 1921, and further expanded to 18 holes by Geoffrey Cornish in 1964. The Wentworth Marina is also independently operated and welcomes Wentworth hotel guests.

Aleixo Garcia

Aleixo Garcia, also known in Spanish as Alejo García (d. 1525 Paraguay) was a Portuguese explorer and conquistador who explored the Rio de la Plata in service to Spain, and later the Paraguay and Bolivia.
He was a member of the failed expedition of Juan Díaz de Solís, seeking to find a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. After reaching the mouths of the Uruguay and Paraná, it was apparent that the Rio de la Plata was not such a strait. At this point, de Solís was killed - on testimony of his crew - by cannibal Indians (variously identified as the Charrúa or Guaraní) and his lieutenants opted to return to Spain.
On their return, some of their boats were shipwrecked off Santa Catarina in present-day Brazil. Among the 11 or 18 Spanish and Portuguese survivors was Aleixo Garcia, a Portuguese adventurer who had previously made contact with the Guaraní. With them were also the Portuguese sailors Henrique Montes and Francisco Pacheco and the Spanish (or Portuguese by other sources) Mechior Ramires. Melchior Ramires would help and guide Cristóvão Jacques on his voyage of exploration to Río de la Plata in 1521, returning again to Santa Catarina.
Aleixo Garcia now traveled inland, living among the Guaranís who know of the network of trails called Peabiru that covered this part of South America. While there, he heard tales of a "White King" who lived to the west, ruling cities of incomparable riches and splendor.
After eight years, Garcia had gathered enough men and supplies to attempt a voyage to the land of the "White King." Marching towards the west, using the trail network Peabiru, his company discovered a great waterfall. Credit for the discovery of the Iguazu Falls is usually given to the governor Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, and historian Efraím Cardozo asserts Garcia crossed the Paraná at the smaller waterfall called Monday.
During 1524 and 1525, the small group recruited an army of about 2,000 local Guaraní soldiers from the vicinity of Asunción as reinforcement to invade the promising new land. They then entered the Chaco, a rough semi-desert region. Garcia was the first European to cross the Chaco and even managed to penetrate the outer defenses of the Inca Empire on the hills of the Andes, in present-day Bolivia. He was the first European to do so, accomplishing this eight years before Francisco Pizarro.
Garcia looted an impressive booty of silver. When the army of Huayna Cápac arrived to challenge him, Garcia then retreated with the spoils, only to be assassinated by his Indian allies near San Pedro on the Paraguay River.
The Indians, however, spared the life of his son, who was the first Paraguayan mestizo. News of this excursion into Incan territory later distracted Sebastian Cabot from his expedition to the East Indies (which could have resulted in the second circumnavigation of the globe after Ferdinand Magellan) causing him to imprison or maroon his lieutenants and remain in the Rio de la Plata region for several years.

Axiom of Equity

The Axiom of Equity was proposed by Samuel Clarke (1675 - 1729), an English philosopher, in the spirit of the ethic of reciprocity. In his book "A Discourse Concerning the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion, and the Truth and Certainty of the Christian Revelation", Clarke wrote: ""Whatever I judge reasonable or unreasonable for another to do to me; that, by the same judgment, I declare reasonable or unreasonable, that I in the like case should do for him.""
Dr. Hastings Rashdall, in his 1907 book ""the Theory of Good and Evil"", restated the axiom as: 
""One man's good is of as much intrinsic worth as the like good of another.""

Robert Lee Burns

Robert Lee Burns (born 1930 or 1931 - died 2002) was an American former bank robber who was the subject of an interstate battle over an issue of parole of convicted criminals.
In 1963, Burns drove the getaway car after a bank robbery in Sacramento, California. One of the robbers shot and killed a police officer, resulting in felony murder convictions for the three robbers. They were sentenced to life in prison.
At the time of the robbery, Burns was on parole for a crime in Oregon.
California transferred Burns to Oregon to serve out the remainder of his Oregon conviction. Oregon, however, inexplicably released Burns after he had served his time in that state, rather than returning him to California to serve out the remainder of his life sentence there. Considered a fugitive, Burns was arrested several times, but fought and won battles against extradition each time, including being granted a dramatic last-minute stay of extradition in 2001: after initially giving Burns to California Department of Corrections officers for return to California, Oregon State Police cars pulled over their car just two miles from the California border.
California lost track of Burns until 2001. Finding his name on a list of fugitives, California officials demanded that Burns be returned to serve out his sentence. Oregon, however, felt that Burns had rehabilitated himself and was living an honest life, and refused to extradite him.
Burns died on January 22, 2002 without having been returned to California.

Wasilla Bible Church

The Wasilla Bible Church is a non-denominational, evangelical Christian church in Wasilla, Alaska. Pastor Larry Kroon describes the congregation as "socially conservative." Wasilla Bible Church offers ministries devoted to family affairs.
Theology and practice.
The Wasilla Bible Church website lists five "Core Commitments" at its website, "The Centrality of Christ, The Authority of Scripture, The Priority of Prayer, Authenticity in our Spiritual Life, Community in our Congregational Life".
History.
The church was founded in 1977. It asked Larry Kroon to become pastor in 1978.
The church's first building in Wasilla was completed in 1979, with capacity for seating 250 people. A second story was added in 1984, then a larger sanctuary added in 1996. The property was then sold to another church, enabling Wasilla Bible Church to buy of land, also in Wasilla. A new church building was dedicated on October 1, 2006.
The church hosts up to 1000 parishioners. The church has strong recruitment practices. In "Caring for the Harvest Force in the New Millennium", authors Tom A.Steffen and Fredrick Douglas Pennoyer describe Wasilla Bible Church as doing a "superb job" of bringing teenagers "to commit to Jesus."
Arson did over $1 million in damage to the church on Friday, Dec 12, 2008.
Media scrutiny and controversy.
Following nomination of congregant and then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as candidate for Vice-President of the United States of America, Wasilla Bible Church became a focus of the media. “When a presidential candidate surprises the country with a relatively unknown choice, then all hell breaks loose,” Larry Sabato said. “It did with Ferraro, it did with Quayle, it’s happening with Palin."
A "Time" magazine correspondent reported a program insert announcing a program to help gays "overcome" their homosexuality. The pastor, Larry Kroon, responded to this article in a FoxNews interview September 9, 2008. When Fox reporter Greta Van Susteren asked for comment about inclusion of the announcement, Pastor Kroon replied, "When the subject of homosexuality comes up, people that matter to me come to mind. And over the past year, I've had different people in our congregation speak of homosexuals in ways that I did not want to hear our people speak." He went on to say, "And I wanted my people, if at all possible, to hear somebody in their tone and their manner because I don't think the church has done a very good job of speaking of this issue in a gracious tone and manner."
Fire.
On the evening of December 12, 2008, the church was damaged by a fire (confirmed as arson ) with damage estimated at about $1 million. Although some people occupied the building, no one was injured. Palin apologized to her fellow church members in case the fire was connected to "undeserved negative attention" the church has received since she became the vice presidential candidate Aug. 29.

L-655,708

L-655,708 (FG-8094) is a nootropic drug invented in 1996 by a team working for Merck, Sharp and Dohme, that was the first compound developed which acts as a subtype-selective inverse agonist at the α5 subtype of the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor. It acts as an inverse agonist at the α1, α2, α3 and α5 subtypes, but with much higher affinity for α5, and unlike newer α5 inverse agonists such as α5IA, L-655,708 exerts its subtype selectivity purely via higher binding affinity for this receptor subtype, with its efficacy as an inverse agonist being around the same at all the subtypes it binds to. 
A radiolabelled form of L-655,708 was used to map the distribution of the GABAA α5 subtype in the brain, and it was found to be expressed predominantly in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with learning and memory. Activation of this subtype is thought to be largely responsible for producing the cognitive side effects displayed by many benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine drugs, such as amnesia and difficulties with learning and memory, and so this led researchers to conclude that a drug acting as an inverse agonist at this subtype should have the opposite effect and enhance learning and memory. 
L-655,708 was indeed found to produce improved cognitive performance in animal studies, without producing the side effect of convulsions which is produced by non-selective inverse agonists like DMCM. However it was found to be anxiogenic at doses which enhanced cognition, most likely because of its inverse agonist effects on other subtypes such as α2 and α3, making it unlikely that this drug would be suitable for use as a nootropic in humans. Still, L-655,708 may find use in the clinic to combat postoperative cognitive dysfunction since administration of sub-nootropic doses of L-655,708 prevented persistent memory impairment in mice anesthetized with isoflurane.

<doc id="19182419" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19182419" title="Compiuta Donzella">
Compiuta Donzella

(La) Compiuta Donzella, called either di Firenze or Fiorentina, was the earliest woman poet of the Italian language, active in the second half of the 13th century. Three of her sonnets survive in a single manuscript, and one is half of a "tenzone". "Compiuta" may be her given name, but more probably a "senhal" (code name). Her full name translates "the accomplished young lady from Florence". Her existence was once in doubt and she was considered a construct of the poets, but this view has been discarded. 
In "A la stagion che 'l mondo foglia e fiora" ("In the season when the world sends forth leaves and flowers"), Compiuta complains of her father's choice of a husband for her. She is miserable at springtime, when other lovers are rejoicing. In "Lasciar voria lo mondo e Dio servire" ("I would like to leave the world to serve God"), she bemoans the state of the world: lack of nobility, meanness of spirit, and dishonesty. She desires to enter a convent, but her father will not let her. In her only "tenzone", "Ornato di gran pregio e di valenza", with an admiring man who wishes to meet her, she responds with pleasant interest. The famous Italian poet Guittone d'Arezzo, who mentions her by name in his fifth letter, may have addressed it to her. 
Compiuta's vocabulary was influenced by her knowledge of Occitan literature and the work of the troubadours. Thus, she contrasts "cortesia" (courtliness) with "villania" (villainy), terms borrowed from the setting of aristocratic court. "Fin pregio" (courtly virtue) and "fin'amanti" (courtly lovers) are in the courtly love tradition. Compiuta may have had access to the poems of the "trobairitz". Her place as a very early vernacular poet was not ignored by contemporaries. Mastro Torrigiano wrote two sonnets about her: one wondering whether she was unnatural (for her sex) or miraculous ("a divine sibyl"), a second praising her for surpassing the norms of her sex.

<doc id="19182454" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19182454" title="Sir Francis Geary, 1st Baronet">
Sir Francis Geary, 1st Baronet

Sir Francis Geary, 1st Baronet (1709 – 7 February 1796) was an officer of the Royal Navy. He served during the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the American War of Independence, eventually rising to the rank of Admiral.
Family and early life.
Geary was born in 1709 to a family that resided at Aberystwyth in Ceredigion but that moved to England shortly after his birth. He spent his early years at Areall Magna, near Wellington, Shropshire, and later at Cheddington, Buckinghamshire. Before joining the navy, he was a noted bellringer, a member of the Ancient Society of College Youths, he participated in several early, record-breaking peals at St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London. He entered the navy in 1727, serving as a volunteer aboard HMS "Revenge". He sailed with "Revenge" into the Baltic, as part of a squadron under Admiral Sir John Norris. On her return to Britain "Revenge" was reassigned to sail with a fleet under Sir Charles Wager that was despatched to relieve Gibraltar. Geary spent the next fifteen years with the navy gradually progressing to midshipman, and then lieutenant.
First commands.
Geary was promoted to command on 30 June 1742. He cruised off Madeira, capturing a Spanish privateer, and capturing and burning a Spanish armed ship. On 10 February 1743 he came across the Spanish chartered French merchant "Pierre Joseph". The "Pierre Joseph" was carrying a valuable cargo of silver, cochineal, indigo, hides and other goods. Geary boarded the vessel and took her as a prize. Geary then moved to command in early 1744, but was assigned to command on 17 February. He quickly departed on a cruise in company with , and on 20 February the two ships came across the French frigate "Elephant", capturing her after a short battle. Geary took part in the capture of eight French merchants later in 1744, and took part in a court-martial aboard in February 1745. He was then assigned to go to Louisbourg and support Commodore Peter Warren's assault on the fortress. He briefly participated, but was ordered home with despatches and so did not receive a share of the rewards.
Geary had by now secured a powerful patron, John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, who was then the First Lord of the Admiralty, and through Russell's actions, Geary was appointed to command the 74-gun . He was sent to reinforce Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke in the Bay of Biscay in 1747, and spent the rest of the war there, returning in 1748. He was then promoted to Commodore and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the squadron in the Medway, but relinquished the command in September that year. He married Mary Bartholomew that month and spent the peace in quiet retirement. He had purchased the estate of Polesden Lacey in 1747.
Return to service.
The increase of tensions prior to the outbreak of the Seven Years' War led to Geary's return to service in 1755. He was assigned to the 70-gun , and sailed to North America with Admiral Edward Boscawen's fleet, returning in November. At the end of 1755 Geary received orders to join the Channel Squadron under Sir Edward Hawke. During the winter of 1756 and into early 1757 Geary was part of the court-martial of Admiral John Byng. In April Geary aboard the "Somerset", and in company with , captured a number of privateers. In February 1758 Geary was given command of , moving the following year to . He sailed "Resolution" as part of the fleet under Hawke, quickly being assigned to command a squadron of ten ships of the line, two frigates and a fireship. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Blue on either 19 May or 5 June, and on 7 July moved his flag to the 90-gun . He moved again on 29 August to whilst the "Sandwich" underwent a refit, returning to "Sandwich" in late September.
Geary remained with Hawke, patrolling off the French coast, before returning with the fleet in November. The "Sandwich" had lost her main-mast in a storm, and was forced to remain in port as Hawke put to sea again. Geary was therefore unable to take part in Hawke's victory at Quiberon Bay on 20 November. Geary spent the rest of 1759 and some of 1760 patrolling off Ushant. After a stay in port, he put to sea again on 30 April to intercept a French squadron assembling at Rochefort for a voyage to the East Indies. He cruised off the port until it became clear the French had abandoned the expedition, on which he was ordered to rejoin Hawke. He returned to Britain in October and became Port Admiral at Spithead, flying his flag aboard . He oversaw preparations for the expedition against Belle Île, and those for Sir George Pocock's expedition against Cuba.
Further advances.
Geary was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the Blue on 21 October 1762. He remained at Spithead, with a brief period in command at the Nore, until the peace in 1763 ended the war. He struck his flag and entered another period of retirement until November 1769, when he became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. Increasing tensions with Spain led to his return to service and his promotion to Vice-Admiral of the Red on 17 October 1770. He retired again after the relieving of tensions led to a reduction in the navy. Though not on active service, he continued to rise through the ranks based on his seniority. He became Admiral of the Blue on 31 March 1775, and Admiral of the White on 29 January 1778. The death of Admiral Sir Charles Hardy in May 1780 led to Geary being recalled to service, despite being in poor health. He hoisted his flag aboard the 100-gun first rate , with Richard Kempenfelt as his flag captain and took command of the Channel Fleet. Geary put to sea, patrolling off Brest in the hope of preventing the joining of the French and Spanish fleets. Sails were sighted on 9 July, and Geary gave chase believing them to be one of the enemy fleets. It was found that they were instead an enemy merchant convoy. Geary engaged and captured twelve of the merchants, the rest escaping under cover of fog.
Retirement and death.
Geary returned to port in August, but was taken ill and returned to Polesden Lacey. Feeling himself unfit to retain command, he requested and received permission to resign. He was created a baronet on 3 August 1782, and died at the age of 86 on 7 February 1796.
Family and personal life.
Geary married Mary Bartholomew in 1747. The marriage produced two sons and three daughters. His eldest son, also named Francis, joined the army. He became a Cornet, but was killed in North America in an ambush in 1776. Mary died on 28 August 1778. Geary's second son, William, inherited the baronetcy on his death.

Plot.
An alcohol-free Springfield Saint Patrick's Day parade is interrupted by a brawl between the Nationalist Irish and the Unionist Northern Irish in which Homer participates. A group of hungry children steal Marge's picnic basket. She is saved by Patrick Farrelly, who gives the children a cabbage and returns the basket. Marge offers him a cupcake in gratitude, and Patrick immediately offers her a job at his bakery after eating it. Homer is taken to jail, because of his involvement in the riot. Due to his history of crime, Homer's bail is set incredibly high, and he is forced to get a bail bondsman named Lucky Jim to help him. Lucky Jim agrees to secure Homer's release from prison, as long as Homer does not skip his bail. Otherwise, he will have to deal with Wolf the Bounty Hunter, who quickly inspires Homer to become a bounty hunter himself. Homer's first mission involves pretending to sell condos on a street corner to criminals. Snake approaches Homer, who tries to take Snake down. Homer corners Snake in an alleyway, where Snake pulls out a pistol and fires a shot straight to Homer's head. Miraculously, Ned Flanders places a sheet of bulletproof glass in front of Homer, which deflects the shot. Ned attempts to convince Snake to come in quietly, unknowingly allowing Homer to sneak up behind Snake and capture him by asphyxiating him with a plastic bag. Homer convinces Ned to join him as a bounty hunting duo.
At the bakery, Marge realizes that Patrick employed her at an erotic bakery after seeing Patty and Selma pick out a suggestively-shaped cake. Marge tries to quit, but Patrick says that there is nothing wrong with what he is doing, and that many of her friends have bought cakes from the store. Patrick informs Marge that she has a gift, and Marge agrees to stay. Meanwhile, Homer and Ned are successfully pursuing several bail-jumpers. Homer, now richer, spoils his family with gifts. Marge is equally proud of her job. That evening, Homer and Ned conduct a stakeout, hoping to take in Fat Tony. When he emerges next morning, Homer and Ned chase him around Springfield and eventually capture him by crashing their car into a subway car. Disgusted by Homer's lawless capture, Ned angrily quits. Ned tries to get out of the bounty-hunting business, but agrees to hunt for Homer after Lucky Jim informs Ned that Homer has skipped his bail, while being too distracted with his new job. At first, Ned still refuses, but after he sees the other "options" of Jim (a number of amoral and sociopathic Bounty Hunters) Ned fears for Homer's sake and decides to arrests Homer by himself. 
When Homer arrives home to find Ned waiting for him, Homer declares that Ned will never take him alive. A long Parkour chase ensues, ending with the two on a beam suspended high over the ground. Homer wails that he loved Ned, but Ned counters that Homer mostly hated him. Homer scoffs that it was only because Ned holds onto his resentments. Homer jumps onto another beam, but Ned fails to land on it, gripping onto the edge of the beam. He begs Homer for help, which causes Homer to flash back to all the good times he and Ned had together; Homer finally helps Ned, but ends up tumbling over the edge of the beam himself. Shrieking, he and Ned end up landing in a pool of wet cement – which unfortunately sets before they can get out. Chief Wiggum arrives to put Homer away, but in jail, Homer has been sentenced to a short stay. On the last night of his sentence, he receives a cake from Marge to "help get him through his sentence". He opens it to find a regular pink and white frosted sheet cake that simply says "to the love of my life". At the same time, Sideshow Bob escapes from the Springfield Penitentiary.
Cultural references.
The episode title is an allusion to Steven Soderbergh's 1989 directorial debut "Sex, Lies and Videotape". Robert Forster guest stars as bail bondsman Lucky Jim in the episode, the same job his character held in the 1997 film "Jackie Brown". The bail bondsman Wolf is a parody of Duane "Dog" Chapman, the star of the series "Dog the Bounty Hunter", while one of the bounty hunters lining up to chase Homer down, before Ned takes the job, is Rose McGowan's character Cherry Darling from Robert Rodriguez's 2007 film "Planet Terror". In the opening St. Patrick's Day brawl, Marvel Comics characters The Thing and The Incredible Hulk have cameos, while before that Bart notes that he misses the IRA, a reference to the ending of their armed campaign in 2005. When Homer reminisces about the good times he and Ned had, one clip shows the two of them in a "Batman"-esque fight scene. The episode's couch gag parodies "", with Boba Fett appearing and carrying away the family frozen in carbonite as he had done to Han Solo. 
The episode features several musical references. Homer and Ned's song "Kindly Deeds Done For Free" is a parody of "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" by AC/DC. Lisa sings "Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral" to calm the fighting Irish, the Eddy Grant song "Electric Avenue" accompanies the montage of Homer and Ned hunting criminals.
Reception.
It was watched by 9.3 million people making it the most-watched Fox cartoon of the night beating "Family Guy" which was second with 9.2 million viewers. It received 247,000 fewer viewers than the previous year's season premiere. Robert Canning of IGN called it a "decent, if fun start to the twentieth season". In the end, he gave a final rating of 7.2/10. Joel Brown of "MeeVee" gave the episode a B-. Justin Gagnon of "The Daily Collegian" called the episode "worthwhile viewing for both big fans and occasional watchers and proves that even after 20 seasons the show still can dish up some fresh laughs."
Controversy.
The episode stirred controversy in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom over a brawl that occurred in the opening act of the episode. The brawl, between citizens from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, also included Bart's line "Where are the IRA when you need them?" Gregory Campbell, a British MP for East Londonderry said ""The Simpsons" is a humorous cartoon but the context of using a line like that about an organisation which caused so much death will lead people to have very mixed views, some people may take it as a light hearted reference, while others who were affected by the real life violence of the IRA and are still suffering with that legacy, will not."

Doubleclouder

Doubleclouder is a fictional character from the "Transformers" series introduced in 1988. He should not be confused with Doubledealer, who has a similar toy.
Transformers: Generation 1.
As the American "Transformers" animated series had come to an end in 1987, Doubledealer was not featured in it, but when his toy was exported to Japan and reinvented as a new character named Doubleclouder, he proceeded to appear in the Japanese-exclusive series, '. No longer a Powermaster, he was now characterised as a "Godmaster" – a human being named Clouder, bonded with one of several Transtectors, lifeless Transformer bodies scattered across Earth by the evil energy entity and self-styled Decepticon god, Devil Z.
Animated series.
Precisely who the young man called Clouder is remains somewhat unclear. There are some vague suggestions that he is connected to the American Department of Defense, since he is able to observe video taped footage of Transformer battles the DoD has been noted to acquire. Likewise, how he discovered his Transtector goes unexplained, but before he actually dons its armor-summoning Masterbraces and combines with it, he hides it in a cavern behind a waterfall. Unlike the other Godmasters, whose pairs of Masterbraces are of one specific type, Clouder has one Autobot bracelet and one Decepticon, enabling him to don two different suits of armour, and to thereby combine with and transform his Transtector in two ways.
His geekishness getting the better of him, Clouder decided to adopt his Decepticon falcon form first, considering the evil robots to be “cooler.” As the final Godmaster, he was welcomed into the fold by the Decepticon leaders, Mega and Giga, quickly proving his worth in battle against King Poseidon, staged by the distrusting Buster and Hydra. During the course of the battle, a cruise ship was damaged much to Clouder’s regret, drawing the attention of the Autobots. In the firefight which ensued, under Giga’s orders, Clouder adopted his Autobot robot form and “saved” the Autobot Minerva, joining up with the unwitting Autobots and infiltrating their base. Transmitting security diagrams to the Decepticons and setting bombs, Clouder departed to deliver the final schematics to the Decepticons, only to be found out by Metalhawk, but not before he could complete his mission. Imprisoned within the Autobot base, Clouder was trapped when his bombs detonated and the uncaring Seacons left him for dead. Rescued by the Autobots despite his misdeeds, Clouder realised the error of his ways, and requested permission from Ginrai to join their side. Ginrai agreed, but rather than stay with the Autobot forces, knowing they did not trust him, Clouder departed to work alone.
Attempting to prove his worth, Clouder approached Shuta, asking him to contact Ginrai so that he could reveal to him the location of the Decepticon base. Naturally sceptical, Shuta instead had Clouder take him, intending to call Ginrai if the information proved accurate. Unfortunately, the Decepticons – unaware of Clouder’s change in allegiance, but taking no chances – captured them both, consigning Clouder to the same fate as Shuta when they discovered he had turned on them. Ginrai was then drawn to the base to rescue them, and succeeded with help from another turncoat Decepticon, Cancer. The Autobots then initiated an all-out attack on the Decepticons' headquarters, during which Devil Z, submerged the base, leading to Clouder’s use of the flight powers of his falcon form to deliver jet boosters to fly the Autobots to safety.
The two remaining Decepticon Headmaster Juniors, Wilder and Bullhorn had also been abandoned in the submerged base, and parted ways with the Decepticon as a result. Teaming up with Cancer and Clouder as part of the Autobots’ final attack on the Decepticons, all four boys were then made victims of the power of Devil Z, who removed their Masterbraces and separated them from their Transtectors, bringing the mechs to life and discarding the humans. Clouder again displayed his military connections by acquiring for the boys an armoured vehicle that they could use for the final battle, but they arrived too late to participate in the fight, as Doubleclouder and the other Decepticons fled into space, pursued by the Autobots’ own now-living Transtectors.

Melosaurus

Melosaurus is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian. Fossils of it have been found in Russia. Fossil remains of Melosaurus uralensis were discovered at Belebei in Russia. The Paleobiology Database lists the span as Asselian-Olenekian (299 - 245 million years ago. Fossils of Melosaurus sp. were also unearthed at the site. Fossils of Melosaurus uralensis were found at the Sterlitamak site in Bashkortostan in Russia. The span of the strata is listed as Wordian (268 - 265.8 million years ago).
"Melosaurus" was 2.5–3 m. (8.52-9.8 feet) in length. It lived around ponds, lakes, rivers, and marshes. The diet of Melosaurus consisted of fish and smaller tetrapods. Melosaurus was a powerful predator. It very likely preyed upon Discosauriscus (an aquatic batrachosaur).

Australerpeton

Australerpeton is an extinct genus of archegosauroidean stereospondylomorph temnospondyl within the family Archegosauridae. When first named in 1998, the genus was placed within the new family Australerpetontidae. However, later studies questioned the systematics used in the original description and included the genus within Archegosauridae. A more recent study reassigned "Australerpeton" to the family Rhinesuchidae within the suborder Stereospondyli based on an earlier evaluation of the family. In the study, the close similarities between "Australerpeton" and archegosaurids were attributed to convergent evolution as a result of similar semi-aquatic lifestyles.

Nicholas Burt

Nicholas Burt (1621 ? — after 1689), or Birt or Burght among other variants, was a prominent English actor of the seventeenth century. In a long career, he was perhaps best known as the first actor to play the role of Othello in the Restoration era.
A "Nicholas Bert" was christened on 27 May 1621, in Norwich; the record may refer to the actor, though this is not certain. According to James Wright's "Historia Histrionica" (1699), Burt began as a boy player with the King's Men, an apprentice of John Shank (died 1636). He was with the celebrated young company Beeston's Boys in the 1638–42 period. As a young actor filling female roles, Burt gained particular notice for playing Clariana in Shirley's "Love's Cruelty".
After the theatres closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Burt, like some other actors, joined the Royalist army supporting the cause of King Charles I. Like fellow actors Charles Hart and Robert Shatterell, Burt served as an officer in the regiment of Prince Rupert in the early and mid-1640s. He most likely saw combat in the battles of Marston Moor and Naseby, and perhaps at Edgehill as well.
Once the Civil War had ended, Burt returned to acting and to the King's Men: he was one of the performers arrested on 5 February 1648, during an illegal performance of "Rollo Duke of Normandy" (he played Latorch). He was also one of the ten men who tried to restart the King's Men in December 1648, despite the Commonwealth regime's opposition to playacting.
With the Restoration, Burt's professional fortunes revived. Burt took the lead role in a 1660 production of Shakespeare's "Othello", the first staging of that play after the theatres re-opened; Walter Clun won fame for his portrayal of Iago in that production. Samuel Pepys was in the audience on 11 October 1660, and saw Burt's Othello again in 1669, as recorded in his Diary. (After that time, though, Burt lost the role to Hart.)
In 1661 Burt became one of the thirteen actors who were original sharers in the newly organized King's Company under the management of Thomas Killigrew. He continued with the King's Company until 1678. When the troupe's theatre, the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, burned down in 1672, the funds to build its replacement had to be raised largely from the actors; Burt invested £160 in the project.
Beyond Othello, Burt played a range of significant roles, in revivals of works by Shakespeare, Jonson and Fletcher:
— and contemporary works, by John Dryden:
— and by other dramatists:
The date of Burt's death is not known; he was alive at least until 1690.
