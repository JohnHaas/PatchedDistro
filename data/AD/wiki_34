History of Mumbai

The history of Mumbai recounts the growth of a collection of seven islands on the west coast of India, becoming the commercial capital of the nation, and one of the most populous cities in the world. Although human habitation existed since the Stone Age, the Kolis, a marathi fishing community, were the earliest known settlers of the islands. The Maurya Empire gained control of the islands during the 3rd century BCE, and transformed it into a centre of Hindu and Buddhist culture and religion. Later, between the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Silharas from 810 to 1260.
King Bhimdev established his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century, and brought many settlers to the islands. The Muslim rulers of Gujarat captured the islands in 1348, and they were later governed by the Gujarat Sultanate from 1391 to 1534. The Treaty of Bassein between the Portuguese viceroy Nuno da Cunha and Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate placed the islands into Portuguese possession in 1534. 
The islands suffered incursions from Mughals towards the end of the 17th century. During the mid-18th century, the city emerged as an important trading town, with maritime trade contacts with Mecca and Basra. Economic and educational development characterised the city during the 19th century with the first-ever Indian railway line beginning operations between Mumbai and neighbouring Thane in 1853. The city became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the early 20th century and was the epicentre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha of 1919 and Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946. After India's independence in 1947, the territory of Mumbai Presidency retained by India was restructured into Mumbai State. The area of Mumbai State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into Mumbai State.
In 1960, following protests from the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, the city was incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Maharashtra State from Mumbai State. The city's secular fabric was torn apart in the communal riots of 1992–93, while the bombings of 1993 caused extensive loss of life and property. The city was renamed Mumbai in 6 March 1996.
Early History.
Pre-historic period.
Geologists believe that coast of western India came into being around 100 to 80 mya after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the Réunion hotspot, a volcanic hotspot in the Earth's lithosphere near the island of Réunion. An eruption here some 66 mya is thought to have laid down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further tectonic activity in the region led to the formation of hilly islands separated by a shallow sea. Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age. The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as "Little Colaba"). The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784. By 1000 BCE, the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia. The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands. They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau, Gujarat, and Konkan. In Mumbai, there were three or four of these tribes. Their religious practices could be summed up as animism.
Age of indigenous empires.
The islands were incorporated into the Maurya Empire under Emperor Ashoka of Magadha in the third century BCE. The empire's patronage made the islands a centre of Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. Buddhist monks, scholars, and artists created the artwork, inscriptions, and sculpture of the Kanheri Caves in the mid third century BCE and Mahakali Caves. After the decline of the Maurya Empire around 185 BCE, these islands fell to the Satavahanas. The port of Sopara (present-day Nala Sopara) was an important trading centre during the first century BCE, with trade contacts with Rome. The islands were known as "Heptanesia" (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150 CE. After the end of the Satvahana rule in 250 CE, the Abhiras of Western Maharashtra and Vakatakas of Vidarbha held dominion over the islands. The Abhiras ruled for 167 years, till around 417 CE. The Kalachuris of Central India ruled the islands during the fifth century, which were then acquired by the Mauryas of Konkan in the sixth and early part of the seventh century. The Mauryas were feudatories of Kalachuris, and the Jogeshwari Caves were constructed during their regime between 520 to 525. The Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes visited Kalyan (near Mumbai) during 530–550. The Elephanta Caves also dates back to the sixth century. Christianity arrived in the islands during the sixth century, when the Nestorian Church made its presence in India. The Mauryan presence ended when the Chalukyas of Badami in Karnataka under Pulakesi II invaded the islands in 610. Dantidurga of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty of Karnataka conquered the islands during 749–750.
The Silhara dynasty of Konkan ruled the region between 810 and 1260. The Walkeshwar Temple was constructed during the 10th century and the Banganga Tank during the 12the century under the patronage of the Silhara rulers. The Italian traveler Marco Polo's fleet of thirteen Chinese ships passed through Mumbai Harbour during May — September 1292. King Bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in "Mahikawati" (present day Mahim). He belonged to either the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri in Maharashtra or the Anahilavada dynasty of Gujarat. He built the first Babulnath temple in the region and introduced many fruit-bearing trees, including coconut palms to the islands. The Pathare Prabhus, one of the earliest settlers of the city, were brought to Mahim from Patan and other parts of Saurashtra in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev during his reign. He is also supposed to have brought Palshis, Pachkalshis, Bhandaris, Vadvals, Bhois, Agris and Brahmins to these islands. After his death in 1303, he was succeeded by his son Pratapbimba, who built his capital at Marol in Salsette, which he named Pratappur. The islands were wrested from Pratapbimba's control by Mubarak Khan, a self-proclaimed regent of the Khilji dynasty, who occupied Mahim and Salsette in 1318. Pratapbimba later reconquered the islands which he ruled till 1331. Later, his brother-in-law Nagardev for 17 years till 1348. The islands came under the control of the Muslim rulers of Gujarat in 1348, ending the sovereignty of Hindu rulers over the islands.
Islamic period.
The islands were under Muslim rule from 1348 to 1391. After the establishment of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1391, Muzaffar Shah I was appointed viceroy of north Konkan. For the administration of the islands, he appointed a governor for Mahim. During the reign of Ahmad Shah I (1411–1443), Malik-us-Sharq was appointed governor of Mahim, and in addition to instituting a proper survey of the islands, he improved the existing revenue system of the islands. During the early 15th century, the Bhandaris seized the island of Mahim from the Sultanate and ruled it for eight years. It was reconquered by Rai Qutb of the Gujarat Sultanate. Firishta, a Persian historian, recorded that by 1429 the seat of government of the Gujarat Sultanate in north Konkan had transferred from Thane to Mahim. On Rai Qutb's death in 1429–1430, Ahmad Shah I Wali of the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan captured Salsette and Mahim.
Ahmad Shah I retaliated by sending his son Jafar Khan to recapture the lost territory. Jafar emerged victorious in the battle fought with Ahmad Shah I Wali. In 1431, Mahim was recaptured by the Sultanate of Gujarat. The Sultanate's patronage led to the construction of many mosques, prominent being the Haji Ali Dargah in Mahim, built in honour the Muslim saint Haji Ali in 1431. After the death of Kutb Khan, the Gujarat commandant of Mahim, Ahmad Shah I Wali again despatched a large army to capture Mahim. Ahmad Shah I responded with a large army and navy under Jafar Khan leading to the defeat of Ahmad Shah I Wali. During 1491–1494, the islands suffered sea piracies from Bahadur Khan Gilani, a nobleman of the Bahamani Sultanate. After the end of the Bahamani Sultanate, Bahadur Khan Gilani and Mahmud Gavan (1482–1518) broke out in rebellion at the port of Dabhol and conquered the islands along with the whole of Konkan. Portuguese explorer Francisco de Almeida's ship sailed into the deep natural harbour of the island in 1508, and he called it "Bom Bahia" (Good Bay). However, the Portuguese paid their first visit to the islands on 21 January 1509, when they landed at Mahim after capturing a Gujarat barge in the Mahim creek. After a series of attacks by the Gujarat Sultanate, the islands were recaptured by Sultan Bahadur Shah.
In 1526, the Portuguese established their factory at Bassein. During 1528–29, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio seized the fort of Mahim from the Gujarat Sultanate, when the King was at war with Nizam-ul-mulk, the emperor of Chaul, a town south of the islands. Bahadur Shah had grown apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun and he was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the islands of Mumbai and Bassein were offered to the Portuguese. Bassein and the seven islands were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha, Viceroy of Portuguese India, on 25 October 1535, ending the Islamic rule in Mumbai.
Portuguese period.
The Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their religious orders in Bombay. The islands were leased to Mestre Diogo in 1534. The "San Miguel" (St. Michael Church) in Mahim, one of the oldest churches in Bombay, was built by the Portuguese in 1540. Parel, Wadala, Sion, and Worli were granted to Manuel Serrão between 1545 and 1548, during the viceroyalty of João de Castro. Mazagaon was granted to Antonio Pessoa in 1547. Salsette was granted for three years to João Rodrigues Dantas, Cosme Corres, and Manuel Corres. Trombay and Chembur were granted to Dom Roque Tello de Menezes, and the Island of Pory (Elephanta Island) to João Pirez in 1548. Garcia de Orta, a Portuguese physician and botanist, was granted the possession of Bombay in 1554 by viceroy Pedro Mascarenhas.
The Portuguese encouraged intermarriage with the local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started proselytising the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as "Portuguese Christians", though they were Nestorian Christians who had only recently established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.
The annexation of Portugal by Spain in 1580 opened the way for other European powers to follow the spice routes to India. The Dutch arrived first, closely followed by the British. The first English merchants arrived in Bombay in November 1583, and travelled through Bassein, Thane, and Chaul. The Portuguese Franciscans had obtained practical control of Salsette and Mahim by 1585, and built "Nossa Senhora de Bom Concelho" (Our Lady of Good Counsel) at Sion and "Nossa Senhora de Salvação" (Our Lady of Salvation) at Dadar in 1596. The Battle of Swally was fought between the British and the Portuguese at Surat in 1612 for the possession of Bombay. Dorabji Nanabhoy, a trader, was the first Parsi to settle in Bombay in 1640. Castella de Aguada (Fort of the Waterpoint) was built by the Portuguese at Bandra in 1640 as a watchtower overlooking the Mahim Bay, the Arabian Sea and the southern island of Mahim. The growing power of the Dutch by the middle of the seventeenth century forced the Surat Council of the British Empire to acquire Bombay from King John IV of Portugal in 1659. The marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Portugal on 8 May 1661 placed Bombay in British possession as a part of Catherine's dowry to Charles.
British period.
Struggle with native powers.
On 19 March 1662, Abraham Shipman was appointed the first Governor and General of the city, and his fleet arrived in Bombay in September and October 1662. On being asked to hand over Bombay and Salsette to the English, the Portuguese Governor contended that the island of Bombay alone had been ceded, and alleging irregularity in the patent, he refused to give up even Bombay. The Portuguese Viceroy declined to interfere and Shipman was prevented from landing in Bombay. He was forced to retire to the island of Anjediva in North Canara and died there in October 1664. In November 1664, Shipman's successor Humphrey Cooke agreed to accept Bombay without its dependencies. However, Salsette, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. Later, Cooke managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala for the English. On 21 September 1668, the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, led to the transfer of Bombay from Charles II to the English East India Company for an annual rent of £10 (equivalent retail price index of £1,226 in 2007). The Company immediately set about the task of opening up the islands by constructing a quay and warehouses. A customs house was also built. Fortifications were built around Bombay Castle. A Judge-Advocate was appointed for the purpose of civil administration. George Oxenden became the first Governor of Bombay under the English East India Company on 23 September 1668. Gerald Aungier, who was appointed Governor of Bombay on July 1669, established the first mint in Bombay in 1670. He offered various business incentives, which attracted Parsis, Goans, Jews, Dawoodi Bohras, Gujarati Banias from Surat and Diu, and Brahmins from Salsette. He also planned extensive fortifications in the city from Dongri in the north to Mendham's Point (near present day Lion Gate) in the south. The harbour was also developed during his governorship, with space for the berthing of 20 ships. In 1670, the Parsi businessman Bhimjee Parikh imported the first printing press into Bombay. Between 1661 and 1675 there was a sixfold increase in population from 10,000 to 60,000. Yakut Khan, the Siddi admiral of the Mughal Empire, landed at Bombay in October 1672 and ravaged the local inhabitants there. On 20 February 1673, Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India attacked Bombay, but the attack was resisted by Aungier. On 10 October 1673, the Siddi admiral Sambal entered Bombay and destroyed the Pen and Nagothana rivers, which were very important for the English and the Maratha King Shivaji. The Treaty of Westminster concluded between England and the Netherlands in 1674, relieved the British settlements in Bombay of further apprehension from the Dutch. In 1686, the Company shifted its main holdings from Surat to Bombay, which had become the administrative centre of all the west coast settlements then. Bombay was placed at the head of all the Company's establishments in India.
Yakut Khan landed at Sewri on 14 February 1689, and razed the Mazagon Fort in June 1690. After a payment made by the British to Aurangzeb, the ruler of the Mughal Empire, Yakut evacuated Bombay on 8 June 1690. The arrival of many Indian and British merchants led to the development of Bombay's trade by the end of the seventeenth century. Soon it was trading in salt, rice, ivory, cloth, lead and sword blades with many Indian ports as well as with the Arabian cities of Mecca and Basra. By 1710, the construction of Bombay Castle was finished, which fortified the islands from sea attacks by European pirates and the Marathas. By 26 December 1715, Charles Boone assumed the Governorship of Bombay. He implemented Aungier's plans for the fortification of the island, and had walls built from Dongri in the north to Mendham's point in the south. He established the Marine force, and constructed the St. Thomas Cathedral in 1718, which was the first Anglican Church in Bombay. In 1728, a Mayor's court was established in Bombay and the first reclamation was started which was a temporary work in Mahalaxmi, on the creek separating Bombay from Worli. The shipbuilding industry started in Bombay in 1735 and soon the Naval Dockyard was established in the same year.
In 1737, Salsette was captured from the Portuguese by Maratha Baji Rao I and the province of Bassein was ceded in 1739. The Maratha victory forced the British to push settlements within the fort walls of the city. Under new building rules set up in 1748, many houses were demolished and the population was redistributed, partially on newly reclaimed land. Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia, a member of the Wadia family of shipwrights and naval architects from Surat, built the Bombay Dock in 1750, which was the first dry dock to be commissioned in Asia. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Bombay began to grow into a major trading town and soon Bhandaris from Chaul in Maharashtra, Vanjaris from the Western Ghat mountain ranges of Maharashtra, Africans from Madagascar, Bhatias from Rajasthan, Vaishya Vanis, Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Daivajnas from konkan, ironsmiths and weavers from Gujarat migrated to the islands. In 1769, Fort George was built on the site of the Dongri Fort and in 1770, the Mazagaon docks were built. The British occupied Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja on 28 December 1774. Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja were formally ceded to the British East India Company by the Treaty of Salbai signed in 1782, while Bassein and its dependencies were restored to Raghunathrao of the Maratha Empire. Although Salsette was under the British, but the introduction of contraband goods from Salsette to other parts of Bombay was prevented. The goods were subjected to Maratha regulations with respect to taxes and a 30% toll was levied on all goods into the city from Salsette.
In 1782, William Hornby assumed the office of Governor of Bombay, and initiated the Hornby Vellard engineering project of uniting the seven islands into a single landmass. The purpose of this project was to block the Worli creek and prevent the low-lying areas of Bombay from being flooded at high tide. However, the project was rejected by the British East India Company in 1783. In 1784, the Hornby Vellard project was completed and soon reclamations at Worli and Mahalaxmi followed. The history of journalism in Bombay commenced with publication of the "Bombay Herald" in 1789 and the "Bombay Courier" in 1790. In 1795, the Maratha army defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad. Following this, many artisans and construction workers from Andhra Pradesh migrated to Bombay and settled into the flats which were constructed by the Hornby Vellard. These workers where called Kamathis, and their enclave was called Kamathipura. The construction of the Sion Causeway (Duncan Causeway) commenced in 1798. The construction of the Sion Causeway was completed in 1802 by Governor Jonathan Duncan. It connected Bombay Island to Kurla in Salsette. On 17 February 1803, a fire raged through the town, razing many localities around the Old Fort, subsequently the British had to plan a new town with wider roads. On May 1804, Bombay was hit by a severe famine, which led to a large scale emigration. On 5 November 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone defeated Bajirao II, the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, in the Battle of Kirkee which took place on the Deccan Plateau. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan witnessed the freedom of Bombay from all attacks by native powers.
City development.
The educational and economic progress of the city began with the Company's military successes in the Deccan. The Wellington Pier (Apollo Bunder) in the north of Colaba was opened for passenger traffic in 1819 and the Elphinstone High School was established in 1822. Bombay was hit by a water famine in 1824. The construction of the new mint commenced in 1825. With the construction of a good carriage road up the Bhor Ghat during the regimes of Mountstuart Elphinstone and Sir John Malcolm gave better access from Bombay to the Deccan. This road, which was opened on 10 November 1830, facilitated trade in a large measure. By 1830, regular communication with England started by steamers navigating the Red and Mediterranean Sea. In July 1832, the Parsi riots took place in consequence of a Government order for the destruction of pariah dogs which infested the city. The Asiatic Society of Bombay (Town Hall) was completed in 1833, and the Elphinstone College was built in 1835. In 1836, the Chamber of Commerce was established.
In 1838, the islands of Colaba and Little Colaba were connected to Bombay by the Colaba Causeway. In the same year, monthly communication was established between Bombay and London. The Bank of Bombay, the oldest bank in the city, was established in 1840, and the Bank of Western India in 1842. The Cotton Exchange was established in Cotton Green in 1844. Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy funded the construction of the Mahim Causeway, to connect Mahim to Bandra and the work was completed in 1845. The Commercial Bank of India, established in 1845, issued exotic notes with an interblend of Western and Eastern Motifs. On 3 November 1845, the Grant Medical College and hospital, the third in the country, was founded by Governor Robert Grant. The earliest riots occurred at Mahim in 1850, in consequence of a dispute between two rival factions of Khojas. Riots broke out between Muslims and Parsis in October 1851, in consequence of an ill-advised article on Prophet Muhammad which appeared in the "Chitra Gnyan Darpan" newspaper. The first political organization of the Bombay Presidency, the Bombay Association, was started on 26 August 1852, to vent public grievances to the British. The first-ever Indian railway line began operations between Bombay and neighbouring Thane over a distance of 21 miles on 16 April 1853. The Bombay Spinning and Weaving Company was the first cotton mill to be established in the city on 7 July 1854 at Tardeo in Central Bombay. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&CI) was incorporated in 1855.
The University of Bombay was the first modern institution of higher education to be established in India in 1857. The Commercial Bank, the Chartered Mercantile, the Agra and United Service, the Chartered and the Central Bank of Western India were established in Bombay attracting a considerable industrial population. The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 increased the demand for cotton in the West, and led to an enormous increase in cotton-trade. The Victoria Gardens was opened to the public in 1862. The Bombay Shipping and Iron Shipping Companies were started in 1863 to make Bombay merchants independent of the English. The Bombay Coast and River Steam Navigation Company was established in 1866 for the maintenance of steam ferries between Bombay and the nearby islands; while the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 revolutionized the marine trade of Bombay. The Bombay Municipal Corporation was established in 1872, providing a modern framework of governance for the rapidly-growing city. The Bombay Port Trust was promulgated in 1870 for the development and administration of the port. Tramway communication was instituted in 1873. The Bombay Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), originally set up as a tramway company: "Bombay Tramway Company Limited", was established in 1873. Violent Parsi-Muslim riots again broke out in February 1874, which were caused by an article on Prophet Muhammad published by a Parsi resident. The Bombay Gymkhana was formed in 1875. The Bombay Stock Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in Asia, was established in 1875. Electricity arrived in Bombay in 1882 and Crawford Market was the first establishment to be lit up by electricity. The Bombay Natural History Society was founded in 1883. Bombay Time, one of the two official time zones in British India, was established in 1884 during the International Meridian Conference held at Washington, D.C in the United States. Bombay time was set at 4 hours and 51 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) using the 75th east meridian. The Princess Dock was built in 1885 as part of a scheme for improving the whole foreshore of the Bombay harbour.
Indian freedom movement.
The growth of political consciousness started after the establishment of the Bombay Presidency Association on 31 January 1885. The Bombay Millowners' Association was formed in February 1875 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in order to protect interests of workers threatened by possible factory and tariff legislation by the British. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28–31 December 1885. The Bombay Municipal Act was enacted in 1888 which gave the British Government wide powers of interference in civic matters. The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, one of the finest stations in the world, was completed in May 1888. The concept of "Dabbawalas" (lunch box delivery man) originated in the 1890s when British people who came to Bombay did not like the local food. So the "Dabbawala" service was set up to bring lunch to these people in their workplace straight from their home. On 11 August 1893, a serious communal riot took place between the Hindus and Muslims, when a Shiva temple was attacked by Muslims in Bombay. 75 people were killed and 350 were injured. In September 1896, Bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. Around 850,000, amounting to half of the population, fled Bombay during this time. On 9 March 1898, there was a serious riot which started with a sudden outbreak of hostility against the measures adopted by Government for suppression of plague. The riot led to a strike of dock and railway workers which paralysed the city for a few days. The significant results of the plague was the creation of the Bombay City Improvement Trust on 9 December 1898 and the Haffkine Institute on 10 January 1899 by Waldemar Haffkine. The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay, was formulated in 1899–1900 by the Bombay City Improvement Trust to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics. The cotton mill industry was adversely affected during 1900 and 1901 due to the flight of workers because of the plague.
The Partition of Bengal in 1905 initiated the Swadeshi movement, which led to the boycotting of British goods in India. On 22 July 1908, Lokmanya Tilak, the principal advocate of the Swadeshi movement in Bombay, was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment, on the charge of writing inflammatory articles against the Government in his newspaper "Kesari". The arrest led to huge scale protests across the city. The "Bombay Chronicle" started by Pherozeshah Mehta, the leader of the Indian National Congress, in 1910, played an important role in the national movement until India's Independence. Lord Willingdon convened the Provincial War Conference at Bombay on 10 June 1918, whose objective was to seek the co-operation of the people in the World War I measures which the British Government thought it necessary to take in the Bombay Presidency. The conference was followed by huge rallies across the city. The worldwide influenza epidemic raged through Bombay from September to December 1918, causing hundreds of deaths per day. The Lord Willingdon Memorial incident of December 1918 saw the handicap of Home Rulers in Bombay. The first important strike in the textile industry in Bombay began in January 1919. Bombay was the main centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha movement started by Mahatma Gandhi from February — April 1919. The movement was started as a result of the Rowlatt Act, which indefinitely extended emergency measures during World War I in order to control public unrest.
Following World War I, which saw large movement of India troops, supplies, arms and industrial goods to and from Bombay, the city life was shut down many times during the Non-cooperation movement from 1920 to 1922. In 1926, the Back Bay scandal occurred, when the Bombay Development Department under the British reclaimed the Back Bay area in Bombay after the financial crisis incidental to the post-war slump in the city. The first electric locomotives in India were put into service from Victoria Terminus to Kurla in 1925. In the late 1920s, many Persians migrated to Bombay from Yazd to escape the drought in Iran. In the early 1930s, the nationwide Civil disobedience movement against the British Salt tax spread to Bombay. Vile Parle was the headquarters of the movement in Bombay under Jamnalal Bajaj. On 15 October 1932 industrialist and aviator J.R.D. Tata pioneered civil aviation in Bombay by flying a plane from Karachi to Bombay. Bombay was affected by the Great Depression of 1929, which saw a stagnation of mill industry and economy from 1933 to 1939. With World War II, the movements of thousands of troops, military and industrial goods and the fleet of the Royal Indian Navy made Bombay an important military base for the battles being fought in West Asia and South East Asia. The climatic Quit India rebellion was promulgated on 7 August 1942 by the Congress in a public meeting at Gowalia Tank. The Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 18 February 1946 in Bombay marked the first and most serious revolt by the Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy against British rule. On 15 August 1947, finally India was declared independent. The last British troops to leave India, the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the arcade of the Gateway of India in Bombay on 28 February 1948, ending the 282 year long period of the British in Bombay .
Independent India.
20th century.
After the Partition of India on 15 August 1947, over 100,000 Sindhi refugees from the newly created Pakistan were relocated in the military camps five kilometres from Kalyan in the Bombay metropolitan region. It was converted into a township in 1949, and named Ulhasnagar by the then Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari. In April 1950, Greater Bombay District came into existence with the merger of Bombay Suburbs and Bombay City. It spanned an area of and inhabited 23.39 lakhs of people in 1951. The Municipal Corporation limits were extended up to Jogeshwari along the Western Railway and Bhandup along the Central Railway. This limit was further extended in February 1957 up to Dahisar along the Western Railway and Mulund on the Central Railway. In the 1955 "Lok Sabha" discussions, when Bombay State was being re-organised along linguistic lines into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, there was a demand from the Congress, that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. But the States Reorganisation Committee recommended a bi-lingual state for Maharashtra-Gujarat, with Bombay as its capital. However, the Samyukta Maharashtra movement opposed this, and insisted that Bombay be declared the capital of Maharashtra. The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay was established in 1958 at Powai, a northern suburb of Bombay. Following protests by the Samyukta Maharashtra movement in which 105 people were killed by police firing, Maharashtra State was formed with Bombay as its capital on 1 May 1960. Flora Fountain was renamed Hutatma Chowk ("Martyr's Square") as a memorial to the Samyukta Maharashtra movement.
In the early 1960s, the Gujarati and Marwaris communities owned majority of the industry and trade enterprises in the city, while the white-collar jobs were mainly sought by the South Indian migrants to the city. The Shiv Sena party was established on 19 June 1966 by Bombay cartoonist Bal Thackeray, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalization of the native Marathi people in their native state Maharashtra. In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena cadres became involved in various attacks against the South Indian communities, vandalising South Indian restaurants and pressuring employers to hire Marathis. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. During the 1970 Bombay-Bhiwandi riots, many Muslim places of worship were attacked by Shiv sena activists. During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and south western coast of India, after introduction of ships by the London based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Goan and Mangalorean Catholics to Bombay.
Nehru Centre was established in 1972 at Worli in Bombay. The Bombay Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) was set up on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Bombay metropolitan region. Nehru Science Centre, India's largest interactive science centre, was established in 1972 at Worli in Bombay. In August 1979, a sister township of New Bombay was founded by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across Thane and Raigad districts to help the dispersal and control of Bombay's population. The Great Bombay Textile Strike was called on 18 January 1982 by trade union leader Dutta Samant, where nearly 250,000 workers and more than 50 textile mills in Bombay went on strike. On 17 May 1984, riots broke out in Bombay, Thane, and Bhiwandi after a saffron flag was placed at the top of a mosque. 278 were killed and 1,118 were wounded. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port was commissioned on 26 May 1989 at Nhava Sheva with a view to de-congest Bombay Harbour and to serve as a hub port for the city. In December 1992 – January 93, over 1,000 people were killed and the city paralyzed by communal riots between the Hindus and the Muslims caused by the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. A series of 13 co-ordinated bomb explosions took place in Bombay on 12 March 1993, which resulted in 257 deaths and 700 injuries. The attacks were believed to be orchestrated by mafia don Dawood Ibrahim in retaliation for the Babri Mosque demolition. In 1996, the newly elected Shiv Sena-led government renamed the city of Bombay to the native name Mumbai, after the Koli Goddess Mumbadevi. Soon colonial British names were shed to assert or reassert local names, such as Victoria Terminus being renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus on 4 March 1996, after the 17th century Marathi King Shivaji.
21st century.
During the 21st century, the city suffered several bombings. On 6 December 2002, a bomb placed under a seat of an empty BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) bus exploded near Ghatkopar station in Mumbai. Around 2 people were killed and 28 were injured. The bombing occurred on the tenth anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. On 27 January 2003, a bomb placed on a bicycle exploded near the Vile Parle station in Mumbai. The bomb killed 1 and injured 25. The blast occurred a day ahead of the visit of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India to the city. On 13 March 2003, a bomb exploded in a train compartment, as the train was entering the Mulund station in Mumbai. 10 people were killed and 70 were injured. The blast occurred a day after the tenth anniversary of the 1993 Bombay bombings. On 28 July 2003, a bomb placed under a seat of a BEST bus exploded in Ghatkopar. The bomb killed 4 people and injured 32. On 25 August 2003, two blasts in South Mumbai – one near the Gateway of India and the other at Zaveri Bazaar in Kalbadevi occurred. At least 44 people were killed and 150 injured. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it had been hinted that the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba was behind the attacks.
Mumbai was lashed by torrential rains on 26–27 July 2005, during which the city was brought to a complete standstill. The city received 37 inches (940 millimeters) of rain in 24 hours — the most any Indian city has ever received in a single day. Around 83 people were killed. On 11 July 2006, a series of seven bomb blasts took place over a period of 11 minutes on the Suburban Railway in Mumbai at Khar, Mahim, Matunga, Jogeshwari, Borivali, and one between Khar and Santa Cruz. 209 people were killed and over 700 were injured. According to Mumbai Police, the bombings were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). In 2008, the city experienced xenophobic attacks by the activists of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) under Raj Thackeray on the North Indian migrants in Mumbai. Attacks included assault on North Indian taxi drivers and damage of their vehicles. There were a series of ten coordinated terrorist attacks by 10 armed Pakistani men using automatic weapons and grenades which began on 26 November 2008 and ended on 29 November 2008. The attacks resulted in 164 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several important buildings. The city again saw a series of three coordinated bomb explosions at different locations on 13 July 2011 between 18:54 and 19:06 IST. The blasts occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar, which left 26 killed, and 130 injured. The city's Wankhede Stadium was the venue for 2011 Cricket World Cup final, where India emerged as a champion for the second time after the 1983 Cricket World Cup.

Atli the Slender

Atli the Slender (Old Norse: Atli hinn Mjovi) was a ninth-century Norwegian jarl mentioned in several Old Norse sources, including "Heimskringla" and "Egils saga".
Atli was the son of Hundolf, a jarl of Gaular in Fjordane. His sister was Solvor Hundolfsdottir, the wife of King Harald Goldbeard of Sogn. He became friends with King Halfdan the Black of Vestfold and accompanied him on a number of his expeditions. In particular, Atli accompanied Halfdan when, following the death of Halfdan's father in law Harald Goldbeard and Halfdan's son Harald, the Vestfolder king led an expedition to take possession of Sogn as their heir. Halfdan made Atli jarl over all of Sogn.
Atli continued to govern Sogn into the reign of Halfdan's son Harald Fairhair. He is mentioned in "Egils saga" in connection with the famous skald Olvir Hnufa, the eponymous Egill's great-uncle. At a thing in Gaular, Olvir fell in love with Solveig Atladottir, Atli's daughter. The jarl refused Olvir permission to marry the girl, but he was so smitten that he abandoned his Viking life to be near her. A skald of some talent, he composed a number of love poems for Solveig. For reasons not revealed in the saga, but probably related to his courtship of Solveig, Olvir was attacked and nearly killed in his home by Solveig's brothers shortly after King Harald's conquest of Møre.
Atli's sons, Hallstein, Holmstein and Herstein, were famous Vikings who sailed with the foster brothers Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson and Ingólfr Arnarson. They fell out, however, over Ingolfur's sister Helga, who married Hjörleifur. In the ensuing blood feud two of Atli's sons were killed and their erstwhile allies fled Norway for Iceland, becoming the first permanent settlers there.
After Harald Fairhair conquered Møre and Fjordane he assigned the governance of the former to Rognvald Eysteinsson and the latter to Håkon Grjotgardsson. Hákon and Atli soon came into conflict over Sogn and fought a battle at Fjalir in Stafaness Bay, in which Håkon was killed. Atli was severely wounded in the battle and taken to a nearby island, where he died. 
Eyvindr skáldaspillir wrote a verse about the battle which is preserved in "Heimskringla":

Bill (Show Boat)

"Bill" is a song heard in Act II of Kern and Hammerstein's classic 1927 musical "Show Boat". The song was written for Kern and P.G. Wodehouse's 1917 musical "Oh, Lady! Lady!!" for Vivienne Segal to perform, but withdrawn because it was considered too melancholy for that show. However, when Kern and Hammerstein were at work on the serious and somewhat tragic "Show Boat", they decided that the song would be perfect for a nightclub scene in the show. Hammerstein revised Wodehouse's original lyrics somewhat (though he would always give full credit to Wodehouse for the song and take none for himself), and the song was given to real-life nightclub singer Helen Morgan, who portrayed the mulatto Julie in "Show Boat", to sing.
The song is sung only once in the show and is highly emotional, with the singer supposedly on the verge of tears. It is sung in an audition scene in Act II. At the Trocadero, a local Chicago night club, Julie LaVerne, the former leading lady of the show boat, is the featured singer. Julie, who is of mixed blood, has been permanently abandoned by her white husband, Steve Baker, years after the two were forced to leave the show boat because of their interracial, and illegal, marriage. Despondent, Julie has taken to drink and is quickly becoming an alcoholic. At the urging of Jim Green, the nightclub manager, Julie rehearses the song "Bill", which is a woman's confession of deep love for a less-than-perfect man named Bill, and it is clear that the emotion that Julie puts into the song comes from the fact that she is really thinking about her husband as she sings.
"Bill" became one of Helen Morgan's signature songs, and onstage she sang it in her trademark style sitting atop a piano. Although the song is sung only once in "Show Boat" and never reprised, it has become one of the musical's most famous.
On film, Helen Morgan sang "Bill" both in the prologue to the 1929 part-talkie film version of "Show Boat" and in the classic 1936 film version. Lena Horne was filmed singing it for the Jerome Kern biopic "Till the Clouds Roll By", but the scene was eventually cut, and Ava Gardner, using the dubbed-in voice of Annette Warren, sang it in the 1951 Technicolor remake of "Show Boat". Gardner's own voice can be heard on the soundtrack record.
Shirley Bassey recorded the song for the 1959 Studio Cast Album of "Show Boat".
The song was a regular part of Dorothy Lamour's repertoire. Lamour frequently sang it on radio and in concert and recorded it in 1958.

Painting the Invisible Man

Rita Schiano's novel, Painting the Invisible Man, was influenced by the 1976 murder of her father. Like Anna Matteo, the character in the story, Schiano was researching the archives of her hometown newspaper for a client when she made a keying error that led to the discovery of thirty-seven articles from the 1990s referencing her father, murdered in 1976. One such headline mentioned FBI surveillance tapes of a man bragging about getting away with murder twenty years before. Written as a contemporary historical fiction rather than as a memoir, Schiano confronted intensely challenging and personal issues and created a compelling story. It was published September 2007 by The Reed Edwards Company.

Diocese of Urbania-Sant'Angelo in Vado

The former Italian Catholic Diocese of Urbania-Sant’Angelo in Vado, in the Marche, existed from 1836 to 1986. In the latter year, it was united into the Archdiocese of Urbino, to form the Archdiocese of Urbino-Urbania-Sant'Angelo in Vado.
History.
Sant'Angelo in Vado in 1635 became a city, and then an episcopal see. Urbania in 1280 was demolished by the Ghibellines. It was restored again by the Dominican bishop, Guglielmo Durante and called Castel Durante; it was included in the Duchy of Urbino, and contained a magnificent ducal palace. I
At the beginning of 1635 S. Angelo was an archpresbyterate nullius, subject to the Abbot of the Monastery of S. Cristoforo of Castel Durante, to whom the Archpresbyterate of Castel Durante was also subject. In that year Pope Urban VIII erected the two towns into dioceses, changing the name of Castel Durante to Urbania, and uniting them aeque principaliter under Onorato degli Onorati, who governed it for forty-eight years. Other bishops were: Gian. Vincenzo Castelli, O.P. (1711), who restored the cathedral of Urbania, and Paolo Zamperoli, O.P. (1779) sent into exile under Napoleon, dying there.

Lindsay Bury

Lindsay Bury (9 July 1857 – 30 October 1935) was an English amateur footballer who, playing as a full back, helped the Old Etonians win the FA Cup in 1879 and made two appearances for England in the 1870s. He also played cricket for Hampshire in 1877.
Education.
Bury was born in Withington, Manchester and was educated at Eton College. He played for the college football team in 1875 and 1876, before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he earned a blue for football in both 1877 and 1878, as well as a blue for cricket in 1877. He was also especially noted for his sprinting and hammer throwing, and won athletics blues in 1878, 1879 and 1880. He graduated BA in the latter year.
Football career.
Bury appeared regularly for the Old Etonians and for Cambridge University. His first England appearance came as left-back on 3 March 1877, when he was still at University. He was one of seven débutantes in the England team to play Scotland at the Kennington Oval. According to Philip Gibbons, in the 1870s the England side "tended to be chosen on availability rather than skill alone" The change in the England line-up made little difference to England's performance against the Scots who won the game 3–1, with England's consolation goal coming from Alfred Lyttelton; the Scots thus inflicted England's first international defeat on home soil in the sixth appearance between the two countries.
Along with most of the other international débutantes, he was not selected for the next England match, but he was recalled for the first ever match between England and Wales on 18 January 1879. As Wales had been defeated 9–0 in their previous international against Scotland, England were confident of victory and selected an inexperienced eleven, including five débutantes. The match was played at the Kennington Oval in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious snowfall both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that William Clegg turned up 20 minutes late for the game. Clegg, a solicitor, was working late on a case (the trial of Charles Peace, the Banner Cross murderer) and was unable to leave Sheffield for London on the Friday night. The next morning, the southbound train with Clegg on it, was delayed by heavy snow. The match started without Clegg and England played with ten men until he arrived. Despite this, England won the match by two goals to one, with Herbert Whitfeld and Thomas Sorby scoring for England.
In 1879, he helped the Old Etonians reach the Cup Final where they met Clapham Rovers at Kennington Oval on 29 March. Bury and his team captain, Arthur Kinnaird were required to call on "their well-known powers ... to keep the enemy out of their quarters". The match was dominated by the defences and was goalless at half-time. In the second half, Charles Clerke scored for the Old Etonians "following an excellent run by Goodhart" and "arguably the poorest Cup Final to date" ended in a 1–0 victory for the Old Etonians.
Bury served on The Football Association committee in 1878.
He also played for Swifts F.C. and in representative matches for The South v The North.
Cricket career.
He played cricket for Cambridge University in 1877 and 1878, and made one appearance for Hampshire against Derbyshire in July 1877. He was a right-hand batsman and a fast right-arm bowler. In his nine first class appearances, he totalled 115 runs at an average of 9.58 and claimed 18 wickets at an average of 13.83.
Life after sport.
He later emigrated to Florida where he became an orange planter, possibly in association with his former Eton College and Cambridge University compatriot Rupert Anderson who had gone to Florida at the same time.
Bury subsequently returned to England, settling near Bradfield, Berkshire where he died, aged seventy-eight, on 30 October 1935. He was a J.P. for that county. In the First World War he volunteered to serve with the French Red Cross.

Sonya Rapoport

Sonya Rapoport (born October 6, 1923) is an American conceptual/digital artist and New media artist who has created computer-assisted interactive installations and participatory web-based artworks.
Early life.
Sonya (née Goldberg) was born on October 6, 1923 in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts. There, she regularly attended Saturday classes at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts where she studied with Karl Zerbe. She spent her childhood summers at the art colony in Ogunquit, Maine.
Education.
She attended MassArt (Massachusetts College of Art) for two years from 1941 to 1942 and during this period she met Henry Rapoport while he was a Ph.D. Candidate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1942 she was enrolled in a summer philosophy program taught by John Dewey in New York at Columbia University. She then returned to Massachusetts and studied at Boston University from 1943 to 1944, majoring in biology.
She married Henry Rapoport in 1944 and the couple moved to New York. Sonya Rapoport enrolled at New York University and, in 1946, received her B.A. in Labor Economics. She then attended the Art Students League of New York where she studied with Reginald Marsh. In September 1946 the couple moved again, this time to Washington, D.C., where Rapoport entered the Corcoran School of Art to study figurative art and oil painting.
In late September 1947, Henry Rapoport accepted a position as professor of organic chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. There Sonya Rapoport studied with Erle Loran, receiving her master's degree in art practice in 1949. The Berkeley art practice curriculum at that time was heavily influenced by the aesthetic philosophy of Hans Hofmann, although the school produced artists as divergent in their practices as, Rapoport, Jay DeFeo and Sam Francis.
Artistic evolution.
Rapoport's work in the late 1940s explored the human figure in abstracted form. In the 1950s her painting practice shifted, displaying Abstract expressionist influences while abandoning figuration. While developing her ABEX style, she experimented in watercolors. These joint practices culminated in two solo exhibitions; one at the East West Gallery in San Francisco in 1958, and the other at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in 1963. In the mid-1960s, inspired by reading her husband's scientific journals, she began to assemble different canvases into unified works. In these artworks, she incorporated scientific illustrations, graphic forms, and three-dimensional abstract expressionist constructions. These canvases were juxtaposed according to Rapoport's personal aesthetic. About these works, Dean Wallace wrote, "Sonya Rapoport now tacking together canvases of different expressionist tendencies into a single unit; a work like "Psyche Trio" gives a strange almost schizophrenic feeling. Odd that no one has thought of using this device before.
In the late 1960s, Rapoport helped to found the New York "Pattern painting" movement which she defined as, "buying kinky fabrics and painting out shapes."
1970s.
The 1970s saw a sea change in Rapoport's artistic vision. In 1971 she purchased an antique architect's desk, inside of which she discovered a series of geological survey charts on linen paper from 1905. She used these charts as a background for her "pictorial language of shapes". This language consisted of shapes that represented gender symbols, for instance the uterus, a mandarin orange (fetus), cue holder (udders), fleur-de-lis (fetus), the Moon, etc. and which she collected in a "Pandora's Box". These symbols were used again and again in Rapoport's work during this period.
In 1976, after concentrating for many years on painting and drawing, Rapoport turned her attention to electronic media, with the focus of her work oriented towards interdisciplinary and cultural studies. Computer printouts took the place of the "Survey Charts". In 1977 she exhibited mixed-media works on computer printouts at the Union Gallery at San Jose State University. In these years Rapoport's artworks focused on the representation of overlap between language, symbols, stories from the newspaper, the Bible, and cultural anthropology. She worked with C. Michael Lederer at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, on a project entitled "The Table of Isotopes" in 1977 which dealt with the transformation of Cobalt and Mercury into Gold. Working with the anthropologist Dorothy Washburn in 1978 Rapoport completed "A Shoe-In" held at Berkeley Computer Systems; "Shoe-Field at Media Gallery in San Francisco, "Interaction: Art and Science" at the Truman Gallery in New York, and "Aesthetic Response" at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.
1980s.
From 1979 to 1984 Rapoport worked on her largest project to date, entitled "Objects On My Dresser". This project unfolded in eleven successive phases. Rapoport began by making personal, visually based, free-associative connections in which images of the twenty-nine objects on her dresser were correlated with twenty-nine other random images. Her associations varied from formal to cultural to psychological. Later, she developed interactive installations and magazine polls which required that each of the fifty-eight objects be grouped into one of six themes: (Hand, Chest, Eye, Masking, Threading, and Moving) by people working in three respective fields: artists, scientists, and attorneys. Rapoport plotted the subsequent data to find that the three separate groups made significantly different choices when they categorized the visual objects into the six themes. Lawyers tended to classify the objects similarly to their peers, choosing the same categories for similar objects, while the artists and scientists both displayed broader associative connections when placing the objects into categories.
In 1983 she created a large-scale interactive installation entitled "Biorhythm: How Do You Feel?" at WORKS gallery in San Jose. In this work, Rapoport connected participants to bio-feedback equipment, and asked them to relate their feelings on that particular day. Participants described their emotions both in words and by creating hand gestures that expressed those feelings. Participants then compared their self-assessments with the biofeedback readings.
Rapoport then evaluated this information and created an installation as part of the 1984 show "SF/SF San Francisco/ Science Fiction" at the Clocktower in New York.
Four years later, in a 1987 interactive installation at the Kala Institute entitled "Digital Mudrā" Rapoport returned to the data acquired from "Biorhythm: How Do You Feel?". She associated each participant's gesture with one of 52 hand gestures known as Mudrās. In doing so, Rapoport suggested the cross-cultural correlations of hand gestures and their trans-cultural meanings. Mudrās and their word meanings were juxtaposed within a western context and transcribed onto a computer printout and also, into a Kathakali dance. Rapoport discovered that the words people chose to describe their gestures in western culture, and the words given to the gestures in the Mudrā vocabulary were surprisingly similar. Finally, Rapoport created a slide presentation showing current political leaders making similar gestures having similar verbal contexts.
In 1988 she received a grant from the California Arts Council for the production of "Digital Mudrā" online via Carl Loeffler and Fred Truck's Art Com Electronic Network (ACEN). In 1989, a simplified version of "Digital Mudrā" was uploaded to the Internet as a web-based interactive artwork.
1990s.
"The Animated Soul: Gateway to Your Ka" was a site-specific interactive installation exhibited at the Ghia Gallery, a casket showroom in South San Francisco in 1991, the Takada Gallery in San Francisco, and the Kuopio Museum in Finland, in 1992. "The Animated Soul", in book format, traveled from 1992-1993 throughout the United States under an NEA grant. In this show, set in a tomb environment, viewer-participants interacted with a HyperCard computer program which prompted them to make a series of choices represented by icons. By going through this process, users reenacted the ritual sequence laid out in the Egyptian Book of the Dead in order to discover their double, who in turn would lead them to everlasting life.
In 1993 Sonya Rapoport produced "Sexual Jealousy: The Shadow of Love" as an interactive installation at the Fourth International Symposium on Electronic Art in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this participatory artwork she combined a Gamelan-inspired algorithmic multi-channel musical composition by Michael McNabb, with images from Aubrey Beardsley, Indonesian shadow puppets, and Jungian mythological symbols in a computer assisted interactive installation wherein participants explored their feelings of sexual jealousy and methods of coming to terms with these feelings. Rapoport designed a "Self-help" HyperCard software package in which the user became a protagonist in a shadow play. The user's choices generated lessons in coping, using clips from the soap opera, "The Young and the Restless". The personal emotional subjective states of individual users were linked to symbolic psychological representations. These in turn became the components of a narrative of self-discovery and revelation which subsequently controlled the generation of music.
From 1993 to 1996 Rapoport produced, in several phases, "The Transgenic Bagel", an interactive computer-assisted artwork, with a gene splicing theme. Participants were invited to gamble for the "splice of life" in the "Bagel Casino". Traits were extracted from mythological animals residing in Noah's "Virtual Ark". The "winning" trait gene was processed and injected into a section of a bagel (bagel fragment DNA). Participants could accept the gene by eating the recombinant transgenic bagel, or they could trade the trait.
1995 saw the production of "Smell Your Destiny", another parodic interactive web art project much in the same vein as "The Transgenic Bagel". In this artwork, Rapoport posited that traits historically considered undesirable are now considered more desirable. For example, aggressiveness and competitiveness were once considered negative traits when displayed by women, but now such traits are seen as a key to success in the corporate environment. Rapoport proposed that these new values and traits might be administered to a population by means of aromatherapy. She introduced the idea that pharmaceutical pills that carried specific favorable traits could be fed to fish living near or within a given society. After consuming the pills, the fish would give off a "stink" that would permeate the air and be inhaled by the inhabitants of the surrounding community, thus transmitting the desired traits / societal values to its citizens. This process was historically specific, in that pills fed to fish in the Qumran region in 150 BCE would have been different than those fed to fish today. This piece displayed Rapoport's characteristic love of word play...for instance, the names of the pills given to the fish were all puns of common over-the-counter products, e.g. "Anvil" (for Advil), All-to-rest (for Allerest), Chums (for Tums), My-Thrill (for NyQuil), Contract (for Contac), No-mor-fussin (for Robitussin), and Re-lax (for Ex-Lax), etc. 
From 1996 onward, Rapoport created artworks specifically as websites in which she exhibited an interest in liberal feminist issues. In 1996 she created "Brutal Myths" with collaborator Marie-Jose Sat. "Brutal Myths" was inspired by the sadistic male fantasies about women as found in the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches), a manual for witch-hunting written by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger in the 15th century. Because women were traditionally the lay healers of their societies and used ancient herbs in their medicinal practices, Rapoport used representations of herbs as the metaphoric interface of the web artwork. The first section of "Brutal Myths" describes the "evil" herbs that contaminated the minds of men and made them believe in the dictums laid forth in the Malleus Malificarum. In the second section, the participant "plants" a "blissful" herbal garden of “blessed” herbs. By participating in interactive rituals with the herbs the viewer destroys the prejudicial myths about women and assuages the fears of the men.
"Make Me A Man" (1997) marked a change in Rapoport's voice as an artist wherein she adopted the theoretical standpoint of a man, a voice which she carried through works of the next few years. The artwork reflected on what Rapoport saw as "the stereotype of modern manhood" and reflected on the way that stereotype has been sustained by cultures as diverse as those of Western Europe and the New Guinea Highlands. Both of these cultures acknowledge the superiority of the physiological woman, said to be born with all the vital organs and fluids necessary for giving birth and nurturing an infant. This is contrasted to men who must be molded by the society to conform to an "Ideal" masculinity. Both cultures have a similar gender dogma. Comparative examples of how tribal or technological societies achieve their objective of "growing a man" provide the structure of the work.
"Arbor Erecta: A Botanical Concept For Masculinity" (1998) continued Rapoport's exploration of narrative from the male perspective. This artwork centered around the ethos of the 159 CE. Greek physician Galen who declared "God created plants as a provision for the health of human beings, and left a sign on them – some feature of their shape, color, habitat or behavior–for human beings to decipher." For example, Galen pointed to a plant shaped like an ear that was used as a cure for ear-aches. The artwork fancifully interweaves a news story about "James" (a transsexual person who underwent surgery to change from female to male) with representations of the New Guinea initiation rite of "tree bonding". In the artwork, as James grows from his female body into that of a male, he re-enacts certain New Guinean tribal rituals that purported to purge the female pollutants acquired from the mother from the body of the initiated man.
In 1998-99, strongly influenced by the book "Unheroic Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the Jewish Man" by Daniel Boyarin, Rapoport created "Make Me A Jewish Man: An Alternative Masculinity", which she described as exploring the paradox of rabbinic masculinity. In this, the rabbinic male seeks to usurp for himself the female's characteristics, while at the same time, coupling these acquired feminine aspects with his dominant role as a male. This practice is what leads to the marginalization and exclusion of women. Although appropriations of "femaleness" are necessary in the production of the Jewish male "Ideal", strong gender biases are associated with both the blood of circumcision (which is associated with power) and the blood of childbirth (associated with impurity). Rapoport's project addressed the question of a reversal of female penis envy, that is, how do men cope with the envy of birthing and nurturing? Her main goal was to provide an explanation for male "coping mechanisms" as related to male appropriations of "femaleness," under Talmudic Law in the year 400 CE. A secondary theme was the developing metaphor of the morphology of the Olive Tree for which the Lord named Israel. During interactive interruptions in the narrative, Olive Oyl, wife of macho Popeye, provided the feminist voice which objected to the gender imbalance of the material. For her research on the cultivation of olives, Rapoport used material from her daughter Hava Rapoport's chapter in the book "El Cultivo del Olivo".
2000s.
This work was followed by "Redeeming the Gene, Molding the Golem, Folding the Protein" in 2002. Returning to the feminist voice Rapoport created a mythic parody designed to be viewed on the Internet. In it, she wanted to challenge the current genetic engineering technology by creating an artificial anthropoid, the Golem, according to the ancient Hebraic ritual directions given in the Kabbalah. In the story, Lilith and Eve, maligned sources of female evil for many years reinvented themselves by creating an ethical gene that they used to mold the Golem. The "Kabbalah gene", displaced the "artist's gene" that Eduardo Kac invented in his artwork, "Genesis."
In 2004, Rapoport produced "Kabbalah/Kabul: Sending Emanations to the Aliens". This work, another interactive web artwork concerned with the transmission of traits, opened with an image of a US helicopter carrying the Kabbalah’s major icon, the Tree of Life, whose branches are marked with altruistic "emanations". This time, Rapoport proposed that encoded altruistic traits could be transmitted across interstellar space by radio or laser signals. When the participant selects an emanation by clicking on its icon, an associated image of a stem cell within a cell cluster differentiates (lights up and changes into) a body part. The selected cell is eventually enhanced with a DNA altruistic trait in preparation for delivery to the extraterrestrials. Participants absorb the altruism(s) into their psyches as the messages are catapulted from earth into outer space. "Kabbalah/Kabul" endeavors to integrate the infinite outer universe with the altruistic universe that resides within each person on Earth.
"(in)AUTHENTIC: Woman, War, Jew" (2007) was created as a "Memory Theatre" in collaboration with Robert Edgar. The work exists as an interactive website that builds itself while the viewer watches. Memory Theatres were first formulated in the 16th century by Giulio Camillo as a way to sense the structure of the cosmos through painting, text and architecture. in the artwork, Rapoport reflects upon her own cosmos of gender, race, science, and mythology in the artwork. Images used include those of various military tanks, African hairstyles mitochondria and Jungian mythological images. These were accompanied by audio recordings consisting of an imaginary contentious dialogue between Luce Irigaray, Sigmund Freud and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the "play" these voices trigger an invasion of robotic tank warfare into the cosmology of Rapoport’s persona. The concept of theatre in this work takes on two meanings: in once sense it refers to a theatre of memory; in another sense it refers to a theatre of war. Within these co-extensive theatres, an army tank, a phallic metaphor, moves between what Rapoport considers authentic and what is inauthentic as found in the aggressive environments of gender, war and religion.
A retrospective exhibition of Rapoport's work, "Sonya Rapoport: Pairings and Polarities" was held at the Kala Institute from 4 March to 9 April 2011. Another retrospective of her work is planned for the Mills College Art Museum in January 2012.

HOTAIR

HOTAIR (for HOX antisense intergenic RNA) is a human gene located on chromosome 12. It is the first example of an RNA expressed on one chromosome that has been found to influence transcription on another chromosome.
Gene and transcribed RNA product.
The HOTAIR gene contains 6,232 bp and encodes 2.2 kb long noncoding RNA molecule, which controls gene expression. Its source DNA is located within a HOXC gene cluster. It is shuttled from chromosome 12 to chromosome 2 by the Suz-Twelve protein.
Function.
The 5' end of HOTAIR interacts with a Polycomb-group protein Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and as a result regulates chromatin state. It is required for gene-silencing of the HOXD locus by PRC2. The 3' end of HOTAIR interacts with the histone demethylase LSD1.
It is an important factor in the epigenetic differentiation of skin over the surface of the body. Skin from various anatomical positions is distinct, e.g. the skin of the eyelid differs markedly from that on the sole of the foot.
Clinical significance.
HOTAIR is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancers. High levels of expression in primary breast tumours are a significant predictor of subsequent metastasis and death. It is also involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

ELAM 10 Rafael Ferro Macias

ELAM 10: Rafael Ferro Macias is a faculty of the Escuela Latinamericana de Medicina (known as the Latin American School of Medicine) located in Sandino, in the province of Pinar del Río, Cuba. The faculty comprises approximately 300 students from 18 countries including Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Nauru, The Solomon Islands, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. All of these countries are in or close to the Caribbean except The Solomon Islands, Nauru and Vanuatu, which are all located in the Pacific. Also the students of this school are mostly from anglophone countries with the exception of Belize (which shares borders with Mexico and Guatemala) and Ecuador where Spanish is spoken natively, and Haiti where French and French Creole are the dominant languages.
The school is currently under the jurisdiction of two leaders: Irma Martinez Silva, the Directora of the premedical programme and Nadia Macias Hernandez, the Decana of the medical programme
Grouping system.
The school currently comprises nine different groups and four advances. Each advance is defined by the level of Spanish known upon entry of the school.
The first advance is composed of group seven and contains 34 students from Belize, Ecuador, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia and Suriname. This group is considered to speak the most fluent Spanish in the school although a few grammatical errors still exist among those who had very little exposure to Spanish in their respective countries. Also this group is known to have exposure to variants of Spanish spoken by Cubans, Nicaraguans, Bolivians, Ecuadorians, Argentinians and other countries. This group has recently matriculated into the school of medicine.
The second advance is composed of groups one to six and contains students from Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Nauru, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Suriname. This group is considered to speak a fair amount of Spanish that allows them to communicate with most persons within the community and to communicate fluently enough with their respective teachers. These students are a part of the premedical school.
The third advance is composed of group eight and contains students from Haiti and The Solomon Islands. The students of this group arrived in the month of March 2008 with little or almost no knowledge of Spanish. This group speaks Spanish sufficiently enough to communicate and have conversation with other Spanish speakers but they do not possess a large dominion over the language. These students are a part of the premedical school
The fourth advance is the newest advance of the school and contains students from The Bahamas, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu. These students arrived in late August and September 2008 and will begin classes shortly in the premedical school.
Languages.
Because of the variety of countries present in this school, there are many languages spoken. Among those are: English, Dutch, French, Spanish, Javanese, Hindi and various creoles such as Bajan, Jamaican Creole, Belizean Creole, French Creole, Guyanese Creole, Trinidadian Creole, Pidgin and Sranan Tongo (A creole language spoken in Suriname). There is also a small presence of Maroon languages spoken in Suriname such as Ndyuka.
Culture and lifestyle.
The students of ELAM10 have somewhat developed a culture of their own, which includes a rich mixture of cultures worldwide with a Caribbean base.
Living conditions.
The boarding house of the school, which is annexed to the actual school by a bridge of sorts, consists of 28 available dormitories, each containing 8 bunk beds and thus housing 16 persons in each room. The school, therefore has enough capacity high enough for 448 students. This value excludes 4 rooms which are currently used by the ancillary staff of the school and also a separate section reserved for teachers.
These rooms are divided into sections. The males dormitory has sections V1 to V4 and the females dormitory has sections from H2 to H4. Each section contains 4 rooms and a large communal bathroom which has seven toilets, six shower stalls, a large wash sink with six taps and a smaller wash sink with three taps.
There are also several recreational areas on the campus. These include a tranquil, nicely shaded park in the front of the school with large poinciana trees used as an area for study and also for worship by various students. There are several sporting areas as well. These include 2 basketball courts, a volleyball court, and a sand area used to practice various sports such as beach football, beach volleyball and also for traditional games played by the students. There is also a driveway of approximately 120 metres used for athletic activity.
There are also several useful facilities on the campus such as a washroom, a general dining room and a nurses bay. Also, there are intranet facilities with highly restricted internet in each classroom where students have the opportunity to communicate with family and persons from other schools using email addresses given to them by the school.

Mountain Dale, New York

Mountaindale is a hamlet in the town of Fallsburg in Sullivan County, New York, United States, situated at an altitude of .
Mountaindale changed drastically in character from a rural farming hamlet, beginning with the arrival of the New York, Ontario & Western Railroad, and the name change of the local post office, in December 1880, from Sandburg(h) to Mountain Dale. Around that time a number of farmhouses that were more hotels than farms opened, and beginning in 1899 the ethnic character of the area began to change from predominantly gentile to predominantly Jewish.
By the time of the crash of 1929, several Jewish welfare organizations were engaged in resettling Jewish families whose breadwinners were unable, due to health reasons, to make a living in the New York City sweatshops, onto subsistence farms in the Mountaindale area. While good-hearted this effort may have been, in some cases it simply replaced urban poverty with an even more extreme form of rural poverty.
Helen Brown, principal of Mountaindale High School in 1931, told stories of children being sewn into their long underwear in October to be cut out in April, and one particularly poignant story of a young man who played on Mountaindale High School's basketball team who broke a leg going up for a rebound when her husband had taken them to New York City to scrimmage the Columbia freshmen. The broken leg simply did not heal. Ultimately, it was discovered that the young man's diet at home did not contain any of the necessary nutrients—in fact, it consisted of little more than flour and water. Discovering that the poverty in the homes of most of the basketball players was equally dire, they undertook the practice of feeding the basketball team each Friday evening at their home in Liberty.
The hamlet is also famous for the "Yeshiva Zichron Mayir of Mountaindale", a school founded by Rabbi Yehuda Davis in 1960 in Brooklyn, NY. The school was moved to Mountaindale in 1974, and passed down to Rabbi Rothenberg, who died in early 2013.
Mountaindale came within hours of hosting Bach to Rock Festival a concert intended to rival Woodstock in both scope and size. For the month of August in 1970 the hamlet played host to over 50,000 hippies until a court order halted the concert less than one day before it was to open.
The Hebrew Congregation of Mountaindale Synagogue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Alliance for Open Society International

Alliance for Open Society International, Inc. (AOSI) is a U.S. public charity organized in 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Operations.
AOSI promotes the values of open, democratic societies globally. AOSI coordinates, administers, and advises national and regional programs in Central Asia and elsewhere on a range of public health, education, and general civil society issues. It also educates the public about societies' attempts to become democratic market economies after totalitarian or authoritarian rule.
In the United States it works with the U.S. federal government on charitable projects that address challenges facing urban communities and centers. AOSI makes and receives grants in addition to cooperating with other charitable organizations to achieve these goals.
Leadership.
Chris Stone serves as Chair and President, Maija Arbolino serves as Member and Treasurer, and A. Nicole Campbell serves as Member and Secretary of AOSI.
Lawsuit.
In September 2005, AOSI sued the United States Agency for International Development and other U.S. Government agencies in response to the government extending an anti-prostitution pledge that was a component of HIV/AIDS policy during the George W. Bush administration to cover non-profit organizations based in the United States. The pledge required recipients of funding under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act to state that they had a policy opposing prostitution and prohibited them from engaging in speech or activity the government deemed inconsistent with an anti-prostitution policy. The requirement covered recipient organizations as a whole, and therefore restricted speech or activity that took place outside the government-funded program and was paid for with entirely private funds.
As described by the online magazine "Medical News Today":
At issue in the case is a requirement that public health groups receiving U.S. funds pledge their "opposition to prostitution" in order to continue their life-saving HIV prevention work. Under this "pledge requirement," recipients of U.S. funds are forced to censor even their privately funded speech regarding the most effective ways to engage high-risk groups in HIV prevention.
Just prior to this case, the non-profit organization DKT International had brought a similar lawsuit, prevailing in District Court but losing on appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The February 2007 ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution through affiliate organizations that did not receive federal funding.
With the backing of the American Civil Liberties Union, AOSI sued the United States Agency for International Development, the financial backers of its Central Asian drug rehabilitation programs. AOSI's initial co-plaintiffs were the Open Society Institute and Pathfinder International. They were joined later in the litigation by InterAction and the Global Health Council. Lawyers from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law represented the plaintiffs.
In May 2006, Judge Victor Marrero, a federal judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, issued a preliminary injunction barring the government from requiring AOSI and Pathfinder International to sign the anti-prostitution pledge. The government appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. During the oral argument in the case, the government stated that it intended to issue regulations that would allow legally and physically separate affiliates of recipient organizations to engage in the prohibited speech.
The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Court of Appeals returned the case for trial to the District Court for reconsideration in light of the new guidelines but left the injunction in place.
In August 2008, the district court held that the new guidelines did not cure the constitutional problems with the requirement. The government appealed again to the Second Circuit. While the appeal was pending, the government again revised the affiliate guidelines. In July 2011, the Second Circuit held that the requirement was unconstitutional and that the new affiliate guidelines did not cure the violation. The Supreme Court granted review in January 2013.
In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in "Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc." that the requirement was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court explained that the requirement would "plainly violate the First Amendment" if “enacted as a direct regulation of speech,” and that the question in the case was whether the government could “nonetheless impose that requirement as a condition on the receipt of federal funds.” The Court noted that it had previously struck down “conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself.” The Court concluded that the requirement was just such a condition because it “compel as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program,” and therefore that the requirement violated the First Amendment. The decision is significant for its holdings on the scope of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and it is likely to have continuing importance for evaluating the constitutionality of government attempts to restrict speech by recipients of government funding.

Morane-Saulnier Vanneau

__NOTOC__
The Morane-Saulnier Vanneau (en: plover) is a two-seat basic trainer built in France by Morane-Saulnier and ordered by the French Air Force.
Development.
Designed in Vichy France the MS.470 prototype first flew on 22 December 1944, successful testing led to an order from the French Air Force of a revised variant the MS.472. The Vanneau was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a pilot and student in tandem under a long glazed canopy. It had a retractable tailwheel landing gear and the prototype was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12X inline engine. The production MS.472 was powered by a Gnome-Rhône 14M-05 14-cylinder radial engine and first flew on 12 December 1945, with deliveries to the French Air Force starting in December 1946. From December 1947 the French Navy received 70 of the MS.474 variant modified for carrier operations. A re-engined version the MS.475 was produced from 1950 which had minor differences but was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 V-12 engine. One MS.475 was modified as the MS.476 with an increase in wing surface area and another MS.475 was fitted with a Renault 12S-02 engine as the MS.477 in 1950. A proposed variant was the MS.478 which was to be fitted with an Isotta Fraschini Delta engine but was not built. One MS.472 was re-engined with a SNECMA 14X-04 radial engine in 1952 but development was later stopped. The Vanneau remained in service with the French Air Force and Navy into the late 1960s.

House of Charm

The House of Charm is a historic museum building in Balboa Park, San Diego. It was built for the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition, and like most buildings from that Exposition it features Mission Revival Style architecture. It acquired its current name, "House of Charm", during the park's second Exposition held in 1935-36. It now houses the San Diego Art Institute and the Mingei International Museum as well as rehearsal space for the Old Globe Theatre. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Panama-California Exposition, 1915-1916.
San Diego staged the Panama-California Exposition in 1915 to celebrate the completion of the Panama Canal and to call attention to the fact that San Diego would be the first American port of call north of the Panama Canal on the Pacific coast. In 1910 San Diego had a population of 39,578, San Diego County 61,665, Los Angeles 319,198, and San Francisco 416,912. San Diego's scant population made it the smallest city ever to attempt holding an international exposition. However, the Exposition was a huge success and was extended for a second year.
The building now known as the House of Charm was originally named the Mining Building, intended to showcase the mineral wealth and abundance of the region of San Diego. Another temporary name was the "Arts and Crafts Building," but by the time the fair opened in 1915 the building was called the "Indian Arts Building." When the fair was extended to 1916, the exhibits changed and the building was once again renamed, this time to the "Russia and Brazil Building." From 1917 to 1922 it was known as the "Science of Man Building" and housed specimens, casts, statues, and photographs illustrating the development of the human species. It was later used for refreshment stands and flower shows.
Bertram Goodhue, master architect of the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition, had urged that the temporary buildings on Balboa Park's main avenue, El Prado, be torn down. However, San Diego's citizens scorned this advice. With the assistance of money from the federal government, they patched up the plaster palaces in 1922 and 1933. This meant that the most of the original buildings were available for re-use in the second exposition in 1935.
California Pacific International Exposition: 1935-1936.
The California-Pacific International Exposition used many of the Mission Revival Style buildings remaining from the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition, including the Science of Man Building. During the 1935-36 exhibition the building was renamed the House of Charm, by which name it is still known today. During 1935 it housed commercial concessions devoted to women's clothing, jewelry, hosiery, shoes, cosmetics and perfumes, as well as a drug store and refreshment stand. In 1936 the name was changed again to Palace of International Arts, featuring gems and artifacts from all over the world, some for sale and some for exhibit.
Later use.
Although there were ongoing doubts about the soundness of the building, which was not intended to be a permanent structure, it continued to be used during the 1940s and 1950s. Tenants included the Model Railroad Museum, the San Diego Hall of Champions, and the San Diego Men's Art Club (forerunner of the San Diego Art Institute). In 1978 the building was condemned as unsafe and was temporarily evacuated, but the San Diego Art Institute moved back in after sprinklers were installed. During the 1980s various tenants competed for use of the building, but none could afford the necessary renovations. Finally in 1989 the city of San Diego decided to tear down and rebuild the House of Charm, along with the House of Hospitality which was in similar disrepair. The recreated House of Charm building was reopened on September 21, 1996, with external features carefully duplicating the original highly ornamented exterior. The building now houses the San Diego Art Institute, the Mingei International Museum, and rehearsal space for the Old Globe Theatre.
Museum of the Living Artist (MoLA).
The San Diego Art Institute's (SDAI) Museum of the Living Artist (MoLA) has a gallery in the House of Charm, featuring works by San Diego artists. A new exhibit opens every four to six weeks. Solo artist exhibitions are also featured. With more than 30 shows a year, SDAI aims to be a supportive center for local emerging artists. The Institute also offers many outreach and educational programs. The David Fleet Young Artists' Gallery showcases art done by students at regional elementary, middle and high schools, while the Outreach through Exhibition Series calls upon artists to address community issues in their art.
Mingei International Museum.
Mingei International Museum reveals the beauty of use in folk art, craft and design from all eras and cultures of the world. The word mingei, meaning 'art of the people,' was coined by the Japanese scholar Sōetsu Yanagi by combining the Japanese words for all people ("min") and art ("gei"). Yanagi's teachings awakened people to the essential need to make and use objects that are unfragmented expressions of head, heart and hands. Established in 1978, Mingei International Museum collects, conserves and exhibits these arts of daily use - by anonymous craftsmen of ancient times, from traditional cultures of past and present and by historical and contemporary designers.

Princess Helena Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg

Princess Helena Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (; 1 June 1888 - 30 June 1962) was the third eldest daughter of Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and his wife Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. She was a princess of Denmark through her marriage within the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg to Prince Harald of Denmark. Princess Helena was a Nazi sympathiser during World War II and was after the war exiled from Denmark.
Early life.
Princess Helena was born 1 June 1888 at Grünholz Manor in Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia as the third eldest daughter of Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his wife Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.
Princess Helena's father was the eldest son of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and a nephew of Christian IX of Denmark. Three years before the birth of Princess Helena, he had succeeded to the headship of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and the title of duke upon the death of his father in 1885.
Marriages and issue.
After their marriage, Prince Harald and Princess Helena lived at the Jægersborghus country house north of Copenhagen which Prince Harald had purchased in 1907. Here their five children were born between 1910 and 1923.
Later life.
Princess Helena became very unpopular during World War II because of her sympathy for the German occupation and the Nazi party after the German occupation of Denmark in 1940. The Danish resistance movement stated that Princess Helena was the only member of the Danish royal house to have betrayed Denmark: she received and entertained Germans in her home, attended parties hosted by the Germans at Gesandtskab and had been introduced to Danish nazists by Ebba Lerche. Because of this, she was reportedly not on speaking terms with her sons.
Her employee, Paul Dall, responsible for the setting of her table, was a contact of the German Abwehr in Copenhagen, and was after the war judged guilty as a spy.
In 18 January 1942 she participated in the memorial service for the SS:man C.E. von Schalburg, who had died on the Russian front, a service at which the monarch refused to attend. In 1942, she made efforts to convince Prince Knud of Denmark to persuade the monarch to allow Nazi members in to the Danish government.
Princess Helena is not considered to have been a regular German agent, but rather an informer and a contact on informal basis.
After the war, owing to Princess Helena being a member of the Royal house, she was not brought to trial, as any punishment was at the discretion of the King. She was instead exiled from Denmark on 30 May 1945 and placed under house arrest at the Glücksburg Castle in Germany.
She was allowed to return to Denmark in 1947, when Prince Harald fell gravely ill. She stayed with her spouse until his death two years later.
Prince Harald died on 30 March 1949 in Copenhagen. Princess Helena survived her husband by 13 years and died on 30 June 1962 in Hellerup, Denmark. She was buried at Roskilde Cathedral.
Issue.
Helena and Harald had five children:
Ancestry.
Descent from Christopher II of Denmark.
She was a direct descendant of Christopher II of Denmark and brought the line of his illegitimate son Erik Christoffersen Løvenbalk back into the Danish royal line. The current reigning Danish royal family only descend from Christopher II's sister Richeza.

Naomi Clark

Naomi Clark played by AnnaLynne McCord, is a fictional character from the CW primetime drama "90210", the fourth series of the "Beverly Hills, 90210" franchise. The character was created by Rob Thomas, Gabe Sachs, and Jeff Judah, with later developments by Rebecca Sinclair, and occasional input from McCord.
During early stages of production, Naomi was largely described as a privileged and popular teenager. Prior to the series' premiere, Sachs and Judah would further develop Naomi into an antiheroine with a number of flaws, virtues, and familial issues. In the second season, Sinclair, the new show-runner, maintained the previous developments but presented a more comedic take on the character. McCord has expressed fondness for the multi-faceted nature of the role, citing it as a factor in her decision to accept the part.
Often regarded as the show's central figure, Naomi has received critical acclaim from the "Los Angeles Times", "Entertainment Weekly", "People" magazine, and other media outlets. Reviews have generally praised the casting of the actress and the complexity of the role. Conversely, Naomi has also been a recipient of criticism, particularly during the second season. For her work in the role, McCord was nominated for a Teen Choice Award in 2009, and won a Breakthrough of the Year Award in 2010.
Season 1.
Creation.
Naomi Clark was initially developed by the series' original show-runner, Rob Thomas, who was succeeded by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah prior to the premiere. Early press releases described the character as a privileged, attractive, and popular teenager, prompting the media to draw comparisons to Kelly Taylor of "Beverly Hills, 90210", the first series of the franchise which launched "90210". As production of the spin-off began, the part would become more defined, with actress AnnaLynne McCord, who received the role, labeling Naomi an intelligent girl who possessed both manipulative and sensitive sides. She further described the character as "kind of a chameleon", stating that "she'll be someone with the principal and then someone else with her mother and then someone else with her friend."
Sachs also described Naomi as a layered character whose nature would be explored as the series progressed. With regard to playing such roles, McCord stated, "I tend to reach out to people like Clark because I can see they are putting on a facade and are not as bad as they seem. They will eventually let their guard down and become nice people." The actress opted not to review the original series before beginning her role in the spin-off, expressing a desire for Naomi to have her own identity.
Prior to being cast in "90210", McCord had begun building a reputation for playing vixens and antiheroines, notably via the role of Eden Lord in the FX series "Nip/Tuck". After declining two offers to play Naomi, she eventually accepted in April 2008, believing that her exposure on the show would help to benefit the charities she was involved in. McCord was able to offer the creators her input on the character following her casting. Additionally, she was the second performer and the first actress to be cast.
Introduction.
Naomi is introduced as a rich girl who attends West Beverly Hills High. Her first on-screen birthday coincides with the birth of the series, during which several aspects of the character's personality are revealed. Self-esteem is shown to be one of Naomi's biggest virtues and vices early on. When she is assigned to work with new student Annie Wilson (Shenae Grimes), she initially appears snobbish and withdrawn. Afterward, she unveils a more pleasant demeanor as the two spend time together, but also reveals an opportunistic side by attempting to plagiarize one of Annie's papers. Upon being caught, however, she becomes offended when others express doubts about her ability, and seeks to prove that she can complete the work herself.
Naomi is gradually shown to have a friendly nature during her introduction, inviting Annie to her birthday party when asked to, while fidelity is revealed to be of importance to her as well. When her personal life is explored, she is shown to value her longtime boyfriend Ethan Ward (Dustin Milligan). However, her birthday party is disrupted by the news that Ethan has been unfaithful to her.
Social power is also said to be a priority of Naomi's in early episodes, along with social prominence. According to Erin Silver (Jessica Stroup), who is commonly called by her surname, the two were best friends until an Naomi told various people that Silver's father had cheated on her mother with a much younger woman.
Progression.
Several of the foundations laid in the opening episodes are built upon as the series progresses. In the third episode, Naomi is traumatized by the discovery that her father is having an affair. In episode four, she is shown to maintain a close relationship with Ethan, despite their break-up, turning to him for comfort. She again reveals a friendly side when she pacifies Ethan's autistic brother. Later, she is presented with an opportunity to confront her father's mistress, and boldly does so. She and Erin Silver also take steps toward reconciliation. Afterward, Naomi schemes to save her parents' marriage, though her efforts are ultimately in vain. When her friend Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) encounters problems due to her drug habit, Naomi's good will is displayed again, as she eventually steps in and attempts to intervene. In the eighth episode, her intelligence is further hinted at when it is revealed that Naomi speaks Spanish.
Though their personalities differ at times, several of Naomi's issues parallel those of Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) from the original series. Early on in the show, she values her 'in-crowd' status and experiences repeated friction with a friend over a boy (as Kelly did). When Annie begins bonding with Ethan, Naomi reveals that the situation is likely to interfere with their friendship. Annie's eventual dismissal of this statement leads to a temporary rift between the girls. Also like Kelly, Naomi endures the experience of a family torn apart by adultery, and is later faced with the matter of an absent parent, as her mother departs town unexpectedly. After her parents have officially split, Naomi seeks temporary refuge in a hotel.
Later, Naomi dates a West Beverly student named Liam Court (Matt Lanter). At Naomi's after-prom party, Jen (Sara Foster), her sister, seduces Liam to get back at Naomi for defying her and holding the event at their house. Naomi catches the aftermath (sans Jen) and finds Annie's wrap with Liam, causing her to publicly accuse Annie of sleeping with him. She is last shown being comforted by Jen while police sirens are heard due to Annie reporting the underage drinking.
Season 2.
Impact.
During the initial development of "90210", the character Annie Wilson was conceived as the central role of the series. As the first season progressed, however, AnnaLynne McCord gained recognition as the show's breakout performer in the role of Naomi. Media outlets began referring to McCord as the series' lead throughout Seasons 1 and 2; the actress was also nominated for a Teen Choice Award in the category of "Breakout Star Female" in 2009. Rebecca Sinclair, the series' show-runner, had also become impressed with Naomi's portrayal. Though McCord's cast billing would remain the same in the second season, Naomi Clark was placed "front and center", largely becoming the show's central character.
Several of the series' story lines in Season 2 are shown to have various ties to Naomi, including the deepening of Jen Clark's duplicity, the shaken state of Annie Wilson, and the development of a sensitive side in the character of Liam Court. In addition, Silver and Adrianna, who did not associate often in the first season, are shown to have grown closer in the second through their mutual bonds with Naomi. Shortly after the second season premiered, articles from "Entertainment Weekly" and "MSN" applauded the increased focus on McCord's character. The actress also promoted the series on "Live with Regis and Kelly" and "The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien".
Direction.
At the beginning of Season 2, McCord reported that producers would be taking her character into "more comedic" territory. "I don't really consider myself funny, but they wanted her to go along this route, so I'm learning alongside Naomi how to be funny." The actress also claimed that Naomi would continue to display an "ever-emerging heart," and that "at the end of the day, she's the most loyal friend you’ll have—as long as you don't screw her." With regard to the character's appearance, McCord described Naomi as "beautiful," but requested that her makeup be limited in Season 2, stating that "the girls who are watching the show don’t need to see a girl portraying seventeen caked up in all this makeup."
Story lines.
The second season opens on Naomi completing her final day of summer school, which she'd been forced to attend due to the underage drinking at her party. It is revealed that she, Silver, and Adrianna have formed a friendly trio during the summer. Naomi briefly dates an older man who she later discovers is married, leading her to break up with him. She is still upset at Annie and considers revenge after obtaining naked pictures of her. She hesitates to act at first, but is later encouraged to by Jen, widening the rift between her and Annie. Later, after she escapes some of Jen's influence, Naomi visits California University, and grows close to the dean's son, Richard, along with a boy named Jamie.
Following the death of Silver's mother, Jackie, Naomi provides Erin with comfort. Soon afterward, Naomi learns the truth about Jen's actions on the night of the prom, creating a rift between the two. Naomi then offers Annie her apologies. Annie initially keeps her at a distance, while Liam, after much effort, is eventually given a second chance with Naomi. Later, she begins to encounter awkwardness with Liam. After clashing with Mr. Cannon (Hal Ozsan), a faculty member, Naomi falsely accuses him of sexual harassment while talking with her friends, who unexpectedly urge her to come forward with the experience. As with her attack on Annie, she initially declines to act. However, she eventually does so when Liam faces expulsion for assaulting Cannon. She is later called to testify in front of the school board, which prompts her to reveal the truth. Afterward, Naomi faces new conflicts with her sister Jen, while Liam eventually leaves Naomi upon deciding that their relationship is no longer working. While experiencing trouble with her car one evening, she seeks assistance in school and stumbles upon Mr. Cannon. He kisses Naomi repeatedly as she refuses and pushes him away, but he continues and eventually rapes her.
Season 3.
Direction.
In an interview with E!, McCord revealed what she expected for Naomi after she was attacked at the end of Season 2. "I kinda feel like there will be some downward spiral in a way for Naomi's character, but she's good at covering, so she'll still have that facade." In a later interview with "HollywoodLife.com", she further stated, "For me, it's important to let all teenagers know, and all women know, if you're violated you have to speak up." The actress also expressed a personal investment in the story, having worked with victims of abuse in a real-life anti-trafficking organization.
Story lines.
In the Season 3 premiere, it is revealed that Naomi spent the summer at a motel. She later decides to press charges against Cannon, but becomes discouraged from going through with the process. In the second episode, she gains access to her trust fund upon turning 18. Later, her friends attempt to help prove that Cannon raped her. She and Jen reconcile in the process. Eventually, Naomi and the police obtain new evidence against Cannon. However, Cannon disappears before he can be arrested. She then begins moving forward in her personal life. When she returns to her hotel room after Adrianna's Christmas party, Mr. Cannon is shown waiting for her unnoticed. He later holds both Naomi and Silver captive, though they eventually manage to subdue him and call the police. While recovering from her last encounter with Mr. Cannon, she takes up meditation, leading her to cross paths with a guru who cons her out of a large sum of money. Naomi later retrieves the money with the help of her science partner, Max (Josh Zuckerman). Naomi is shocked to find herself beginning to like Max, and they soon begin a relationship. At the end of the third season, Naomi tells Max that she is pregnant.
Season 4.
The fourth season begins with Naomi breaking up with Max after what she feels is his excessive relief on discovering that her pregnancy was a false positive. Attempting to make a big impression at California University (CU), Naomi buys a large house, coming into conflict with the owner's son Austin Tallridge (Justin Deeley), who had been growing marijuana on the property. Naomi throws a big elaborate beginning of school party for CU students but this backfires when the party is raided by the police and Naomi disposes of Austin's marijuana plants by tossing them on a bonfire, causing CU's star quarterback to later test positive for drug use. The disastrous party causes Naomi to enter CU as the most unpopular girl in school, a situation she attempts to rectify by pledging a popular sorority. Initially things appear to be going well as Naomi is taken under the wing of the sorority President, Holly (Megalyn Echikunwoke). But after performing a series of humiliating hazing rituals, Naomi discovers that Holly never intended to let her into the sorority and that this was all done to humiliate Naomi. Vowing revenge, Naomi buys her way into the only sorority that will have her: one made up of nerds and social rejects, and becomes their president. Naomi has sex with Austin after he agrees to help her new sorority humiliate Holly. However, she later learns that Austin was using her to break up with Holly, whom he had been dating. When Holly invites Max to a campus event to unsettle Naomi, she rekindles her romance with him, but still finds herself attracted to Austin. At a talent show fundraiser for Raj (Manish Dayal), Naomi becomes obsessed with outdoing Austin's new 'girlfriend', who is really his cousin who's staying with him for the week. After surprising a clueless Max during their performance, Max breaks things off with Naomi, saying he can't be the guy who's okay with his girlfriend having feelings for someone else. Naomi and Austin then embark on a relationship. In Project Runway, Naomi is thrilled to compete in CU's fashion design competition, but her excitement quickly dies down when she finds out she's competing against nemesis Holly. The two waste no time in trying to one-up each other, with Naomi donating a large sum of money to the competition's fashion show so that her fashions can be showcased in the most flattering way. When she reveals she'll have the ab-man himself Liam, modeling her designs.
Holly goes behind her back and books him through his modeling agency. But that's not all she steals; the night of the fashion show, Naomi discovers that Holly's ripped off her designs and the two end up in a full-blown fight backstage. Though neither gal wins the competition, Naomi gets an internship offer from a Hollywood event planner, and the two dueling divas decide to call a truce. Holly also wanted the internship with the influential planner, who just happens to be her mother. In O Holly Night, Naomi tries to earn her stripes as an intern, at the expense of her friendship with Holly and relationship with Austin, ultimately. Naomi tries to pull double duty both working and playing at Holly's birthday bash, though she is pretty quickly outed as the person who "stole" the internship at her mom's party planning firm.
In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi is still rocking her party-planning internship under Rachel’s guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly. Austin says Holly snuck in and attacked him right after he came out of the shower but Naomi refuses to listen to him. Naomi has been so hard at work that her boss, Holly’s mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi has been caught in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama Can You Hear Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‘New Naomi’ and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi’s suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi’s new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn’t staying at the hotel she had gone to. The boss blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position in all that transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends.
In Trust, Truth and Traffic, Naomi has embarked on her career as a free lance event planner, and she has even managed to spot her probable new client. Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced with a problem when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa’s party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to get good marks on her project, than him favoring her in any way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.
Season 5.
In the fifth season opener, Max proposes to Naomi after leaving his bride-to-be standing at the altar. They elope and get married. When they return to Naomi's place to celebrate, Alec, Max's business partner tells Naomi that her and Max's relationship is a mistake. He tries multiple times to sabotage their relationship, but ultimately fails. Fed up of always fighting with Alec, Naomi asks Max to choose between her and Alec. While Max chooses her, which forces him to fire Alec from his company, their relationship becomes strained. Max and Naomi search for a replacement to Alec and when she sees the resume of Bryce Woodbridge, she tells Max to meet him as he seems to be the best candidate. However, after she discovers that Bryce is actually a woman, Naomi says she will do the job. After an unsuccessful attempt at the job, she asks Bryce to reconsider their offer. Bryce accepts the position but manages to fire Max, which was set up by Alec. He later admits to Naomi that he is in love with Max, who in the meantime has left for a gamer conference in Iceland. Naomi finds out that he had been hiding at his parents' house. The couple seeks the help of a marriage counselor. Max explains he didn't want Naomi to run his life and the counselor says that Naomi lost herself. The pair later agrees to divorce and Max decides to go back to MIT. Naomi finds her and Annie's half brother, Mark Holland (Charlie Weber), a chef who owns a gourmet food truck. After he doesn't want anything to do with her, Naomi decides to host a band and food truck contest at CU and sabotages it to let Mark win. Mark is initially upset with Naomi but agrees afterwards to open a restaurant with her after Annie talked to him.
Reception.
Acclaim.
In its biographical page on McCord, "Yahoo!" states that via the role of Naomi, the actress "became one of Hollywood’s top young stars-to-watch after the series premiered to more than 5 million viewers worldwide." In a review of the series premiere, Tom Gliatto of "People" magazine stated that, "The standout is AnnaLynne McCord as bad-girl Naomi Clark: She’s very striking physically—almost startling, somewhere between Charlize Theron and Courtney Love—and she conveys a mix of high drama, meanness and little-girl self-pity that’s a lot of fun." Staff members of the "Fort Worth Star-Telegram" found McCord's performance "surprisingly more nuanced" than her previous work as Eden Lord. The article also declared that Naomi appeared to be the most complex of the younger characters early on, labeling her a "popular but vulnerable but snotty but misunderstood but vindictive high-school queen." "Seventeen" magazine called the character "the ultimate queen bee" in 2009. Following the completion of Season 1, McCord appeared on the premiere cover of "Beauty Entertainment" magazine, which made reference to Naomi's "Good Girl, Bad Girl" status.
Shortly after the premiere of Season 2, Tanner Stransky of "Entertainment Weekly" stated that the series "is getting better and better this season as it deliciously morphs into "The AnnaLynne McCord Show"". In a later "EW" review, Jennifer Armstrong labeled Naomi "awesome", and declared McCord "a treasure" in the role.
In an autumn television recap, the magazine proclaimed the series' second season an improvement on the first, and remarked that, "Moving AnnaLynne McCord's immensely entertaining anti-heroine, Naomi, front and center certainly didn't hurt." While noting "90210"'s continuing focus on its younger cast in 2010, "E! Online" stated, "AnnaLynne McCord, we're looking at you". While discussing Jennie Garth of the original series, "HollywoodLife.com" proclaimed McCord "the modern-day leading lady". In the midst of Season 2, the actress was labeled "the star of "90210"" by "Shape" magazine, also appearing on the cover.
In regards to the humorous aspects of the character, Emily Exton of "Entertainment Weekly" stated that McCord had "honed her comedic timing" in the second season. Jethro Nededog expressed similar acclaim in a review for the "Los Angeles Times", in which he commented on a comically driven Naomi, and asked, "Is there anything better than Naomi when she knows what she wants?" Nededog also lauded Naomi's material in the second season finale, citing the character's "movement, activity and depth."
While reviewing the third season, Andy Swift of "HollywoodLife.com" compared McCord to Joan Collins, stating that she "gives every scene 110 percent". "Entertainment Weekly"'s Archana Ram wrote, "I've said it before, and I'll say it again: AnnaLynne McCord is the best part of "90210". And last night, she proved it again by giving us a glimpse of all the colors of the Naomi rainbow—bitchy, scared, confident, relieved, and more."
Criticism.
In addition to her popularity, Naomi has been the subject of criticism. In a review of the series premiere, Ray Richmond of "The Hollywood Reporter" labeled Naomi "vapid" and "prissy". Further criticism arose in the later episodes of Season 2, with reviewers citing her dishonesty and insensitivity during this period. While discussing the story in which Naomi makes false accusations of sexual harassment, "Entertainment Weekly"'s Archana Ram likened the character to her villainous sister Jen. Jethro Nededog of the "LA Times" also condemned Naomi's actions, but commended her for eventually revealing the truth.
At a later point in the season, Lisa Todorovich of "Zap2it" chastised Naomi for being "all about herself" while failing to support Liam during a series of troubles. While acknowledging Naomi's faults, which eventually lead to a break-up with Liam, Krista Navin of "MassLive.com" stated that "it is totally consistent with her character that she would want to try to be there for Liam, but just be too into her own drama to really be able to be. Also, I think it makes sense that someone like Liam would think he would want to be with someone like Naomi, and then be pretty disillusioned by the reality."
Award recognition.
For the role of Naomi Clark, McCord was nominated for a 2009 Teen Choice Award in the category of "Breakout Star Female". In 2010, she won a Breakthrough of the Year Award in the category of "Breakthrough Standout Performance".

Third Eurovision Dance Contest

The third Eurovision Dance Contest was originally planned to be organized in Baku, Azerbaijan at the Heydar Aliyev Sports and Exhibition Complex on 26 September 2009. İctimai Television was planning to achieve increase of number participating countries as well as inviting a world-famous star to host the contest, listing Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Minogue and Shakira as candidates. An additional extravaganza open-air concert was planned to be held, bringing together ex-participants of the Eurovision, Junior Eurovision and Eurovision Dance Contests on one stage.
However, on 28 May 2009, European Broadcasting Union has announced that the contest was postponed at least until Autumn 2010 as "the number of broadcasters that signed up for participation did not reach the desired level". According to a preliminary calculations, at least five countries that were taking part in Eurovision Dance Contest 2008, namely Austria, Finland, Lithuania, Netherlands and Sweden have announced withdrawal from the contest, with only Belarus confirmed its participation as newcomer country. 
On the date of cancellation, two countries have finished selection of the participating couples for the contest:
According to contest coordinator on behalf of EBU Tal Barnea "concrete plans for a 2010 autumn event are now being developed, with considerable changes to introduce a new programme proposal". These plans are expected to be unveiled in the autumn of 2009. EBU also praised "the commendable work on the next Eurovision Dance Contest already completed by our partners Ictimai Television and the Azerbaijani officials" stating that 2010 edition of the contest is planned to take place in Baku, Azerbaijan as well. 
In January 2010, EBU Eurovision coordinator, Svante Stockselius, announced that contest has been postponed again, and is now unlikely to happen at all, at least within the next couple of years. He explained this decision with the fact that the boom of the TV dance shows has calmed down recently.

Wheeler Shale

The Wheeler Shale (named by Charles Walcott) is a Cambrian ("c." 507 Ma) fossil locality world famous
for prolific agnostid and "Elrathia kingii" trilobite remains (even though many areas are barren of fossils)
and represents a Konzentrat-Lagerstätten. Varied soft bodied organisms are locally preserved, a fauna (including "Naraoia", "Wiwaxia" and "Hallucigenia") and preservation style (carbonaceous film) normally associated with the more famous Burgess Shale. As such, the Wheeler Shale also represents a Konservat-Lagerstätten. 
Together with the Marjum Formation and lower Weeks Formation, the Wheeler Shale forms 490 to 610 m (1,600 to 2,000 ft) of limestone and shale exposed in one of the thickest, most fossiliferous and best exposed sequences of Middle Cambrian rocks in North America.
At the type locality of Wheeler Amphitheater, House Range, Millard County, western Utah, the Wheeler Shale consists of a heterogeneous succession of highly calcareous shale, shaley limestone, mudstone and thin, flaggy limestone. The Wheeler Formation (although the Marjum & Weeks Formations are missing) extends into the Drum Range, northwest of the House Range where similar fossils and preservation are found.
Taphonomy & Sedimentology.
Detailed work recognises a number of ~10 m thick lagerstätten sequences in the formation, each of which formed at a sea-level high stand in deep water. The lagerstätte were deposited by turbidities and mudslides onto an oxygenated sea floor.
The productive layers comprise mud and clay particles, with a tiny fraction of wind-blown quartz.
Stratigraphy.
The Wheeler Shale spans the "Ptychagnostus atavus" and uppermost-Middle Cambrian "Bolaspidella" trilobite zones (See House Range) for full stratigraphy).

Joan Hornig

Joan Hornig is an American jewelry designer.
Background.
Education.
Joan Hornig graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard College in 1977 with a degree in fine arts before going on to get her MBA at Columbia Business School.
Career.
Hornig began her career in educational administration after briefly teaching art to elementary school children. In the late 1970s she worked as a capital campaign fund raiser, resident freshmen proctor and academic adviser at Harvard. Her career in the non-profit/higher education sector continued through the mid-1980s.
Hornig served as the Director of Corporate Relations and External Affairs at Columbia Business School prior to going to Wall Street in 1985. Her 20+ years of experience in the finance sector encompasses management, operations, administration, private equity, hedge funds, marketing and consulting. All the while she was creating jewelry inspired by her knowledge of art history and the decorative arts.
Joan Hornig Jewelry.
Hornig designs jewelry around the idea "Philanthropy is Beautiful." The jewelry is constructed with 18k gold, diamonds, south sea pearls, precious, semi-precious stones and other materials such as lucite, silver and leather.
My knowledge of art history has a very strong influence on my designs. Because I have such a broad knowledge of different aesthetics from different times and cultures, I have developed my own definition of proportion, color and materials that enhance, not overwhelm, wearers. My love and passion for traveling has contributed at least as much to my inspiration. The desire to beautify is everywhere, but local traditions, landscapes and natural resources strongly affect the styles of fashions and help define what is beautiful in different parts of the world. Only through experiencing them first hand through travel can I most effectively incorporate what I learn.
The Joan B. Hornig Foundation.
In 2003, Hornig developed a way to combine her passion for jewelry, education and philanthropy through the creation of the Joan B. Hornig Foundation.
The foundation's mission is to provide support for registered charitable organizations throughout the world.
Those choosing to purchase Joan Hornig designs are meant to derive pleasure not only from the jewelry, but also from the meaning of giving back. All profits from each item are donated to charity. Purchasers are able to direct the donation to a charity of their choice, in their honor.
Each time a new charity is chosen by a Joan Hornig Jewelry wearer, that organization is added to Hornig's list of non-profits that benefit from the sale of her jewelry. Up-to-date list of benfiting non-profits
Sales to date have generated substantial contributions to over 700 different organizations across the globe.
Retail locations.
In 2003, Hornig began her retail business at Bergdorf Goodman in New York City. Joan Hornig Jewelry is sold in Bergdorf Goodman as well as department stores and fine jewelry retailers including Neiman Marcus, Sabbia, Tootsies and Halls of Kansas City.

Dave Gage

Dave Gage (born 1957) is an American harmonica player and instructor, recording artist, author, and webmaster, known for harmonica web sites and more than twenty-five years of session work in recording studios throughout Southern California. 
Gage plays both diatonic and chromatic "harps," as the harmonica is informally known. He is a veteran of several bands, most recently the eponymous "Gage," and an acknowledged master of the "tongue switching" technique that modifies standard harmonica tongue blocking to create a rock-guitar effect similar to the tapping made famous by guitarist Eddie Van Halen Eddie Van Halen. As the reviewers from Planet Harmonica stated, "Dave Gage puts forward a modern Rock/Heavy Metal approach rather than a bluesy one, although his style doesn't depart as radically from blues as say, John Popper's."
Biography.
Looking for a way to round out content on a website devoted to an early iteration of his band, Gage began posting harmonica tips to the web in 1997. Those tips proved popular with visitors, and Gage soon realized the utility of consolidating his web-based harmonica instruction into its own site. The result, Harmonicalessons.com, has since become the largest and most-visited web site of its kind in the world.
Gage has taught harmonica to students of all levels at McCabe’s Guitar Shop, in Santa Monica, California since 1980. His television credits include bumper and theme music for shows such as "Davis Rules" (ABC, 1991-1992) and "Adventures in Wonderland" (Disney Channel, 1993-1995), as well as numerous TV and radio commercials. His film credits include harmonica playing, along with Tommy Morgan, for "Without a Paddle".
Gage plays many different styles of music and studied jazz improvisation with vibraphonist Charlie Shoemake, but he is most closely associated with rock. His live performances around Los Angeles, according to his own website, typically draw rave reviews. He has recorded or played with members of such bands as Devo, Black Sabbath, and The Police. Outside the recording studio and various gigs, he also worked as a product consultant for the Hohner and Lee Oskar harmonica companies. 
The Gage discography includes "Well You Can’t Now, Can You?" (1991, rated 9 out of 10 by "Music Connection" magazine) and "Love You Just the Same" (2000, on his own AYM label).

Abell 39

Abell 39 is a low surface brightness planetary nebula in the constellation of Hercules. It is the 39th entry in George Abell's 1966 Abell Catalog of Planetary Nebulae (and 27th in his 1955 catalog) of 86 old planetary nebulae which either Abell or Albert George Wilson discovered before August 1955 as part of the National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. It is estimated to be about 6,800 light-years from earth and 4,600 light-years above the Galactic plane. It is almost perfectly spherical and also one of the largest known spheres with a radius of about 2.5 light-years.
Central star.
Its central star is slightly west of center by about 2″ or 0.1 light-years. This offset does not appear to be due to interaction with the interstellar medium, but instead, it is hypothesized that a small asymmetric
mass ejection has accelerated the central star. The mass of the central star is estimated to be about 0.61 M☉ with the material in the planetary nebula comprising an additional 0.6 M☉.
This planetary nebula has a nearly uniform spherical shell. However, the eastern limb of the nebula is 50% more luminous than the western limb. Additionally, irregularities in the surface brightness are seen across the face of the shell. The source of the east-west asymmetry is not known but it could be related to the offset of the central star.
Structure and composition.
The bright rim of the planetary nebula has an average thickness of about 10″.1 or about 0.34 light-years. There is a faint halo that extends about 18″ beyond the bright rim giving a complete diameter of around 190″ under the assumption that this emission is uniform around the planetary nebula.
This planetary nebula has been expanding for an estimated 22,100 years, based on an assumed expansion velocity between 32 and 37 km/s and a 0.78 parsec radius.
Background galaxies are visible near the nebula, and some can be seen through the translucent nebula.
Oxygen is only about half as abundant in the nebula as it is in our own sun.

John C. Ostlund

John Chapman Ostlund (September 29, 1927 – April 27, 2004) was a diversified businessman from Gillette and Cheyenne, Wyoming, who served in the Wyoming State Senate from 1973 to 1978, when he resigned to seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As the GOP nominee, he came within 1 percentage point of unseating Democratic Governor Edgar Herschler of Kemmerer in Lincoln County in western Wyoming. Ostlund lost his sight in 1985 because of complications from diabetes. Thereafter, he became an advocate of the blind and penned his memoirs to benefit the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind in Smithtown, New York.
Early years, education, military.
Ostlund was the second son born to Axel William Ostlund (1891–1982) and the former Mary Spence "Polly" Roberts (1902–1980) in Gillette, the seat of Campbell County in northeastern Wyoming. In 1944, he graduated from Campbell County High School and then entered Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, which closed in 2002. He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, from Republican U.S. Senator Frank A. Barrett of Wyoming. He graduated in 1949 with the commission of ensign and served on the destroyer "Meredith" in the Mediterranean Sea. The diagnosis of diabetes required him to retire from the Navy in 1950. During a stay at St. Albans Naval Hospital on Long Island, New York, he met the Navy nurse Ensign Mary Virginia Ryan (born 1928). On January 13, 1952, the couple wed in Mount Vernon, New York. They settled in his native Gillette.
Ostlund and his brother, Axel R. "Bob" Ostlund, were involved in a multitude of business activities in Gillette: John Deere Farm Machinery, plumbing and heating, sheet metal, banking, and the construction and operation of motels and restaurants. Their interest also reached into manufacturing, real estate, investments, agri-business, and mineral leasing and exploration.
Political and community service.
Ostlund was chairman of the Campbell County Republican Party from 1961 to 1969. He then served for several years as a state Republican committeeman. In 1969, Governor Stanley K. Hathaway named Ostlund to the board of trustees of the University of Wyoming at Laramie. During his term, UW developed its Fine Arts Center.
In 1972, Ostlund unseated state Senator Richard A. Mader (1923–2001) of Gillette in the Republican primary to represent Campbell and neighboring Johnson County, which was the site of a notorious range war in the early 1890s. He won the general election in the fall and was reelected in 1976. The 1970s were a time when Wyoming, and particularly Campbell County, were experiencing growth in mineral development. Ostlund, a conservative Republican, was chairman of the Senate Mines, Minerals and Industrial Development Committee and was involved in the development of the Wyoming Community Development Authority, the Coal Tax for Impact Assistance, and the School Foundation Program to finance capital facilities. Ostlund listed his most important accomplishment as the acquisition of the land for the "Camplex", the multi-activities center for Campbell County.
In the spring of 1978, Ostlund resigned from the state Senate to run for governor. In the primary, he polled 40,251 votes (58.9 percent) to defeat Gus A. Fleischli (born February 1, 1926), a Rawlins native who was in the petroleum business in Cheyenne, who received 24,824 ballots (36.4 percent). In a mostly Democratic year nationally, Ostlund was then defeated in the general election by Herschler: 67,595 votes (49.1 percent) to 69,972 (50.9 percent). Four years earlier as the GOP nominee, trucking executive and former State Senator Dick Jones of Cody in Park County received 56,645 (44.1 percent) to Herschler's 71,741 (55.9 percent). Ostlund hence ran 10,950 votes ahead of Jones, but Jones faced voters in a more heavily Democratic year nationally. 
From 1970 to 1995, the Ostlunds owned the historic Remount Ranch twenty-three miles west of the capital city of Cheyenne. During the early years, the ranch was a weekend home, but it was a full-time residence for the last eleven years until it was sold. The couple made extensive restorations to the property and hosted civic, educational, and social functions there. By 1985, Ostlund had gradually lost his sight but continued many community activities, including service on the board of the Wells Fargo Bank, the Cheyenne United Medical Center Foundation, the Governor’s Mansion Foundation and the acclaimed Old West Museum in Cheyenne. He was also a member of Cheyenne Rotary International and the Cheyenne Young Men’s Literary Club. In 1995, the Ostlunds relocated to Cheyenne and sold Remount to the Bangert family, which returned it to his previous status as a working ranch.
Death and legacy.
In 2001, Ostlund published his autobiography, "Quite a Life", which he dedicated to his eight grandchildren. All proceeds from the sale of the book were donated to the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind, the organization from which he obtained his two guide dogs. His most recent dog, Russ, died unexpectedly several weeks before Ostlund's own passing. Ostlund sometimes took his guide dogs into elementary school classrooms to demonstrate how he and the dogs worked as a team to assist him in maintaining his many activities. Despite his handicap, Ostlund maintained many private interests, including playing the piano.
Ostlund died at his home in Cheyenne. In addition to his wife and brother, he was survived by his eight children: Peg Ostlund of Cheyenne, John Ostlund, Jr., of Westminster, Colorado; Nancy Essery of San Diego, California; Tom Ostlund of Cheyenne, Karin Ostlund of Denver; Patrick Ostlund of Douglas, Wyoming; Jane Gebhart and Scott Ostlund, both of Gillette. A mass of Christian burial was delivered on May 3, 2004, at St. Matthew's Catholic Church in Gillette.

Capsospongia

Capsospongia is a middle Cambrian sponge genus known from 2 specimens in the Burgess shale. It has a narrow base, and consists of bulging rings which get wider further up the sponge, resulting in a conical shape. Its open top was presumably used to expel water that had passed through the sponge cells and been filtered for nutrients.
Like most sponges, "Capsospoingia" had a spicular skeleton; long spicules parallel to the growth direction formed columns which were connected by shorter lateral spicules.

Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)

"Poker Face" is a song by American recording artist and songwriter Lady Gaga from her debut album, "The Fame" (2008). Produced by RedOne, it was released as the album's second single in late 2008 for some markets and in early 2009 for the rest of the world. "Poker Face" is an uptempo synthpop song in the key of A minor, following in the footsteps of her previous single "Just Dance" but with a darker musical tone. The main idea behind the song is bisexuality and was a tribute by Gaga to her rock and roll boyfriends. Lyrically, the track is about a woman engaged in the practice of cockteasing.
"Poker Face" was acclaimed by most critics, who praised the robotic hook and the chorus. The song attained worldwide success, topping the charts in twenty countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many European countries. "Poker Face" was the most downloaded song in the British chart in 2009. It is among the best-selling singles of all time, having sold over thirteen million copies. The accompanying music video for the song portrays Gaga singing it in various costumes and playing strip poker in a getaway villa.
Gaga performed the song for the eighth season of the television show "American Idol" as well as the Fame Ball and Monster Ball tours. The live performances included an electronic version and an acoustic version, which she played on the piano. It was nominated for both Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the 52nd Grammy Awards, and won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. "Rolling Stone" ranked it number ninety-six on their list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s decade. In October 2011, "NME" placed it at number 103 on its list "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".
Background.
"Poker Face" was written by Gaga and RedOne, while production was handled by RedOne. Gaga stated in an interview that "Poker Face" was written by her as a pop song and was a tribute to her "rock 'n' roll boyfriends". She also stated that the main idea behind the song was sex and gambling. In an interview with UK's "Daily Star", Gaga noted of the song, "It's about a lot of different things. I gamble but I’ve also dated a lot of guys who are really into sex and booze and gambling, so I wanted to write a record my boyfriends would like too." In an interview with "Rolling Stone" magazine, when asked about the meaning of the line "bluffin' with my muffin", Gaga explained that it really was a metaphor for her vulva.
"Obviously, it's my pussy's poker face! I took that line from another song I wrote but never released, called 'Blueberry Kisses.' It was about a girl singing to her boyfriend about how she wants him to go down on her, and I used the lyric. sings 'Blueberry kisses, the muffin man misses them kisses'."
During her Fame Ball Tour performance at Palm Springs, California, on April 11, 2009, Gaga explained to the crowd the true meaning behind the term "Poker Face" used in the song. She suggested that the song dealt with her personal experience with bisexuality. The idea behind the song was to be with a man but fantasizing about a woman, hence the man in the song needs to read her "Poker Face" to understand what is going through her mind. The idea was taken from AC/DC's song "The Jack" off their "High Voltage" release.
Composition.
"Poker Face" is an uptempo synthpop song, and follows the footsteps of the previous single "Just Dance". Whereas "Just Dance" was predominately electropop, "Poker Face" carries a dark sound with clear vocals on the chorus and a pop hook while combining the synths from "Just Dance" and the more dance-oriented beat of the next single "LoveGame". According to Kerri Mason of "Billboard", the composition "carr the pleather-and-sequins vibe of the downtown New York scene out of the underground and onto the FM dial without losing its smut and sass."
According to the sheet music published in Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the note C5 to the note G3. It begins with a medium tempo followed by electronic chord arrangement and the "Mum-mum-mum-mah" hook. The chords follow in this order: Am–F/A–G, and then for the chorus Am–F–C–G. This is followed by the sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments, and a stuttering hook following the chorus.
Lyrically, "Poker Face" is all about sexual innuendo and teasing. According to "Daily Star", the chorus repeats two alternating lyrics. After the hook "Can't read my Poker Face" the backup singer says "He's got me like nobody" and then in the next line says "She's got me like nobody". Gaga explained in an interview with them that the line carries a bit of an undertone of confusion about love and sex. However, the liner notes from the album booklet indicate both these lines only repeat "she's got me like nobody". According to BBC, the "Mum-mum-mum-mah" hook used in the song references Boney M.'s 1977 hit "Ma Baker".
Critical reception.
Upon release, "Poker Face" received critical acclaim. Priya Elan from "The Times", in a review for "The Fame", said that "Poker Face" was one of the finest moments of the album with its "love-as-card-game cheek". BBC Music reviewed the "strut-tastic" single as "expressing her overwhelming desire for celebrity and fortune." Bill Lamb of About.com said, "'Poker Face' works well on pop radio, but with slight mixing alterations it would be equally at home in a dark, sweaty, late night party atmosphere. She has refreshed the pop world in the US and UK at one of the slowest times of the year. 'Poker Face' keeps the motors humming as everyone waits for the next step forward from Lady Gaga." Chris Williams of "Billboard" also gave a positive review of the song saying, "Once again, hooks are aplenty, with '80s-inspired synthesizers, robotic verses and a warm, sunny hook in the chorus, which is even more addictive than the previous single ('Just Dance')...With a focused artistic vision, a swagger in her interview style and above all, a fantastic collection of diverse pop nuggets, Gaga is playing her cards right—and "Poker" is another obvious ace."
Slant Magazine music reviewer Sal Cinquemani included "Poker Face" among the songs that work in "The Fame", namely tracks like "Starstruck," "Paper Gangsta" and "Summerboy". Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the song "infectious" and along with the title track "The Fame", complimented them for "rejuvenating the vibe on the album for its second half." Andy Downing from "The Chicago Tribune" called the song "jaunty" while reviewing Gaga's Fame Ball tour. Evan Sawdey from PopMatters.com felt that "Poker Face" along with the track "Paparazzi", duplicate much of the same "glitzy territory that previous single 'Just Dance' had covered, but never once does it feel like Gaga is deliberately repeating herself." "Rolling Stone" in a review for The Fame Ball Tour compared the live acoustic "bluesy" version of "Poker Face" with the music of singer Amy Winehouse. Erika Hobert from the "New Times Broward-Palm Beach" newspaper called the song "trashtastic Europop." The song was nominated for Grammy Awards in the categories for Song of The Year, Record of The Year, and Best Dance Recording, ultimately winning the last of these.

She performed the piano version wearing a dress made of plastic transparent bubbles and playing the glass piano with her stilletoes with a glowing mannequin, like the music video, standing in front of the stage. Gaga claimed that the transparent bubble filled piano was specifically made to match her dress. The actual version was performed by Gaga as the final song of the encore, after "Boys, Boys, Boys".

The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience while revealing an open zipper, patched over her left eye. The performance was described an "alien-disco performance art." Cortney Harding of "Billboard" wrote, "was Gaga's crowning TV moment ... show middle America that she was a bona fide pop star."

A remixed version of "Poker Face" and "LoveGame" was performed at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards, during the indoor-outdoor streetside show. This performance, which included Gaga being trapped in a fake subway car surrounded by fake police officers, was billed as a tribute to New York City.

<doc id="19206395" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19206395" title="Papal conclave, 1458">
Papal conclave, 1458

The Papal conclave of 1458 (August 16–19, 1458) convened after the death of Pope Callixtus III, elected as his successor Cardinal Enea Silvio Piccolomini, who took the name Pius II.
Death of Callixtus III.
Pope Callixtus III, the first pope of the House of Borgia, died on August 6, 1458. He was severely criticized due to his nepotism and devotion towards his compatriots of Catalonia, very unpopular among the rather xenophobic Roman populace. After the Pope's death an open revolt against had broken up and some of his partisans (e.g. his nephew Pedro Luis de Borja) had to flee Rome.
List of participants.
At the time of Callixtus' death, there were 27 living cardinals, of whom 19 were in Rome, but on August 14 Cardinal Domenico Capranica, archpriest of the College, unexpectedly died. In the conclave participated 18 out of 26 members of the Sacred College:
Eight electors were Italian, five Spaniards, two French, two Greeks and one Portuguese. Seven of them were created by Callistus III, six by Eugenius IV, four by Nicholas V and one by Martin V.
Absentees.
Eight cardinals did not participate in this conclave:
Of the absentee cardinals four were creatures of Eugenius IV, two of Nicholas V and one of Callixtus III. Pierre de Foix was the last surviving cardinal of the Great Western Schism and was elevated by Pisan Antipope John XXIII.
Among them there were three French, two Germans, one Spaniard, one Italian and the one Hungarian.
Candidates to the papacy.
The principal concerns in the conclave of 1458 arose from the rapid rise of the effective power and influence of the French monarchy in the closing years of the Hundred Years War, which had recentely ended with the French victory. The principal Italian states – Kingdom of Naples, Republic of Genoa and Duchy of Milan – feared a rebirth of French interest in Italian affairs and tried to prevent the elevation of a French pope at all costs. The official candidate of the Milanese was Domenico Capranica. The campaign for his election in the preconclave period was so successful that it appeared almost certain that he would be elected to the papacy. But Cardinal Capranica died suddenly on August 14, 1458, two days before the beginning of the conclave, leaving his party in a great confusion. Ottone de Carretto, ambassador of Milan in Rome, made the quick and unconsulted decision to support Cardinal Enea Piccolomini and managed to convince Latino Orsini, one of the most influential cardinals, to back him in this action. The principal candidate of the pro-French party was d'Estouteville. Bessarion, Torquemada and Calandrini also were considered papabile.
The conclave.
Eighteen cardinals entered the conclave in Vatican on August 16. Initially they subscribed the conclave capitulation, which obliged the elect to continue the crusade against the Ottoman Empire and to give more welfare to poorer cardinals.
The first scrutiny took place only on August 18. Cardinals Piccolomini and Calandrini received five votes each, while none of the others obtained more than three. At this point French Cardinal d'Estouteville started the intensive simonical campaign for his own candidature. He promised the office of Vice-Chancellor to the Cardinal of Avignon and offered other bribes to the Greek cardinals. On August 18 in the evening he was certain that he would obtain at least eleven votes on the following morning But the opposite Italian party also lost no time. During the night Cardinal Pietro Barbo called together all the other Italian cardinals except Prospero Colonna and proposed to them that, of them all, the one most likely to obtain the required majority of two thirds was Piccolomini, and that all should support him on the following day.
Election of Pius II.
The results of the second ballot on August 19 in the morning were a greatly disappointing surprise for d'Estouteville. He received only six votes – those of de Coëtivy, Colonna, Bessarion, Fieschi, Torquemada, and Castiglione. Cardinal Piccolomini obtained nine votes – those of Barbo, Orsini, Calandrini, Isidore of Kiev, de Mella, de La Cerda, Jaime de Portugal, del Mila y Borja, and that of d'Estouteville, who hesitated to vote for himself but certainly did not consider Piccolomini a serious rival. The votes of Rodrigo Borgia, Giacomo Tebaldi and Enea Piccolomini fell to other candidates. After the announcing the results, Cardinal Dean opened the customary procedure of the accessus. There was a long silence broken by Rodrigo Borgia who changed his vote to Piccolomini. Then the partisans of d'Estouteville made an attempt to adjourn the session, but Cardinal Tebaldi also changed his vote to Piccolomini, who needed only one vote more for the election. At this point Cardinal Colonna arose and called out before anyone could restrain him: "I also vote for the Cardinal of Siena, and I make him Pope!" The rest of the adherents of the Cardinal of Rouen could do nothing but change their votes too, and a few minutes later Cardinal Bessarion congratulated Piccolomini on his unanimous election to the papacy.
Cardinal Enea Silvio Piccolomini accepted his election and took the name Pius II. On September 3, 1458 he was solemnly crowned in the steps of the patriarchal Vatican Basilica by Cardinal Prospero Colonna, protodeacon of S. Giorgio in Velabro.

Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad)

The Overland Route was a train route operated jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad / Southern Pacific Railroad, between Council Bluffs, Iowa / Omaha, Nebraska, and San Francisco, California over the grade of the First Transcontinental Railroad (aka the ""Pacific Railroad"") which had been opened on May 10, 1869. Passenger trains that operated over the line included the "Overland Flyer", later renamed the "Overland Limited", which also included a connection to Chicago. Although these passenger rail trains are no longer in operation, the Overland Route remains a common name for the line from California to Chicago, now owned entirely by the Union Pacific.
History.
The name harkens back to the Central Overland Route, a stagecoach line operated by the "Overland Mail Company" between Salt Lake City, Utah and Virginia City, Nevada from 1861 to 1866, when Wells Fargo & Company took over the stagecoach's operation. Wells Fargo ended this stagecoach service three years later.
While the Council Bluffs/Omaha to San Francisco "Pacific Railroad" grade was opened in 1869, the name “Overland” was not formally adopted for any daily extra-fare train over the route until almost two decades later when the Union Pacific inaugurated service of its "Overland Flyer" on November 13, 1887, between Omaha and Ogden, Utah, where passengers and through cars were transferred to the Southern Pacific which had acquired the CPRR’s operations on that line in 1885 under a 99-year lease. The UP changed its designation to the "Overland Limited" on November 17, 1895, and service continued as a daily train under that name in one form or another for almost seven decades. For the first dozen years that the SP met the UP’s "Overland" trains, however, it dubbed its service the "Ogden Gateway Route" with its connecting westbound trains operating as the "Pacific Express" and eastbound trains as the "Atlantic Express" before finally adopting the name the "Overland Limited" in 1899 for its portion of the run as well.
The original 1,911 miles of the route from Omaha to San Francisco traversed some of the most desolate (as well some of the most picturesque) lands of the western two-thirds of the North American continent. While the trip originally took early low fare emigrant trains a full week (or more) to complete, by 1906 the electric lighted all-Pullman "Overland Limited" covered the route in just 56 hours.
E. H. Harriman bought the bankrupt Union Pacific in 1897; in 1901 he assumed control of the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific as well. The rebuilding of the Overland Route followed: hundreds of miles of double track, hundreds of miles of signals, and dozens of realignments to reduce grades, curvature, and perhaps distance. (The rebuilding actually started before the CP/SP acquisition—the map in the May 1969 issue of "Trains" shows Howell to Bosler realigned in 1899.)
By 1926 the UPRR route from Council Bluffs/Omaha to Ogden was continuous double track, except for the Aspen Tunnel (east of Evanston, Wyoming) which remained a bottleneck until 1949. The CPRR/SPRR portion of the route was also largely double tracked during this period, with the completion of such projects as the 1909 Hood Realignment between Rocklin and Newcastle, double tunneling along the Sierra Grade including at Cisco and the summit (Tunnel #41), and the 1924 agreement to share tracks across Nevada with the Western Pacific Railroad's Feather River Route.
Among the most important improvements to the original grade was the Lucin Cutoff, a completely new stretch from just west of Ogden to Lucin, a few miles east of the Nevada border. It included a 12-mile (19 km) trestle on wooden pilings across the Great Salt Lake. Opened in 1904, this line cut off the line, eliminated 3,919 degrees of curvature, and removed of climb from the route, thus decreasing the steepest SP grade east of Lucin from 90 feet per mile to 21.
But many other sections of the original 1860s grade were harder to improve on, notably over the Sierra Nevada between Colfax, California, and Reno, Nevada. The newer second track follows a better route here and there, but the original route changed little (except for the removal of the wooden snowsheds, or their replacement by nonflammable concrete ones) until the 1993 abandonment of the 6.7-mile section of the Track No. 1 crossing of the summit between Norden and Eder which includes the original Summit Tunnel (No. 6). Traffic was sent instead over the easier-to-maintain Track No. 2 and through the tunnel called “The Big Hole” (No. 41) which had been driven under Mt. Judah a mile south of the Pass when that portion of the line was double tracked in 1925. Aside from those modifications the Sierra grade looks much the same to train passengers as it did when the line opened in 1868.
Connection to Chicago.
Initially operated by the Milwaukee Road, the operation of the Overland Route between Chicago and Omaha was assumed by the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1889, an arrangement that continued for sixty-six years. In 1955, the passenger operations east of Omaha were again assumed by the Milwaukee Road.
Demise.
As intercity passenger rail travel began to decline after World War II and into the 1950s with the growth of the airline industry and development of the Interstate Highway System, the Overland route gradually lost its luster and service declined. In 1955 the Overland became an Omaha-Oakland train, with no Chicago connection, and after summer 1956 it was coach-only east of Ogden/Green River—no sleepers, no diner, and no name. In 1960 even that remnant ceased running between Ogden and Laramie. After almost seven decades of continuous operation, the "Overland Limited" came to an end as a daily train on July 16, 1962, when the Interstate Commerce Commission approved termination of the service. While the train continued to run until Labor Day (with some additional holiday runs from Christmas to the New Year), the name “Overland” did not appear in the schedules of the UP or SP again after its last run on January 2, 1963. The only daily passenger train service between Omaha and San Francisco today is provided by the "California Zephyr" (now via the Central Corridor, passing through Denver and Salt Lake City) operated by the US government-owned Amtrak which took over all long-haul intercity passenger train service in the United States in May, 1971. In 1996, the Union Pacific again acquired the Southern Pacific, resulting in the entire Chicago-Oakland line being owned by a single company.
Route description.
Council Bluffs/Omaha to Ogden (via the Union Pacific).
Heading west from Council Bluffs/Omaha over the same wide open plains of Nebraska’s Platte River Valley that had been followed by so many wagon trains in the 1840s, ‘50s, and ‘60s, the “Overland” passed first through Lincoln, Grand Island, and Kearney (196 miles from Omaha) where all the wagon trails from the Missouri River communities between Omaha and Kansas City had once converged. There the famous Fort Kearney had been built by the U.S. Army in 1858 to protect the Oregon–California Trail heading west, and from which, under the direction of Union Generals U.S. Grant and W.T. Sherman, soldiers had been dispatched to protect UP surveyors and construction crews from Indian attack as the road progressed across Nebraska towards Wyoming.
By the time travelers on the “Overland” crossed into Wyoming at Pine Bluffs, they had traveled some 470 miles westward and risen in elevation above sea level from the 1,033 feet at Omaha to 5,047. The Rocky Mountains first came into passengers’ view 20 miles further on at Hillsdale with the appearance of the dark crests of the Laramie Range. Thirty-six miles further west the route reached Sherman, the highest point on the line at 8,013 feet, on a high and rugged upland with bold rock masses eroded into fantastic, picturesque shapes.
The route crossed the Continental Divide at Creston, some 737 miles west of Omaha. At Green River passengers were treated to views of two of the most spectacular rock formations in Wyoming—Man’s Face directly southwest of the station, and Castle Rock just north of it. Six miles after crossing the Bear River at Evanston the “Overland” entered Utah, a land which would provide passengers with close-up views of some of the most unusual and spectacular rock formations of the entire trip.
After passing Henefer where Brigham Young and his Mormon pioneers had turned southward in 1847 to cross the Wasatch Mountains into Emigration Cañon, perhaps the two most famous features on the Union Pacific’s section of the Overland, Thousand Mile Tree and Devil's Slide, came into view on the west, and south sides of the track, respectively. Entering the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, the train soon reached Ogden, some 1,029 miles from Omaha. Here the Union Pacific lines diverged to Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest while the Southern Pacific (which acquired operational control of the CPRR’s original Pacific route under lease in 1885) took charge of the “Overland Limited” on to San Francisco.
Ogden to San Francisco (via the Central Pacific/Southern Pacific).
For the first 35 years after the driving of the “Last Spike” at Promontory Summit in 1869, all trains heading in and out of Ogden on the SP passed over the site of that seminal event as they made their way around the northern end of the Great Salt Lake. In November 1903, however, the SP opened the Lucin Cutoff, a 102.9-mile stretch of new track featuring a spectacular 12-mile long trestle built on pilings across the Great Salt Lake. Ten miles past Lucin, the “Overland” crossed into Nevada at Tecoma, the nearest railroad town to the silver, copper, and lead mines discovered in the region in 1874.
Passing through other western Nevada mining centers and through Wells, an important supply point on the old Emigrant Trail, the line then followed the valley of the 300-mile long Humboldt River. Devil’s Peak, a perpendicular rock rising 500 feet from the edge of the Humboldt River, dominated the canyon scenery at Palisade while the last major stop in Nevada was Reno with the Sierra Nevada mountains dominating the view ahead.
The next hundred miles of grade from Reno to Colfax, California were by far the most challenging to build and provided the most impressive views of the whole route, although for much of that stretch passengers could see nothing as trains traveled through miles of tunnels and snowsheds. After passing Verdi, Nevada, the site in November, 1870, of the first train robbery on the Pacific coast, the Overland crossed into California and followed the Truckee River up a picturesque canyon to the town of Truckee on Donner Lake where the ill-fated George Donner party had been snowbound in the winter of 1846–7.
A serpentine climb around the east end of the lake and up Mt. Judah brought the Overland to the Summit Tunnel at 7,018 feet at Donner Pass and the start of a 105-mile descent to Sacramento located just 35 feet above sea level. Travel over this section could be quite treacherous in the winter as the Southern Pacific had to deal with clearing as much as 50 to 60 feet of snowfall as well as ice from water dripping in the tunnels. The miles of showsheds needed to keep the line passable left the impression among passengers that they were “railroading in a tunnel” for much of the route. The wooden snowsheds also presented another challenge of railroading “over the hill,” however, as fires were often started by lightning strikes or embers from steam locomotives.
Still there were some spectacular views available to passengers in the Sierras, the most famous of which was that from “Cape Horn” just above the town of Colfax where the grade was literally carved out of the side of a mountain, providing a glorious panoramic view across Green Valley of the American River flowing in a canyon some 1,322 feet below. This spot was so popular that for many years the Southern Pacific stopped the Overland and most other trains for a few minutes so that passengers could get off the train and take it all in from a special observation area.
When the route opened in 1869, trains reached the San Francisco Bay area from Sacramento via a 140 mile line (built by the original Western Pacific Railroad) by way of Stockton over Altamont Pass, and on through Niles Cañon first to a pier at Alameda, and shortly thereafter to the nearby two-mile long Oakland Long Wharf (later called the "SP Mole") from which San Francisco was then accessed by ferry. In 1876, however, the CPRR acquired a line built by the California Pacific Railroad from Sacramento to Vallejo and in 1879 completed an extension of that road 17 miles across the Suisun Marsh to Benicia. There the CPRR established a ferry service to carry its trains a little more than a mile across the Carquinez Strait to Port Costa from which they ran down the southern shoreline of the Strait and San Pablo Bay, and then along eastern side of the San Francisco Bay to the Oakland Long Wharf, thereby cutting approximately fifty miles off the journey from Sacramento. After half a century of operation, however, the train ferry between was replaced by a massive drawbridge built by the SP between Benicia and Martinez which opened in October, 1930, and is still in use today.

The Barcud Derwen Group

The Barcud Derwen Group was an independent group of television and AV facilities in Cardiff, Wales which claimed to be the largest in the UK outside of London. It is now in administration.
Company history.
The original company, Barcud, was formed in 1982 by independent producers, to provide TV production facilities, originally for independent companies based in Caernarfon, Gwynedd working for S4C. However the group now provides facilities for producers working for all of Wales' broadcasters, as well as many network and international producers and broadcasters.
The merger with Derwen [http://www.derwen.com] - a Cardiff based post production facility - in 1992 created Barcud Derwen. The new company then began a process of expansion. In 1990(?) the company issued shares to the public to finance the building of Studio 1 in Caernarfon. The company is owned by its 200+ shareholders.
The Barcud Derwen Group sold its share in the previously owned or part owned: Men from Mars now part of Century Communications,[http://www.century-communication.com/CCLWebsiteFinal09042007.swf. Platform Post and The Farm [http://www.thefarm.ie/

Dadar Parsi Colony

Dadar Parsi Colony (officially Mancherji Joshi Parsi Colony) is an upper class Parsi colony in midtown south Mumbai. It is situated in the locality of Dadar-Matunga. Unlike the other Parsi Colonies (also known as 'baugs', literally gardens) is it not surrounded by a wall or fence and is not isolated from its surroundings. The colony houses the famous Five Gardens created by Mancherji Joshi, a renowned Parsi.
It is the largest Zoroastrian enclave in the world, and in 2009, out of the 45,000 Zoroastrians living in Mumbai, 10,000 lived in Dadar Parsi Colony.
History.
This area was established for Parsis through the efforts of Mr Mancherji Edalji Joshi, the founder of the Dadar Parsi Colony (M Joshi Colony).
The area was built by the British under the Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme of 1899-1900, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay. The Bombay City Improvement Trust formulated this plan in order to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the Mumbai plague epidemics of the 1890s. According to the survey plan, 60,000 people were to be housed at Dadar-Matunga and an equal number in Sion-Matunga. 85,000 people were to be accommodated in the developments in Sewri-Wadala.
The plans regulated constructions with emphasis on proper sanitation. No building was to be more than three storeys high, and the buildings were to have open spaces between them. The land-use was planned to be a mix of residential, commercial and institutional constructions. Parks and gardens were planned, and the streets were well laid out.
Dadar was away from Crawford Market by the newly constructed Mohammedali Road. The tramways were extended to this new suburb. The GIP constructed a bridge, now the Tilak Bridge, connecting the two suburban railways. Soon, in February 1925, the GIP Railways opened their suburban line, and started the work of electrifying the railways. Among the institutions which moved here according to the BCIP plan were the VJTI, the Sydenham College of Commerce and Wadia Vachha now known as J.B.Vachha high school for parsi girls
This posh colony in south Mumbai is home to an estimated 15,000 or more Parsis, which is by far the largest concentration of Parsis in Mumbai, and possibly the world.
Education.
The Dadar Parsi Youth Assembly (DPYA) High School lies in this vicinity.
Notable residents.
British musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the rock band Queen, Freddie Mercury was an Indian Parsi and a resident of Dadar Parsi Colony. Jimi Mistry and family are another famous family living in the renowned Della Tower.

Clarkston High School (Washington)

Charles Francis Adams High School, locally referred to as Clarkston High School or CHS, is a four-year public high school located near downtown Clarkston, Washington. The school has a population of 800-850 students, over 100 staff members, and holds grades 9-12.
Clarkston High School's mission statement is as follows: "In order that the students of today be ready for the challenges of citizenship tomorrow, Clarkston High School will encourage and empower students to take pride, responsibility, and ownership in seeking their highest personal and academic achievement in a safe, positive, creative environment." The school administration also uses the acronym PRIDE (Personal Responsibility In Daily Effort) to encourage students to take accountability of their actions and remember that only the students alone can control their motivations. 
CHS's mascot is the mighty Bantam. The school colors are red, black and white. CHS's rivals are the Lewiston Bengals, from Lewiston High School, immediately across the Snake River from Clarkston, in the State of Idaho. Part of their rivalry includes the Golden Throne competition that takes place every January. The schools compete against each other to raise money for charity through a week-long competition called Spirit Links, where for a small amount one can buy a paper link of a chain which represents how much money each particular school raises. There is also a basketball game at the end of the week, where sportsmanship determines the winner of the "Golden Throne"- a glitter-gold toilet mounted on a platform. Whoever wins the Throne gets to display it at their school for the rest of the year.
Activities.
Clarkston High School offers a variety of sports, clubs and activities for students to participate in throughout the school year. 
Sports offered in the fall include: cross country, football, girl's swim, girl's soccer and volleyball. Winter sports include: boy's basketball, girl's basketball and wrestling. Spring sports include: baseball, softball, tennis, track and boy's soccer. 
Other activities offered:
CHS also participates yearly in the national Junior Miss scholarship program, in which eleventh-grade level girls are eligible to participate.
Awards.
Clarkston High School was awarded the 2008 State Superintendent's Learning Improvement Award, along with 97 other elementary-, middle-, high- and alternative schools, out of approximately 2,500 schools in Washington state. Progress was measured by the scores of six years of data from the Washington Assessment of Student Learning, or the WASL.
Clarkston also won the Golden Throne girls basketball game and spirit competition, but were outplayed by the Mighty Bengals during the boys game where seniors Ben Havens, Greg Pederson, and James Baerlocher lead their team on a heroic battle to overthrow the Clarkston Bantams. The two school combined raised over $8,000 from the spirit week. Over $5,000 came from CHS. Lewiston Morning Tribune Golden Throne Article

Diocese of San Severino

The former Italian Catholic Diocese of San Severino, in the Province of Macerata, Marche in Central Italy, existed until 1986. In that year it was united into the Archdiocese of Camerino to form the Archdiocese of Camerino-San Severino Marche.
History.
San Severino stands on the site of the ancient Septempeda, a city of Picenum. The saint from whom the city takes its name is commonly believed to have been Bishop of Septempeda, but his date is unknown. 
In the eighth century it was a fortress of the Duchy of Spoleto. The Church of San Severino gave its name later to a new town that grew up around it. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it was at constant war with the neighbouring cities, especially with Camerino, and always supported the cause of the emperors, particularly of Emperor Frederick II. Louis the Bavarian named as vicar of San Severino Smeduccio della Scala, who, passing into the service of the Holy See, gave great help to the expedition of Cardinal Albornoz and became feudal lord of San Severino, a post held later by his son Onofrio. 
His nephew Antonio paid with his life for attempting to resist the arms of Pietro Colonna, the representative of Pope Martin V; his sons tried in vain to recapture the city (1434), which remained immediately subject to the Holy See. 
In the Middle Ages San Severino was part of the Archdiocese of Camerino; the old cathedral was then a collegiate church. In 1566 it had a seminary. In 1586 Pope Sixtus V made it an episcopal see, the first bishop being Orazio Marzari. Among his successors were: Angelo Maldacchini, O. P. (1646); Alessandro Calai Organi (1702), the restorer of the seminary; Angelo Antonio Anselmi (1792), exiled in 1809. The diocese became a suffragan of the archdiocese of Fermo.
In 1920 the Diocese of Treia was united into the diocese of San Severino. In the reorganisation of 1985-6 it passed to the Diocese of Macerata-Tolentino-Recanati-Cingoli-Treia.

United States v. Martinez-Fuerte

United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, was a decision of the United States Supreme Court that allowed the United States Border Patrol to set up permanent or fixed checkpoints on public highways leading to or away from the Mexican border, and that these checkpoints are not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
History.
The defendant, Martinez-Fuerte, had agreed to transport two illegal Mexican aliens who had entered the United States through the Port of San Ysidro in San Diego, California. They traveled north and were stopped at a permanent checkpoint on Interstate 5 between Oceanside and San Clemente, then questioned. The two passengers admitted their status and the defendant was charged with two counts of illegally transporting aliens. He moved to have the evidence suppressed, on the grounds that the checkpoint stop had violated the 4th Amendment. The motion was denied and he was convicted of both counts.
Opinion.
The court ruled 7 to 2 that the internal checkpoints were not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but rather were consistent with the amendment. They went on to say that it would be impracticable for the officers to seek warrants for every vehicle searched and that to do so would eliminate any deterrent towards smuggling and illegal immigration. The court felt that any intrusion to motorists was a minimal one and that the government and public interest outweighed the constitutional rights of the individual.
The court also ruled that the stops were Constitutional even if largely based on apparent Mexican ancestry.
However the court added that restrictions still exist: "We have held that checkpoint searches are constitutional only if justified by consent or probable cause to search" (though the court did hold that the probable cause bar was low for permanent checkpoints with limited impact on motorists). The Court also held, "our holding today is limited to the type of stops described in this opinion. -further detention...must be based on consent or probable cause. Our prior cases have limited significantly the reach of this congressional authorization, requiring probable cause for any vehicle search in the interior and reasonable suspicion for inquiry stops by roving patrols [as opposed to permanent checkpoints." 428 U.S. 543, 567 (1976).
Dissent.
Justice William Brennan wrote in his dissent that the decision marks a radical new intrusion on citizens' rights, and that it "empties the reasonableness requirement of the Amendment". He also says:
"The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only when it is assured that at some point the conduct of those charged with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances. And in making that assessment it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard . . . . Anything less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result this Court has consistently refused to sanction."
Part of Justice Brennan's complaint was that this decision was the ninth that had ruled against Fourth Amendment protections that term.

SCALE-UP

SCALE-UP is a learning environment specifically created to facilitate active, collaborative learning in a studio-like setting. Some people think the rooms look more like restaurants than classrooms. The spaces are carefully designed to facilitate interactions between teams of students who work on short, interesting tasks. A decade of research indicates significant improvements in learning. The approach taken during the development and testing of the learning environment is an application of scientific teaching and has been discussed in several books. Although originating at NC State University, more than 200 colleges across the US and around the world have directly adopted the SCALE-UP model and adapted it to their particular needs.
The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The original design called for 11 tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones.
SCALE-UP Adopters.
The main SCALE-UP website has information from nearly 90 of the known adopters of this pedagogical approach. 
SCALE-UP classes are being taught in college-level physics, mathematics, computer science, chemistry, engineering, biology, nursing, business management, astronomy, and even literature. There are also high school courses that utilize this general pedagogy
Non-SCALE-UP Studios.
Beyond the studio-based instruction that is commonly seen for art and dance classes, several universities have developed their own studio-based classrooms independently from the SCALE-UP project. (The well-known TEAL classrooms at MIT are SCALE-UP adaptations.) The Workshop Physics Project at Dickinson College produced some of the earliest studio-based science instruction. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute probably offers more college-level studio courses than anyone else. UC-Davis has been teaching physics in a studio classroom for several years. In 2011, two Wisconsin Collaboratory for Enhanced Learning (WisCEL) Centers (wiki entry) were built at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to focus on flipped and blended learning.

Freddy Kottulinsky

Winfried Philippe Adalbert Karl Graf Kottulinsky Freiherr von Kottulin, better known as Freddy Kottulinsky (20 July 1932 – 4 May 2010), was a German-Swedish racing and rallying driver who won the Paris-Dakar Rally in 1980. He was born in München.
Biography.
A member of old Austrian-Silesian nobility, in 1953 he went to Sweden, where he set up a repair shop. In the 1960s and mostly with a Swedish racing licence, Kottulinsky competed in Formula 3, Formula V and Formula 2. In F3 he became Swedish champion in 1966 on a Lotus 35 Cosworth. Together with Ronnie Peterson and Torsten Palm he in 1970 scored a Swedish win in the F3 European Cup for nations. In 1974 he won Formel Super V's European Gold Cup on a Lola T320.
He also entered rallys, as did his daughter Susanne Kottulinsky who had been born in 1960. In 1980 he won the Paris-Dakar Rally together with Gerd Löffelmann in a 4WD VW Iltis prepared by Audi. When asked for the first time to drive one of three cars that were supposed to support Jean Ragnotti, Kottulinsky, who had neither experience nor desire to race in a desert, declined indirectly by asking for a high salary. Shortly before the race began, the team hired him anyway, and Kottulinsky entered the race with hardly any preparation. He did not have tent nor sleeping bag, but enough spare parts to keep the car running without having to wait for support. The design of this four wheel drive system provided the basis for Audi's Quattro system, which debuted later in 1980 on the original Audi Quattro. In that time, Kottulinsky also trained the mechanics to drive the team's service vehicles quickly and safely. This developed into Audi Fahrsicherheitstraining (driving safety lessons), for which Kottulinsky worked 25 years until retirement.
Kottulinsky lived in Görkwitz in Thüringen for several years, promoting the local race track Schleizer Dreieck. At over 70 years of age, he was still entering motorsport events, e.g. on 11 August 2006 with a Datsun 240Z in the AvD-Historic-Marathon-400 on the Nordschleife of the Nürburgring. He died in May 2010 in Karlstad.

Ivan Milev

Ivan Milev Lalev (; 18 February 189725 January 1927) was a Bulgarian painter and scenographer regarded as the founder of the Bulgarian Secession and a representative of Bulgarian modernism, combining symbolism, Art Nouveau and expressionism in his work.
Ivan Milev was born in the town of Kazanlak in the family of shepherd Milyu Lalev. In 1917-1918, he fought as a soldier in World War I. On 18 November 1918, the same year that he finished high school in his hometown, he arranged an exhibition in Kazanlak. For two years he was a teacher in Gorski Izvor, Haskovo Province. In 1920, he was admitted to the National Academy of Arts in Sofia, where he studied under Prof. Stefan Badzhov, and had three one-man exhibitions. He also contributed to the communist comic magazine "Red Laughter" (Червен смях, "Cherven smyah") as an illustrator and cartoonist.
In the summer of 1923, he visited Turkey, Greece and Italy with a group of fellow students. He was introduced to the achievements of the Italian Renaissance and the Italian Baroque in Rome, Naples, Florence and Venice. In 1926, he graduated in set decoration from the National Academy and worked for the Ivan Vazov National Theatre as a stage designer. Afterwards he became an independent freelance painter and illustrator and he also painted frescoes. With a group of colleagues he took part in the Shipka Memorial design competition, but came second.
Generally living in poverty, Milev had a brief 18-month marriage to opera singer Katya Naumova; their daughter Mariya Mileva eventually became an architect. Milev died of influenza in Sofia on 25 January 1927, shortly before his thirtieth birthday.
Regarded as one of the great masters of distemper and watercolour painting in Bulgarian art, Milev often created socially loaded works. His characteristic decorative style was much influenced by the European Secession, but it was also related to Bulgarian folk art and icon painting. Milev's paintings are exhibited in the National Art Gallery, Sofia Art Gallery, the Shumen, Kazanlak and other cities' galleries.
Milev is portrayed on the obverse of the current 5 Bulgarian leva banknote issued in 1999, with some of his works depicted on the reverse side.

List of Everybody Hates Chris characters

This is a list of the main characters in the Emmy-nominated TV series "Everybody Hates Chris". The fictional family is loosely based on that of the real-life Chris Rock.
Main characters.
NOTE: While the protagonist is clearly based upon Chris Rock, the surname "Rock" is never used when referring to the character Chris or any member of his family.
Chris.
Tyler James Williams as Chris, the ambitious, normal, responsible, kind-hearted, but unlucky, unpopular, untalented, nonathletic, hapless, awkward, nerdy, vulnerable eldest child and main protagonist of the series. He wishes he was more like his younger brother, Drew. Regardless of whether Chris possesses any of these traits, he's certainly never treated as if he does.(being disliked by the opposite gender, unlike his siblings) He tries hard to be well liked by his peers, but often finds himself a victim of circumstance. Chris is bullied at school (with little help from teachers or faculty members), tortured by his sister, shown up by his brother, victimized by the racist teaching staff, gets his money stolen by neighborhood thugs, underpaid at work, receives tough love from his mother, and distressing treatment from his father. As the eldest child, he is often put in charge of his younger siblings, but they usually disobey him. Next to all this, Chris is always the butt of the last jokes on each show. People just seem to hate him for inexplicable reasons. One of his talents is playing Asteroids and the other is calling basketball games. As he gets older, Chris becomes interested in stand-up comedy and begins telling jokes in school.
Julius.
Julius (played by Terry Crews) is Rochelle's cheap, frugal, worrisome, levelheaded husband and the father of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. He is known for his extreme cheapness and taking the easy way out when it comes to purchasing essential items for his family (such as by using food-stamps and buying store-brands). Julius' cheapness is also exhibited by how he uses duct tape to fix everything and anything broken in the house. He even has been shown to memorize the price of nearly every object in his family's possession and shouting it out loud when such an item has been wasted or ruined, and one of his most famous character attributes is bargaining his way out of having to pay the full price for something. He coddles Tonya and is more likely than his wife to give her what she wants, and will react with a lecture every time one of his children considers quitting or asks him about receiving money, such lectures having been known to last for hours on end and encouraging his kids to avoid bringing up such subjects around him. It is implied that Julius can understand Chinese but could not speak it due to the fact when he communicates with Mr. Fong who speaks Chinese towards him, he is able to respond back. Whenever Chris has a problem, he goes to Julius, who gives him advice in a confusing manner (once Chris remarked that even though he didn't understand what his father said, however, it made him feel better anyway).
Rochelle.
Rochelle (played by Tichina Arnold) is Julius' strict, humorously sassy wife and is the mother of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. She is a loudmouthed woman who frequently becomes paranoid over things that often have nothing to do with the current subject matter (such as Tonya becoming pregnant or her kids selling drugs). She is noted for the saucy comebacks that she uses to put a stop to any complaints that her children might have or to ensure that they do not attempt to perform a crime or great misdeed of some sort, and fears that they may wind up as street criminals. In spite of her frank behavior, she does share loving moments with her children, showing that her true intentions for her ways are sincerely because she cares for her children. She also has a passion for chocolate Turtles, which often pacify her, and experiences symptoms of withdrawal whenever she must sacrifice them for whatever reason.
Drew.
Drew (played by Tequan Richmond) is Chris's popular, lucky, talented, athletic, handsome younger brother. As opposed to the malicious rejection and harassment Chris receives from his peers, Drew is idolized above all of his classmates, and his supreme charm has earned him a multitude of girlfriends in the past. Secretly, Chris envies the limitless amount of luck and talent possessed by his younger brother, who appears slightly older than he does, and so Drew's height as opposed to that of Chris provides his elder brother with a number of disadvantages. Ironically, Drew himself looks up to Chris and envies all the responsibility and trust their parents give him. Highly athletic, Drew loves hockey and idolizes Wayne Gretzky. He is also shown to be interested in magic and karate. Drew also has the talent of copying things he sees off of television, especially karate movies.
"Wasn't Me" Is a familiar catchphrase of his, often to get himself out of any possible trouble he is sure he had nothing to do with. This was first introduced in the Pilot episode.
Tonya.
Imani Hakim as Tonya, Chris and Drew's younger sister. She is a smart-mouthed, and manipulative little girl who enjoys getting her brothers (mostly Chris) in trouble by whining to her parents about things they never actually did, and Julius and Rochelle always believe her. However, in the third and fourth seasons, she tends to hold a soft spot for Drew and Chris (when Chris got thrown out of the house, she admitted she doesn't want him gone and she and Drew try to rethink Chris's and her mother's decisions) by charging money to keep her mouth shut if they do something wrong (particularly to Chris), and repeatedly sometimes hangs around Drew. Billy Ocean is her favorite entertainer (though later on she adopts a fondness for Danny Glover), and telling by the way Tonya believes that he originally was responsible for the invention of the Moonwalk instead of Michael Jackson, she might not like to believe what she does not want to believe. Julius over-indulges Tonya and is usually the parent apt to give her what she wants, whereas Rochelle is normally not afraid to not provide Tonya with one of her desires if it is for something she is unwilling to give to her daughter, and worries that one mistake in raising her will be linked to her being pregnant one day, and "She ain't raisin' no babies". It seems that she is very attractive, and is usually given nice gifts from the neighborhoood kids; for example, James (one of her admirers) bought her a car in one episode.
Greg.
Vincent Martella as Gregory "Greg" Wuliger, (b. 1970) Chris's weird, nerdy, and anxious best friend. He is the only kid at Corleone Junior High who doesn't hate Chris. He is as unpopular as Chris, if not more so. Chris always comes to Greg for advice, even though Greg is usually terrible at coming up with solutions. On top of being a good student, Greg also has a series of odd quirks (such as going to bed dressed as different superheroes), but considers himself cool. He has a book about almost everything in his locker. He is an only child and is of Italian and Swedish descent. His mom married his dad because she lost a bet but ran off with his uncle Patrick Wuliger, who later had a gender change. After graduating from Corleone, Greg went to a different high school than Chris in Season 4, but got kicked out due to poor grades when he tried to portray a more tough image. He transferred to the same high school that Chris attends and the two continue their friendship. Even though his father was seen in one episode his mother is never actually seen. Greg's catch phrase is "You're so in there". He was absent from only two episodes in the entire series.
The Narrator.
Chris Rock as The Narrator (voice), a sarcastic older Chris looking back at his youth, like that of "The Wonder Years". His narration is usually the opposite of what his younger self says, but is actually thinking. The Narrator also mentions his disdain for George W. Bush as he frequently says sarcastic things about him. For instance in one episode the narrator talks how Greg has gone from bad to worse like "America under Bush".

Martin Brem (born 1959), also known by his stage name Marty Brem, is an Austrian-born former singer, record executive and entrepreneur currently active in Berlin. He is known to wider audiences for his participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, representing Austria in 1980 as a member of the band Blue Danube and as a soloist in 1981, singing "Wenn Du Da Bist" amidst somewhat unusual choreography performed by female dancers in an equally unusual selection of costumes.
After Brem's Eurovision exploits, he undertook various musical ventures, which included new wave and punk music. Brem also became a music journalist, and joined Philip Morris as a marketing consultant 1988, only to return to the music industry in 1992 as marketing director for Phonogram/Universal. In 1995 Brem became Vice President International Marketing for Sony Music Entertainment Europe in London, and in 1997 he took helm at Columbia Records in Berlin.

Enola Yard

Enola Yard is a large rail yard located in East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania, along the western shore of the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was the world's largest freight yard through 1956. The yard continues to operate today at lower traffic levels.
History.
The yard was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1905 with two hump classification yards. Initially the yard processed 7,000 cars per day. The westbound complex had a receiving yard with 20 tracks, and a 25-track classification yard. The eastbound complex had a 21-track receiving yard and 17 classification tracks. There were no separate departure yards.
Enola Yard was fully built out by the late 1920s, encompassing 316 acres and a capacity of 9,692 cars. Service buildings included a 43-stall roundhouse and a steel car shop. A yard to handle container freight was added to the complex in 1932.
The PRR rebuilt the component yards and installed automatic retarders, starting with the eastbound hump in 1938. The eastbound yard was electrified with 11,000-volt alternating current (AC) service. ("See" Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system.) The westbound complex was rebuilt in 1944 with 16 receiving tracks and 35 classification tracks, followed by the eastbound complex, reconfiguring to 15 receiving tracks and 33 classification tracks. The average daily traffic load in 1939 was 11,207 cars, and this average increased during the approach of World War II, with 14,100 daily cars in October 1941. The record traffic level at the yard was 20,660 cars in one day during June 1943.
Adolf Hitler's first invasion plan for the United States was of Enola, PA because of the Enola Yard. If he had invaded Enola, the eastern seaboard would be shut down because at the time, the Enola Yard was the largest railyard in the world at the time.
A diesel locomotive shop was added in the late 1940s. In 1953 the yard handled 11,000 cars per day, and the yard comprised 145 miles of track and 476 switches. In the 1950s PRR rebuilt Conway Yard near Pittsburgh, and upon its opening in 1959, Conway became the railroad's major yard for east-west traffic. Traffic at Enola Yard was reduced.
Conrail took over operation of Enola Yard in 1976. Traffic levels at the yard declined as more trains were routed by Conrail over nearby tracks of the former Reading and Lehigh Valley rail lines. Conrail removed electrification equipment and closed the eastbound hump yard in 1983, and closed the westbound hump yard in 1993. The steel car shop closed in 1996.
Current operation.
The yard is currently owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), which has operated a flat classification yard and increased operations since taking over from Conrail in 1999. In 2003 NS announced plans to resume hump yard operations. As of 2005, the yard was operating 79 tracks and handled 275,000 tons of freight a day.

Holochroal eye

Holochroal eyes are compound eyes with many tiny lenses (sometimes more than 15,000, each 30-100μm, rarely larger). They are the oldest and most widespread type of trilobite eye, and found in all orders of trilobite from the Cambrian to the Permian periods. Lenses show hexagonal close packing, and a single corneal membrane covered all lenses. Unlike most modern arthropods, these eyes were not covered by the white layer known as the sclera.

In the late 1890s, he bought the Grundie Hotel in Springfield, Missouri, which he operated until about 1904. In the early 1900s, his family moved to Long Beach, California, where he lived for the rest of his life.
Ward published the book, " 'The Master Key' to the Problems of Passion Week and the Resurrection According to the Scriptures" in 1915.
His first wife, Emma, died on September 9, 1916, in Long Beach. He married Minnie Zurada Souder between Emma's death and 1920.
He is interred at Sunnyside Cemetery in Long Beach, California.
Military service.
Ward enlisted in the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry on August 5, 1861, and eventually attained the rank of Quartermaster Sergeant in that regiment. He received the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Staunton River Bridge on June 25, 1864. Ward led a charge from land without meaningful cover onto a railroad bridge that was secured on both sides by confederate troops. Although his commanding officer had been killed, he led a successful assault of the bridge despite the Union forces suffering heavy casualties.
Medal of Honor citation.
Citation:

Alexander Anstruther

Alexander William Anstruther (3 October 1846 – 18 October 1902) was an Indian-born English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman who played first-class cricket for Marylebone Cricket Club and Sussex. He was born in Rajahmundry and died in Wormit.
Anstruther made his debut in the 1873 season, playing for the MCC, though it wasn't until almost exactly a year later he made his next first-class appearance. Anstruther made six appearances for the MCC in total, before moving to play with Sussex.
Anstruther made his first appearance for Sussex in 1878, playing as captain and making the highest score of his debut Sussex innings. However, his team lost the match by an innings margin. He played four further games for the team that season, though his Sussex team failed to win a single one.
Following this, Anstruther played in just two first-class matches, both for the MCC, the first in 1880, and the final one seven years later.
Anstruther's nephew, Robert Anstruther, played one first-class match in the 1910-11 season.

Wye Valley Railway

The Wye Valley Railway (abbreviated WVR) was a standard gauge railway that ran for nearly between Chepstow and Monmouth along the lower part of the scenic Wye Valley in Monmouthshire, Wales, and Gloucestershire, England. It followed the route of the River Wye for most of its length. The line opened on 1 November 1876 as an independent company but was financially unsuccessful and amalgamated with the Great Western Railway in 1905. The GWR ran the line until the Transport Act 1947, which nationalised the railways of Britain. From then, it was operated by British Rail until its closure to goods traffic in 1964; passenger traffic was withdrawn before that date on 5 January 1959. The southern section of the railway between Tintern Quarry and Wye Valley Junction remained open until 1981, when operation was then cut back to Dayhouse Quarry, (near Tidenham Station). This remained used for quarry traffic until the early 1990s.
History.
The line was inaugurated by an Act of Parliament in 1866, although construction was delayed until 1874 because of national economic circumstances. These events were caused by the collapse of the well known firm Overend and Gurney in 1866 due to many railway companies taking out loans and not paying them back. The business was in a debt of 11 million pounds when it collapsed (equivalent to £828 million in 2003).
The southern part of the line, between Chepstow and Tintern, was particularly complex in engineering terms, requiring a long tunnel of 1188 yards at Tidenham, a stretch along a steep hillside above the River Wye, and a second short tunnel and bridge at Tintern. Evangelical services were organised during the construction of the line at Woodcroft and Tidenham, partly in an attempt to combat drunkenness among the labourers building the railway. North of Tintern the line followed the valley bottom, with a bridge over the river at Penallt. Outside Monmouth, the line used an existing viaduct across the river which had been built in 1861 by engineer Joseph Firbank to carry the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway. On 18 November 1875, during the construction of the line, a landslide occurred near Redbrook, the event was reported in one of the columns in the next days Times, this event led to serious doubts about the railway's future.
The railway was opened on 1 November 1876, from Wye Valley Junction near Chepstow, on the main line between Gloucester and Newport, to Monmouth Troy which was then one of Monmouth's two stations. Here passengers could change for Pontypool (along the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway), Ross-on-Wye (along the Ross and Monmouth Railway) and Coleford (along the Coleford Railway). Trains stopped at the intervening stations on the line, Tidenham, Tintern, Bigsweir (later renamed St Briavels), and Redbrook as well as Chepstow, Tutshill Halt for Beachley and Monmouth Troy which were constructed by different companies. Tintern Station was the largest station after Monmouth Troy Station; it had an island platform in the centre of the station.
The line was intended to serve both tourist traffic and freight, such as those visiting Tintern Abbey, and also the limestone quarries, paper mills and metal works in the Wye Valley. Although constructed by the Wye Valley Railway Company, the line was operated from the outset by the Great Western Railway. It was not financially successful, and in 1905 the Wye Valley Railway Company was bought by the GWR. The Wye Valley Railway had been bankrupt more than once during its short life as an independent company and GWR's purchase of the line may well have been inevitable. The GWR added several halts along the line, at Netherhope Halt (1932), Brockweir Halt (1929), Llandogo (1927), Whitebrook Halt (1927), Penallt Halt (1931), and Wyesham (1931). Penallt Halt and Redbrook Station became the closest stations on the line with only a viaduct over the River Wye separating them.
In the inter-war period, there were about five trains in each direction each day, and popular excursion trains were also run to Tintern, particularly to see the harvest moon through the abbey windows. Redbrook Station became nationally noted for its floral displays. However, after a long decline in revenue associated with the growth of motor traffic, the line closed to passengers in 1959, four years before the national Beeching cuts. The last ever passenger train was a special service run by the Stephenson Locomotive Society. It was hauled by two GWR Pannier Tanks, class 6400. They were numbers 6439 and 6412 (see Today's Remnants). The train ran all the way along the branch from Chepstow to Monmouth, from there it ran along the Ross and Monmouth Railway (which was also closed at the same time), to Ross-on-Wye. The special service was the only known train to make the route in one single journey. The railway closed to general goods traffic between Monmouth and Tintern Quarry on 6th January 1964. Several railtours ran by enthusiasts were held through Tidenham tunnel in the 1970s, one of the last of these in 1978, the "Tintern Totter" was hauled by a Class 20: D8098. The engine has survived into preservation and is owned by the Type One Locomotive Company. The section to Tintern Quarry closed in 1981, there were three special services to the site of Tidenham Station in the 1980s, then the rest of the line was abandoned when Tidenham Quarry closed in the 1990s.
Route and Stations.
The branch started at Chepstow station on the west side of the River Wye. It followed the route of the South Wales Railway (now Gloucester to Newport Line) over the River Wye on the Chepstow Railway Bridge to Tutshill Halt a small request stop serving the village of Tutshill. The WVR left the main line at the Wye Valley Junction and headed up on an embankment to Tidenham, the first station on the line. It was also the first station on the line to be closed, temporarily to release staff during World War I; it was then re-opened in 1918. Tidenham station remained open until the closure of the line to passenger services in 1959, by which time it had been demoted to a halt.
Just outside the south portal of Tidenham tunnel was Netherhope Halt this was the last halt to be constructed on the line before it was closed to passenger services in 1959. The line then headed into Tidenham tunnel (1190 yards) - the twenty-first longest tunnel on the Great Western Railway at its time. The line ran along the east side of the Wye, passing Tintern Quarry. It then went through the smaller Tintern tunnel, (182 yards) and crossed back to the west bank of the River Wye before coming to Tintern Station.
Tintern was the largest station on the line. This was because the Wye Valley Railway Company hoped to generate much income via the tourists visiting the famous Tintern Abbey. The line came to Brockweir Halt, followed by Llandogo Halt which was the smallest stop on the whole railway. The railway followed the course of the west bank of the River Wye to St Briavels Station which was named Bigsweir station upon opening and renamed St Briavels & Llandogo in 1909 and then simply St Briavels from 1927 in anticipation of the opening of Llandogo Halt.
Journeying along the line the train would come to Whitebrook Halt, then Penallt Halt. Penallt Viaduct carried the railway over the River Wye again and onto the east side of the river before reaching Redbrook on Wye Station. This station won numerous prizes for its flower displays and became renown throughout the valley. Wyesham Halt was the last stop before Monmouth Troy. The section between Wyesham and Monmouth involved crossing the Wye one last time by a large viaduct that was built by the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway in 1857 as part of their plans to expand into the Forest of Dean and to Coleford. Monmouth Troy Station was also constructed by the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway.
Monmouth Troy was on the west bank of the river and consisted of two platforms, a typical GWR footbridge, station building, separate cafe building and a large goods yard. It was here that the Wye Valley Railway met the Ross and Monmouth Railway and Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway
All of the original stations on the line, Tidenham, Tintern, St Briavels and Redbrook had some kind of loop for trains to pass each other. Tintern, St Briavels and Redbrook stations were the only stations apart from Monmouth Troy and Chepstow to have facilities for unloading freight trains.
Branches.
Tintern Wireworks Branch.
Tintern Wireworks Branch was a short lived line built across the River Wye to the wireworks at the village of Tintern. It was opened in 1874 although it was officially opened in 1876 due to the fact that the branch was completed before the Wye Valley Line which it branched off from. The short line became known as the Wireworks Branch even though by the time the branch had opened the wireworks it was meant to serve had gone out of business. It struggled on until 1935 when the rails buckled in the heat of summer. The tracks remained mostly dormant until 1941 when they were sent for use on the railways of the Western Front of World War II, but were sunk in transit across the English Channel.
Coleford Railway.
The Coleford Railway was a branch line which ran between Coleford and Monmouth. It was opened in 1883 and became the fourth and final line to reach the town of Monmouth. The railway closed on New Year's Day 1917, partly due to wartime economy measures and partly because it was losing money - it never reached the hopes of its constructors. It joined the Wye Valley Line at Wyesham Junction and both railways ran along the same line for a short stretch until they both arrived at their joint terminus, Monmouth Troy. The tracks was ripped up between Wyesham Junction and Whitecliff Quarry soon after closure, however the short stretch between Whitecliff Quarry and Coleford remained open until 1976 for freight traffic. The operation of this section was passed to the Severn and Wye Railway. The goods shed was converted into a museum (the Coleford Great Western Railway Museum) on the railways of the Forest of Dean and the Great Western Railway.
Today's Remnants.
Many things remain of the WVR. The rails between Wye Valley Junction and the north portal of Tidenham tunnel are largely intact, but the rails have been lifted for the remainder of track. Three former railway bridges across the River Wye are still standing, Penallt Viaduct, which now carries a footpath between Redbrook and Penallt, the Wireworks Branch bridge, also a footpath and the impressive 21 - arch viaduct at Monmouth, which carried the railway over the river, is still in place though the central metal section has been removed and it is inaccessible to pedestrians. The station building and goods shed at St Briavels Station are still mainly intact.
Tintern Station has been renamed 'The Old Station Tintern' and is now a popular picnic site and base for short walks with a permanent exhibition of the history of the line. The Wye Valley Walk passes through the site and paved footpaths extend to nearby Tintern and Brockweir. It won the Green Flag Award in 2009. In 2010, the old carriages were replaced with new refurbished ones, which now hold the 'Destination Wye Valley' exhibition as part of the £2.8m Heritage Lottery funded 'Overlooking the Wye Scheme' which is conserving various sites within the lower Wye Valley.
Monmouth Troy Station was removed from Monmouth and re-built brick by brick along the restored Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway and is now known as Winchcombe railway station.
Pannier Tank 6412, the engine that pulled the last passenger service along the line on the 4th January 1959, was preserved on the West Somerset Railway between 1976–2009 and was purchased by the South Devon Railway in January 2009. It has also starred in the children's TV series The Flockton Flyer.
Proposed Uses and Cycle Path.
Sustrans, which owns the track bed between Chepstow and Tintern, has announced plans to turn the route into a cycleway, reopening the tunnels at Tidenham and Tintern and constructing a bridge over the River Wye near Tintern Station. Public consultations on the proposals took place during 2009, with a view to Sustrans re-submitting proposals for "a traffic-free path for walkers, cyclists, people with disabilities and horse riders" for planning approval later in the year. A consultation report was subsequently published by Sustrans. The proposal is to create a path between Brockweir and Sedbury, mostly using the abandoned railway track bed. Almost all the entire length of the old line is within the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The campaign has been met with mixed reactions from the local community. A large number of locals support the plans, and this is reflected in the public comments on the Forest of Dean planning website, but there is also a committee of locals who strongly oppose the path proposal. The Forest of Dean District Council approved the plans on 9 November 2010. The route would form part of National Cycle Route 42.
In the 1970s an association was formed to collect materials for re-opening the line as a heritage railway, the whereabouts of this group is unknown.
A group also exists to promote the reopening of the line as a modern railway with electric services, they have a website with information about the line's history and evaluations about re-opening the line fully to Monmouth Troy.

Hockey career.
He began his career as a scout for the Boston Bruins,and was promoted to chief scout and director of player personnel. In 1971, Young was hired by Charlie Finley as the California Golden Seals' new General Manager, replacing interim Fred Glover. He named himself coach after he dismissed Vic Stasiuk in the 1972 off-season. He was fired 12 games into the 1972–73 NHL season in light of irregularities surrounding Dick Redmond's contract. He created several copies of the contract with different amounts of compensation for Redmond's services on each. Finley rectified the situation by having Redmond traded to the Chicago Black Hawks and firing Young. Fred Glover was named Young's replacement.
Young was hired by the NHL brass as General Manager of the Golden Seals again in February 1974 after Glover resigned. Young's term was again short-lived: he resigned prior to the beginning of the following season. He joined the St. Louis Blues as their head coach later that year, lasting there for parts of two seasons.
He later coached the Peterborough Petes for a single season. 
Personal information.
Young had four children with his wife Verna; Steven, Michael, Linda and Paul. Young drowned in a boating accident in 1994. He is buried in Orono, Ontario. Young's grandfather was Weldy Young, an early ice hockey player with the Ottawa Hockey Club in the 1890s.

Armenians in Samtskhe-Javakheti

Armenians in Samtskhe-Javakheti are ethnic Armenians of Georgian nationality living in the Samtskhe-Javakheti region of the Republic of Georgia. The southern part of the region (Javakheti) borders the Republic of Armenia to the south. Here, ethnic Armenians form the great majority of the population with minorities of Georgians, Russians and Greeks. Among Armenians of Samtskhe-Javakheti, Armenian is the common language spoken.
History.
Many of the Armenians in the region immigrated from the province of Erzerum in the Ottoman Empire after the area became part of Russia in 1829 while most of the Muslims (Meskhetian Turks and Adjaris) in the region emigrated to the Ottoman Empire. 
More Armenians came to region later on as a result of Turkish massacres and the Armenian genocide.
Ethnic Armenians are chiefly concentrated in Akhalkalaki and Ninotsminda districts. At the beginning of 1918 in Akhalkalaki region had 120,000 population, from which Armenians were 89,000 (74%), Meskhetian Turks were 8,000 (7%), representatives of other nationalities 23,000 (19%) During this period in Ahalkalak district there were 111 villages from which 66 were Armenian, 24 Turkish, 9 Russian, 10 Georgian (including former Armenian villages Vargav and Hzabavra, the population of which had assimilated with Georgians), and one village with the Armenian-Georgian mixed population. 
In 1944 the government of the Soviet Union decided to exile the Meskhetian Turkish population living in Meskheti (approximately 100,000 person) to Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan). The five villages of Sagamo, Khavet, Erindja, Davnia, and Karsep in the Akhalkalaki district and the Bogdanovka areas were settled by Armenians.
During Zviad Gamsakhurdia's presidency (1991), Javakheti remained "de facto" semi-independent and only in November 1991 the Tbilisi-appointed governor was able to take power. The issue of Javakheti was in the 1990s "clearly been perceived as the most dangerous potential ethnic conflict in Georgia", however, no actual armed conflict ever occurred. 
An incident took place in Akhalkalaki district on August 14, 1998. The Georgian military units were to hold exercises with the Russians in Akhalkalaki, while the local Armenian population was uninformed about it. The Georgians units entered the Armenian-populated areas and met some 25 Armenians, who "believed that the Georgian army was coming to deport Armenians from their homes". The group of Armenians were armed and allegedly had mortars and other artillery. The Georgian units eventually left, avoiding a possible clash with the armed men. According to the Georgian national security ministry was the incident was a provocation organized by the Javakhk organization. 
Vahagn Chakhalyan, the leader of United Javakhk, was arrested in 2008. Chakhalyan was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in 2009 for "acquisition and possession of firearms and ammunition, organizing a group action which grossly disrupted public order, hooliganism committed against a government representative." Chakhalyan was released from prison in January 2013 under amnesty law after Bidzina Ivanishvili and his Georgia Dream coalition came to power in Georgia. It is expected that his release and the power change in Tbilisi will reduce the existing tension in the area.
Demographics.
This table is a comparing table of Armenian population of Samtskhe-Javakheti in 1939, 1989, 2002.
Politics.
Tensions in Samtskhe-Javakheti have run high at times. One reason is based in the official Georgian language policy that does, officially, not allow the Armenian language to be used in public or administrative offices, even if citizen and officer speak better Armenian than Georgian. International monitoring missions on the situation of national minorities in Georgia have critically commented in this aspect as recently as 2009. 
The ethnic Armenian United Javakhk Democratic Alliance calls on a local autonomy for Javakheti within Georgia. 
Some Armenian political groupings of the Republic of Armenia and the Armenian diaspora, amongst them most notably the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) claim that Javakhk (Armenian name for Javakheti) should belong to Armenia, United Armenia shall include all territories designated as Armenia by the Treaty of Sèvres as well as the regions of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), Javakhk (Armenian name for Javakheti), and Nakhchivan. However, Javakhk (Javakheti) is not officially claimed by the government of Armenia.
A small number of Turkish Meskhetians returned to Georgia in recent years. With little employment opportunities in the region, the re-migration caused tensions with the local Armenian population. In consequence, the Georgian authorities preferred to settle returning Turkish Meskhetians in other areas in the country.
The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan oil pipeline and South Caucasus gas pipeline which passed through the region, has met opposition from local Armenians, as well as the planned Kars-Akhalkalaki-Baku railway as it isolates Armenia.

Lexington and Ohio Railroad

The Lexington and Ohio Railroad was the first railroad in the U.S. state of Kentucky. Its charter proposed the establishment of a link between Lexington in the center of the Bluegrass Region to the river port of Louisville at the Falls of the Ohio by way of Frankfort, the state capital. The line was never completed and the Panic of 1837 led to its complete collapse. The Commonwealth seized the railroad in payment of its debts in 1840.
The rights-of-way of the former L&O were later purchased and utilized by the Louisville & Frankfort and Lexington & Frankfort railroads, which subsequently merged into the Louisville, Cincinnati, & Lexington.

Pizzolungo bombing

The Pizzolungo Bombing was a car-bomb attack on April 2, 1985, undertaken by the mafia in order to kill Carlo Palermo, a magistrate in Pizzolungo, Sicily. Palermo had been investigating an international drug and arms trafficking network in which Italian politicians may have been involved. Palermo was injured in the attack and three passersby were killed: Barbara Rizzo Asta and her young twin sons, Salvatore and Giuseppe.
Attack.
On the morning of April 2, 1985, a car bomb loaded with TNT exploded on the side of the highway through Pizzolungo. It was set to detonate as deputy prosecutor Carlo Palermo traveled from his house in Bonagia to the Palace of Justice in Trapani in an armored Fiat 132 followed by an unarmored Fiat Ritmo. Just before the bomb exploded, Palermo's car was overtaken by a Volkswagen Sirocco, driven by Barbara Rizzo Asta, 30, who was taking her six-year-old twins Giuseppe and Salvatore, to school. Her vehicle was caught between the car bomb and the Fiat 132. The explosion was heard miles away.
Palermo was wounded, but the Sirocco bore the brunt of the blast, killing its occupants. Asta was thrown out of the car while the bodies of the children were scattered much further away. One body landed on the wall of a building 200 yards (180 meters) away, mangled beyond recognition. Among the first responders were the woman's husband, Nunzio Asta, and his brother. But her vehicle was destroyed to such an extent that Nunzio and his brother did not suspect that the family was involved in the explosion. After the arrival of the police and emergency services, Nunzio went home, and then left by car to go to his workshop. Shortly after, the police called to ask for the license plate number of the car and Nunzio found out that one of his employees had already discovered his children had never reached school.
Of the four bodyguards in the rear Fiat car, two were slightly injured while the other two were severely hit by shrapnel: Anthony Ruggiero was hit in the eye, while Salvatore La Porta was hit in the head and other parts of his body.
Aftermath.
The prosecutor on the case was Sebastiano Patanè.
Among the survivors, Raffaele Di Mercurio, 36-years-old at the time of the massacre, died in 1993 due to heart disease. In the same year, because of heart problems, Nunzio Asta died (at the time of the attack he had already undergone heart-bypass surgery). His oldest daughter Margaret became active as an adult in the anti-mafia movement "Free" in the province of Trapani.
Gioacchino Calabrò was charged with terrorism and conspiring with others to commit a massacre for the attack. But the charges were quashed in 1991 after judges ruled the defendants would not have committed the crime. Among those judges were Corrado Carnevale.
In 2004, the Mafiosi Balduccio Di Maggio, Vincenzo Virga and Totò Riina were convicted for ordering the massacre.
Memorial.
A memorial has been constructed at the site of the attack. A quote on the monument reads:
Following a national competition won by the group Lg = mC (Giovanni Lucentini, Marcello Calà), work began in April 2011 on the construction of a memorial park at the site of the attack.

Louisville and Frankfort Railroad

The Louisville and Frankfort Railroad (L&F) was a 19th-century railroad in the U.S. state of Kentucky.
Following the 1840 failure of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, which had only ever managed to connect Louisville with nearby Portland, area businessmen met for years before organizing a new railroad in March 1847. The Louisville and Frankfort was chartered to connect the Ohio port to the state capital, as well as Lexington with any points east. The stretch between the capital and Lexington itself was left for the Lexington and Frankfort, chartered the next year.
After purchasing the L&O's rights-of-way west from Frankfort from the Commonwealth, the Louisville and Frankfort issued stock and raised $800,000 from the City of Louisville. Surveys directed by Col. Stephen H. Long of the U.S. Topographical Engineers selected a new route, employing some but not all of the stretches previously graded by the Lexington and Ohio. The rails for the road were purchased in London, England, and shipped upriver from New Orleans. Construction began in March 1849, heading east from Louisville. The one-story brick passenger station, train shed, freight shed, and roundhouse were all located at Brook and Jefferson Streets. Near Cherokee Gardens in Louisville, the line ran adjacent to present-day Frankfort Avenue. On February 6, 1850, the company held a special round trip to LaGrange for the board of directors and their guests. All the initial track was laid by the spring of 1851 and the completion of a bridge over the Kentucky River near Frankfort permitted the first service along the entire mainline in August.
In 1852, the L&F was connected to the completed Lexington and Frankfort mainline and initiated twice-daily service to Lexington. Connection there to the Covington and Lexington Railroad then permitted travel to Cincinnati's Kentucky suburbs. The L&F and Lexington and Frankfort merged their management and operations on January 1, 1857, and then fully merged as the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Lexington Railroad in 1867.
The LC&L later made up part of the L&N. Its rights of way now make up part of the CSX Transportation network.
Directors.
The L&F's first president was Thomas Smith of New Castle (d. 1850). He was succeeded by James Guthrie of Louisville.
The L&F's first board of directors included Smith, John J. Jacob, William F. Field, John Hulme, Virgil McKnight, and Jacob Swigert.

The Jamyang Shêpas (also Jamyang Zhepa, Jamyang-zhaypa, etc.) are a lineage of tülkus, said to be reincarnated Tibetan Buddhist teachers. They have traditional been the most prestigious teachers at Labrang Tashikhyil monastery in Amdo, the far eastern part of the Tibetan region (now in the Chinese province of Gansu).
The first Jamyang Shêpa, Ngawang Tsöndrü (1648–1721), was a native of Amdo, and, after studying at Drepung Monastery near Lhasa, was invited by the local Mongol king to return and teach Buddhism there. There, Ngawang Tsöndrü later founded Labrang Tashikyil, one of the two great monasteries of Amdo. The first Jamyang Shêpa having been educated at Drepung, the lineage has subsequently belonged the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism.
The current Jamyang Shêpa is the 6th, Lobsang Jigme Thubten Chökyi Nyima (born 1948). During the Cultural Revolution, he became a layman and married (Tibetan Buddhist teachers may be either laypersons or monks, but the Jamyang Shêpas are traditionally monks). He currently lives in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province.

Condor-class sloop

The "Condor" class was a six-ship class of 10-gun screw steel sloops built for the Royal Navy between 1898 and 1900. "Condor" foundered in a gale, prompting the Royal Navy to abandon sailing rigs for its ships. The last of the class, "Mutine", survived until 1932 as a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve drill ship.
Design.
The "Condor" class was constructed of steel to a design by William White, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction. They were powered by a three-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engine developing and driving twin screws. 
Sail plan.
The class was originally designed and built with barque-rigged sails, although some pictures show ships of the class with a barquentine rig. "Condor" was lost in a gale during her first commission, and the contemporary gunnery pioneer Admiral Percy Scott ascribes her sinking to the encumbrance of sails, and furthermore believed that her loss finally convinced that Admiralty to abandon sails entirely. All other ships of the class had their sails removed during the first few years of the twentieth century.
Armament.
The class was armed with six 4-inch/25-pounder (1 ton) quick-firing breech loaders and four 3-pounder quick-firing breech loaders.
Operational lives.
The design of the "Condor" class differed from the screw sloops of the 1860s only in an evolutionary sense (although constructed of steel and armed with quick-loading guns, they retained the sails and layout of the earlier vessels); by the turn of the twentieth century they were thoroughly obsolete. The overseas stations of the Royal Navy were responsible for patrolling the maritime British Empire, and these ships were intended for that role. The rapidity with which they were converted to depot ships, training ships or survey ships gives testament to their outmoded design. According to "Hansard", it was stated by the Secretary to the Admiralty about the almost identical "Cadmus" class in Parliament on 6 March 1905 that 
HMS "Condor".
During her short career, "Condor" served on the Pacific Station. On 3 December 1901 while on passage from Esquimalt to Hawaii she foundered in a gale off Vancouver Island (position approximately ). Her last contact was with the light station on Cape Flattery. All hands (130 ship's company and 10 supernumeries) were lost. The tragedy occurred during her first commission and less than three years after her launch. In May 1949 the trawler "Blanco" hauled up wreckage from a depth of The wreckage included a ship's binnacle matching that supplied to "Condor".
HMS "Rosario".
"Rosario" relieved HMS "Rattler" on the China Station in June 1900, and re-commissioned at Hong Kong on 5 November 1913, becoming a depot ship for submarines. She was sold at Hong Kong in December 1921.
HMS "Mutine".
While being delivered from Birkenhead to Portsmouth an accident in "Mutine's" boiler rooms caused some loss of life and gave her a name as an unlucky ship before her career even began. She served on the China Station and became a survey ship, surviving until 1932 as an Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve drill ship, the last of her class to be sold.
HMS "Rinaldo".
"Rinaldo" served in South-East Asia, including taking medical assistance to Brunei in August 1904 during an outbreak of smallpox. By 1914 she was tender and training ship to HMS "Vivid", Devonport Royal Naval Reserve. 
She then saw service in West, South and East Africa until the end of WW1. She was sold for breaking in October 1921.
HMS "Shearwater".
"Shearwater" served on the Pacific Station. She recommissioned on 27 November 1912 at Esquimalt. She was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as a submarine depot ship in 1915, sold to Western Shipping Co, Canada in May 1922 and renamed "Vedas".
HMS "Vestal".
"Vestal" served on the China Station, later becoming training ship and tender to HMS "Excellent", Portsmouth. She was sold for breaking on the same day as "Rinaldo".

Jack Liebowitz

Jacob S. "Jack" Liebowitz (October 10, 1900 – December 11, 2000) was an American accountant and publisher, known primarily as the co-owner with Harry Donenfeld of National Allied Publications (later DC Comics).
Early life.
Jack Liebowitz was born "Yakov" in Proskurov, present-day Ukraine in October 1900, to a Jewish family. His mother, Mindl, never identified his biological father, her first husband (who had left the family), but married Yulyus Lebovitz when her son was three. Yakov soon adopted his stepfather's surname, and in 1910 the family emigrated to the United States. They arrived in the Jewish neighborhood of New York's Lower East Side and, as was common at the time, adopted Anglicized names: His parents became Julius and Minnie Liebowitz, while he became Jacob, soon shortened to Jack. Jack was a hardworking child and became a newsboy amongst other small jobs. In high school, he became adept at accountancy, a career he thought would help him escape his poor background.
Career and partnership with Harry Donenfeld.
By age 24, Liebowitz had earned his accounting degree from New York University, and by 1927 had married (Rose) and moved to The Bronx. Liebowitz set himself up as an accountant based in Manhattan's Union Square area, with one client, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU); his father had been a steward for that union since the early 1910s. By 1925, Liebowitz was in charge of the union's strike fund, and a year later managed to keep the fund solvent in the wake of a six-month, 50,000-worker strike. His business acumen placed Liebowitz in a position of high standing with the union officials. Toward the end of the decade, Liebowitz had taken on more clients and begun studying the stock market. His initial dealings worked well for the union, but after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, funds plummeted and Liebowitz and the ILGWU parted company. 
In 1929, Julius Liebowitz approached Harry Donenfeld, whom he had befriended through ILGWU ties, and sought work for his son. Donenfeld, a rising businessperson who felt a sense of loyalty to those from the old neighborhood, took Jack on as his personal accountant. Although a chance meeting, the two men complemented each other very well — Donenfeld was a social, chance-taking high-flyer, while Liebowitz was cautious and had a logical mind that ensured Donenfeld's fiscal mistakes were small, and that his business promises were binding only in favor to himself.
When Liebowitz first worked for Donenfeld, the latter's empire was little more than a publishing house for "sex pulp" and art nudie magazines distributed by Eastern News, a company run by Charles Dreyfus and Paul Sampliner. In 1931, Eastern News faced bankruptcy and could no longer pay its publishers; the company owed Donenfeld alone $30,000. A compromise was called for, and Donenfeld, not wanting to find himself hamstrung by a distributor again, approached Sampliner with the idea of creating the Independent News Company, a publishing house with its own distribution system. As a publisher, Donenfeld had managed to dodge creditors and break deals, but as a distributor, he came to rely more on Liebowitz to ensure that the company ran smoothly. Liebowitz ensured bills were paid on time and began to build a trust with clients that Donenfeld's enterprises had never experienced.
National/DC.
In 1935, Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson came to Independent News seeking a new distributor for the comic book projects his company, National Allied Publications, was producing. Although comic books were not Donenfeld's main field, he took on Wheeler-Nicholson, and Independent News began printing and distributing comic books. Wheeler-Nicholson brought out two comics, "New Fun" and "New Comics" — the former of historical note as the first modern comic book with all-original material, as opposed to newspaper-comic reprints with occasional, tangential new material — but it would be his third publication, "Detective Comics", that would prove key. Already in considerable debt with Independent, Wheeler-Nicholson could only fund publication of "Detective Comics" by creating a subsidiary company — Detective Comics Incorporated — in partnership with Liebowitz. 
In 1938, Donenfeld managed to remove Wheeler-Nicholson from the equation, pushing Detective Comics, Inc. into bankruptcy and buying its assets. As part of the bankruptcy action, Liebowitz — now sole owner of Detective Comics Inc. — bought up Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications, and Donenfeld and Liebowitz assumed control over the entire, growing comic-book publisher.
Liebowitz, now in control of the fledgling company, devised the title for what was to become National/DC's most important comic book: "Action Comics". He asked editor Vin Sullivan to find material to fill the new title, and Sullivan, Liebowitz and Sheldon Mayer ultimately created comics history and kickstarted what historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comic Books by selecting writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster's character Superman to star in the new title.
All-American Publications.
In the late 1930s, Max Gaines, who had past experience as a comic book publisher, approached Donenfeld for finances and distribution to set up his own publishing company. Donenfeld agreed, on the condition that Gaines take Liebowitz on as partner. Donenfeld arranged this not only to reward Liebowitz for his work with Independent News, but also as a hook to keep Liebowitz with the company and to ensure Gaines would not act outside the interests of Donenfeld's business. By the end of 1938, Gaines and Liebowitz were principal and minority owner, respectively, of All-American Publications, an independent sister-company to National/DC.
In 1945/46, Gaines left All-American to found his own company — initially called Educational Comics, later known as EC — allowing Liebowitz to buy his interest in the company. Liebowitz promptly merged All-American with DC/National, and he and Donenfeld continued publishing the best of both companies' titles.
New media.
As the years went by, Liebowitz stayed at the forefront of new technologies and entertainment media, helping oversee Superman's transition to movie serials starring Kirk Alyn; to radio; and to theatrical animated shorts.
Comics historian Gerard Jones described Liebowitz as the only comics publisher who "made any real effort to make the new medium work for him" when in 1951 producer Whitney Ellsworth brought the syndicated series "Adventures of Superman" to television.
Company changes.
DC Comics went public in 1961, and became officially known as National Periodical Publications with Liebowitz remaining president of what was by then America's foremost comics publisher. Six years later, Kinney National Services acquired the company; the following year, Kinney also bought Warner Bros. to form Warner Communications.
Liebowitz continued to be an active member of the Warner Communications board, visiting his office daily even into his 91st year, finally relinquishing his place in 1991.
1950s acquisitions.
In the 1950s the comics industry suffered a massive shrink in sales, credited by many to the newly introduced Comics Code Authority, which banned publications that printed scenes of what was described as of a horrific, violent or sexual nature. This not only affected the popular horror and crime comics, but even the teen romance market. Liebowitz, who had pushed for a moral code in his own publications earlier in his career, was made vice-president of the organization under John Goldwater, and unsurprisingly was least affected by the new code, as his own comics were in-line with the code before it was introduced.
In 1956 the comics market had shrunk by fifty percent compared to its early 1950 levels. When the American News Company was found guilty of restraint of trade in 1957 it was forced to divest itself of its newsstands. This caused George Delacorte of Dell Comics to a find a new distributor, and this in turn spelled the end of American News. Of those companies that had survived the early 1950s only half remained after the loss of such a large distributor. Liebowitz made three notable distribution acquisitions during this turmoil. The first was Martin Goodman's publishing company (whose staff would later form Marvel Comics), Bill Gaines's "Mad" magazine and Hugh Hefner's "Playboy".
Non-publishing work and life.
A founding trustee of the Long Island Jewish Hospital (renamed North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System), Liebowitz served on the board for over 50 years, beginning 1949, acting as honorary chairman, and was also the medical center's second president, from 1956 to 1968. In addition, he was a trustee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in New York. 
In 1985, DC Comics named Liebowitz as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication "Fifty Who Made DC Great".
Liebowitz died December 11, 2000, survived by his second wife, Shirley (his first wife, Rose, died in 1956), his two daughters, Linda and Joan, his stepson Robert, and his great grandchildren Eliana, Alex, Josh, Ben, Leo, Harry, and Ariana. Liebowitz's niece Carole was married for many years to Harry Donenfeld's son, Irwin, a long-time DC executive (and co-owner).

Sithole was the leader of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) for 25 years. He stepped down in October 2009.
In 1995, Sithole was threatened with deportation, and later kidnapped and abandoned in the boot of a car.
He was arrested on 30 January, 1997 in an attempt to head off a general strike, along with SFTU senior officers, Richard Nxumalo, Jabulani Nxumalo and Themba Msibi. They were charged with threatening bus company owners to keep their vehicles off the road, but were released after a magistrate found there was no basis to the charges.

Parliament.
In the 20 September 2013 elections for Swaziland's House of Assembly, Sithole was elected as one of 55 MPs, nominally as an independent (since Swaziland does not recognize political parties. Sithole and his organization were pledged to reform the current governance system in Swaziland from the inside, to "achieve a multiparty Swaziland but through a strategy of participating, as opposed to non-participation". He stated that he was not the only member of his party elected.

USS Midland (AK-195)

USS "Midland" (AK-195) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship that was constructed by the U.S. Navy during the closing period of World War II. She was declared excess-to-needs and returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission shortly after being in commission for only a short period of time.
Service career.
"Midland" (AK 195) was laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Walter Butler Shipbuilders, Inc., Superior, Wisconsin, 29 July 1944; launched 23 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. William G. Mitsch; converted by the New Orleans Naval Station; acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Commission on loan charter 17 August 1945.
"Midland" was placed in service the same day to be ferried from Beaumont, Texas, to Galveston, Texas, and placed out of service upon arrival the 18th; and commissioned 27 September 1945, Lt. Lloyd K. Barry, USNR, in command. Because of the reduced need for cargo ships following World War II, "Midland" decommissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, 13 November 1945 and was returned to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) the same day for service under the Maritime Commission as "Coastal Harbinger".

Union Labor Party (California)

The Union Labor Party was a San Francisco, California working class political party of the first decade of the 20th century. The organization, which endorsed the doctrine of nativism, rose to prominence in both the labor movement and urban politics in the years after 1901, electing its nominee as Mayor of San Francisco in 1909.
Organizational history.
Background.
During the first decade of the 20th century, employers across America made effective use of judicial injunctions to prohibit trade unions from engaging in strikes to win recognition for themselves and wage-and-hour gains for their members. This so-called "open shop drive" put organized labor, concentrated in an array of local and international craft unions joined under the umbrella of the American Federation of Labor on the defensive.
In San Francisco, one of the most heavily unionized cities in the country, matters came to a head in the summer of 1901 when a local employers' association, the Draymen's Association, locked out the city's unionized teamsters on July 21. The lockout spread to the entire waterfront, which saw the city's transportation essentially shut down.
Strikebreakers were imported by the employers, who were met by force, leading to calls by the employers for police assistance. When police were deployed by the Chief of Police, the city's 14 maritime unions joined together in the City Front Federation and voted to initiate a mass sympathy strike in support of the locked out teamsters, rather than see the teamsters' union crushed. Some 16,000 longshoremen, clerks, packers, and warehouse workers joined the work stoppage, thereby increasing the volatility of the situation.
San Francisco's Democratic mayor, James D. Phelan, who had been elected thanks in large measure to the support of organized labor, sided with the employers in the battle and gave the Chief of Police authorization to smash the strike. Extreme violence followed, in which picketing workers were clubbed and even shot, resulting in 5 deaths and 336 reported cases of assault. Hundreds more strikers were arrested.
The perceived "treachery" of Mayor Phelan caused San Francisco's organized labor movement to rethink its previous strategy of attempting to elect and influence its "friends" in the Democratic and Republican parties. Instead, the unions sought an independent political organization to elect their own people to positions of power so that the violence of the state would not be turned against them in a future replay of the strike of 1901.
The Union Labor Party was the result of this change of perspective.
Union formed.
On September 5, 1901, approximately 300 delegates representing 68 of San Francisco's unions gathered together in a convention to establish the Union Labor Party of the City and County of San Francisco. The convention approved a platform including a call for the revision of the city charter to curb future intervention by the city administration in labor disputes, a demand for municipal ownership of all public utilities, building more schools and the initiation of the merit system in the promotion of teachers, and the abolition of the poll tax. The platform also contained a frankly nativist demand for the restriction of Asian immigration and the creation of segregated schools for Asian children.
The new political party nominated Eugene E. Schmitz, president of the Musicians' Union, as its candidate for Mayor. He was backed by lawyer and political boss Abe Ruef, who threw his considerable influence behind Schmitz. The union put up a slate of its candidates for all other elected positions. The organization was ultimately endorsed by every San Francisco union with the exception of the local Building Trades Council and was bitterly opposed by every newspaper with the exception of the "San Francisco Examiner," owned by William Randolph Hearst.
The election of November 1901 proved a great triumph for the union, with its mayoral candidate winning election by a plurality of over 20,000 votes. Three of its members were elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and the group fell just 50 votes short of electing 3 more.
Immediately after the election, the teamsters' strike was finally settled in favor of the trade unions. Strikebreakers were discharged and the striking unionized workers were reinstated. The Teamsters Union was recognized, the union wage scale initiated, and the 48-hour week established. While the union demand for a closed shop was not immediately granted, the year 1901 nevertheless marked a major victory for organized labor and marked a high-water mark for the trade unions of San Francisco and their Union Labor Party.
The ULP in power.
With City Hall in the hands of the Union Labor Party, San Francisco's trade unions launched a series of successful strikes in 1902. The city's streetcar employees launched a strike to reverse a 1901 wage cut and to win union recognition, an action which snarled San Francisco's internal transportation. The United Railway Company, employer of the streetcar workers, attempted to import strikebreakers, but this time the ULP Mayor of San Francisco prohibited the company's request for a police guard and ordered that no special permits be granted for security guards to carry firearms. Eight days later, the company signed a contract with its employees which granted all of the union's demands.
Despite some misgivings on the party of Samuel Gompers and other national officials of the American Federation of Labor, the ULP continued its electoral success in 1903, when Eugene Schmitz was renominated for Mayor of San Francisco and won re-election by more than 26,000 votes.
Anti-union forces may have been defeated in the elections, but by no means was there an end to their own organizing. In 1904 there came to San Francisco a new organization known as the Citizen's Alliance, headed by Herbert George, one of the city's leaders of the open shop movement. George initially launched the Citizens' Alliance in Denver, Colorado with great success before importing the organization to the less hospitable soil of the city by the bay. By the end of 1904, George's organization claimed a membership of 16,000, including employers pledged to restore "the Americanism of the Open Shop in San Francisco."
In the election of 1905, the Citizens' Alliance sought to fragment the union opposition by launching a puppet organization called the United Labor League. The Citizens' Alliance counted on a split of the labor movement, centered around the conservative Building Trades Council headed by P.H. McCarthy, against which would be pitted a fusion candidate combining the forces of the Republicans and the Democrats under the slogan of "Law and Order."
Contrary to the best-laid plans of the open shop advocates, McCarthy and the previously resistant Building Trades Council united behind Schmitz and the Union Labor Party in the election of 1905, helping him to win a third term of office.
The ULP in retreat.
The year 1907 marked the watershed for the Union Labor Party. In that year, a series of revelations took place detailing graft and corruption in municipal administration, culminating in an investigation and prosecution that showed that the Union Labor Party and the city's Mayor were in the control of political boss Abe Ruef, who received financial kickbacks in the guise of legal fees from public utilities, gambling houses, and houses of prostitution. The fall of Mayor Eugene Schmitz in the midst of the San Francisco Streetcar Strike of 1907 undermined the strike effort, which ended in utter failure after months of violence between the Carmen's Union and out-of-town mercenary strikebreakers.
While little different than the corruption in other major American cities, such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Chicago, and New York, the San Francisco city graft scandal drew deafening wails of criticism from the local and national press, which sought to emphasize an inevitable connection between labor unions and official dishonesty.
The ULP's 1909 platform advocated public ownership of utilities, a new civic auditorium, extensive public works, and a U.S. citizen-only hiring policy. The ULP nominated and elected the conservative P.H. McCarthy of the San Francisco Building Trades Council in the 1909 mayoral election. While McCarthy's administration was largely scandal-free, it suffered from a number of political failures.
Businessmen chose James Rolph, Jr., known as "Sunny Jim", to run against him in 1911. Rolph won that election and the ULP faded from the scene.

Sustainable growth rate

According to PIMS (Profit Impact of Marketing Strategy) an important lever of business success is growth. Among 37 variables, growth is mentioned as one of the most important variables for success: market share, market growth, marketing expense to sales ratio or a strong market position. 
The question how much growth is sustainable is answered by two concepts with different perspectives:
Sustainable growth rates (SGR) from a financial perspective.
The sustainable growth rate according to Robert C. Higgins is the maximum growth rate a company can achieve consistent with the firm`s established financial policy. Basically, it is calculated as: 
SGR = (pm*(1-d)*(1+L)) / (T-(pm*(1-d)*(1+L))) 
In order to grow faster, the company would have to invest more equity capital, increase its financial leverage or increase the target profit margin.
The sustainable growth rate model assumes several simplifications such as depreciation is sufficient to maintain the value of existing assets, the profit margin remains stable (also for new businesses), the proportion of assets and sales remains stable (also for new businesses) and the company maintains its current capital structure and dividend payout policy.
The sustainable growth rate model has implications for valuation models, as for instance the Gordon model and other discounted cash flow models require a growth estimate that can be sustained for many years. The sustainable growth rate can be a check if business plans are reasonable.
Optimal growth rates from a total shareholder value creation and profitability perspective.
Optimal Growth according to Martin Handschuh, Hannes Lösch and Björn Heyden is the growth rate which assures sustainable company development – considering the long-term relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability. 
Assessment basis: The work is based on assessments on the performance of more than 3500 stock-listed companies with an initial revenue of greater 250 million Euro globally and across industries over a period of 12 years from 1997 till 2009. Due to this long time period, the authors consider their findings as to a large extent independent of specific economic cycles.
Relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability.
In the long-term and across industries, total shareholder value creation (stock price development plus dividend payments) rises steadily with increasing revenue growth rates. The more long-term revenue growth companies realize, the more investors appreciate this and the more they get rewarded.
Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Sales (ROS) and Return on Equity (ROE) do rise with increasing revenue growth up to 10 to 25% and then fall with further increasing revenue growth rates.
Also the combined ROX-index (average of ROA, ROS and ROE) shows rises with increasing growth rates to a broad maximum in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth per year and falls towards higher growth rates. 
The authors attribute the continuous profitability increase towards the maximum of two effects:
Beyond the profitability maximum extra efforts to handle additional growth – e.g. based on integrating new staff in large dimensions and handling culture and quality - do rise sharply and reduce overall profitability. 
The combination of the patterns of revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability indicates three growth zones:
Growth rates of the assessed companies are widely independent of initial company size/ market share which is in alignment with Gibrath`s law. Gibrat's law, sometimes called Gibrat's rule of proportionate growth is a rule defined by Robert Gibrat (1904–1980) stating that the size of a firm and its growth rate are independent.
Independent of industry consolidation and industry growth rate, companies in many industries with growth rates in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth p.a. have both, higher total shareholder value generation as well as profitability than their slower growing peers.
Base strategies and growth moves.
These findings do suggest two base strategies for companies:
How to achieve long-term growth in the sweet-spot and beyond.
The authors have identified a set of preconditions and levers to achieve long-term growth in their defined sweet-spot and beyond:
Criticism.
As described the sustainable growth rate (SGR) concept by Robert C. Higgins is based on several assumptions such as constant profit margin, constant debt to equity ratio or constant asset to sales ratio. Therefore, general applicability of SGR concept in cases where these parameters are not stable is limited.
The Optimal Growth concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes Lösch, Björn Heyden et al. has no restrictions to certain strategies or business model and is therefore more flexible in its applicability. However, as a broad framework, it only provides an orientation for case/company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting. Additional company and market specific considerations, e.g. market growth, growth culture, appetite for change, are required to come up with the optimal growth rate of a specific company. 
Additionally, considering the increasing criticism of excessive growth and shareholder value orientation by philosophers, economists and also managers, e.g. Stéphane Hessel, Kenneth Boulding, Jack Welch (nowadays), one might expect that investors` investment criteria might also change in the future. This may lead to changes in the relationship of revenue growth rates and total shareholder value creation. Regular reviews of the optimal growth assessments may be used as an indicator for the development of stock markets` appetite for rapid growth.

RAF Llandwrog was opened in January 1941 as a RAF Bomber Command airfield for training gunners, radio operators and navigators. It was located at Llandwrog, 4 nautical miles (7.4 km) southwest of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, Wales, and it remains in civil operation today as Caernarfon Airport.
World War II.
It was the largest World War II airfield in Wales. The Air Observers School flew Avro Anson and Westland Lysander aircraft.
On 10 October 1941 two aircraft collided at RAF Llandwrog, killing seventeen people.
Mountain Rescue.
Early in 1942, prompted by an increasing number of aircraft accidents in the North Wales mountains, the "RAF Llandwrog Mountain Rescue Section" was formed on a local, volunteer basis. The initiative came from the medical officer at the base, Flight Lieutenant G R Graham. The team at Llandwrog, and other similar teams elsewhere, were officially recognised towards the end of 1943. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service started operations in May 1943 but due to the administrative lag of wartime was not officially promulgated until January 1944.
Chemical weapons storage.
Almost 71,000 bombs containing the nerve agent tabun had been seized in Germany following WWII, and these were stored in the open at RAF Llandwrog, until 1954 when, in Operation Sandcastle, they were transported to Cairnryan for disposal aboard scuttling ships at sea 120 miles (190 km) north-west of Ireland.

Andrew Marc

Andrew Marc is an American luxury fashion brand. The company originated as a leather goods label established in 1982. Andrew Marc is headquartered just south of Times Square, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.
Management history.
Founded in 1982.
In November 2004, GB Merchant Partners partnered with company's founders as part of a leveraged recapitalization, in order to enable the brand to expand its reach. However, in February 2008, the brand was acquired by the G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NASDAQ: GIII). The G-III Apparel Group, Ltd., led by Morris Goldfarb, made its acquisition of Andrew Marc official on Feb 11, 2008. The procurement of Andrew Marc provided G-III with a luxury brand, and an expanded mid-tier presence through the Levi's and Dockers licenses.
Design, image and marketing.
The company include a secondary label, Marc New York by Andrew Marc. In the fall of 2012, the company launched Marc Moto, a denim label, which designs items for a younger demographic. In spring 2013, the name was modified to Denim & Leathers.
Chris Gbur is the in-house creative director at Andrew Marc. Gbur has been with the company for 25 years, and is responsible for all of the company's advertisement campaigns. Images are often being shot in New York City and printed in sepia or grey scale.
Merchandising.
Andrew Marc is a luxury apparel line focused primarily on men's and women's outerwear. The brand uses innovations in leather treatments including: waxes, distressing, pigmentation, oxidation and organic dying processes.
Since its inception in 1982, Andrew Marc has expanded its products to include wool and cloth and all-season materials in its outerwear assortment. No longer limited to outerwear, the brand produces dresses under both the Andrew Marc and Marc New York labels. In addition, the brand carries women's and men's accessories, which include women's handbags, designed in-house under the G-III Apparel Group accessory division; men's sport and travel bags designed by Mundi Westport; shirts and ties produced through an agreement with Phillip Van Heusen, and men's and women's sunglasses and watches. Sunglasses and eyewear are designed in conjunction with Cejon, while watches are created as part of an agreement between Andrew Marc and Collibri. Sweaters are produced through a Bernette Textile licensing agreement. Recently, Andrew Marc entered into an agreement with S4 Footwear LLC to produce men's footwear that debuted in fall 2012.
Commenting on the expansion, Morris Goldfarb, G-III's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""We are excited to begin the broader development of the Andrew Marc and Marc New York branded businesses, which hold an excellent position in upscale specialty retailers and department stores. We believe that the contemporary aesthetic and high-fashion identity of these brands can quickly and decisively transcend their roots from the outerwear market.""
Marc Moto, a collection of premium denim and leathers, is the third label under the Andrew Marc brand. Marc Moto's target market is a younger demographic than the other labels in the brand. In addition to denim and leather products, Marc Moto produces footwear, t-shirts, and accessories, inspired by motor sport.
Distribution.
Andrew Marc is positioned in the luxury tier similar to labels such as Cole Haan and Burberry. The men's and women's collections are distributed through the company's website. Andrew Marc products can be found in most national department stores including Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and Saks Fifth Avenue, and, in Canada, Harry Rosen.

Life in One Day

The third single from Howard Jones' 1985 album "Dream Into Action", "Life in One Day" was another uptempo number, which lyrically warned against wishing one's life away. It reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart, and number 19 on the United States "Billboard" Hot 100. 
The 12" version featured a pair of remixes of the lead track which were more obviously different in structure from the original than was the norm on Jones' previous releases. Part One was a vocal mix, and Part Two a largely instrumental dub mix.
The UK B side, "Boom Bap Respite", a piano instrumental, was not included in the US release. Instead the song was coupled with "Learning How to Love", a song previously available the UK on the single "Look Mama".
Track listing.
7" (US Single)
Released as a twinpack in a gatefold sleeve. 
Other versions.
Jones, along with Afrodiziak who contributed backing vocals on the original, performed "Life in One Day" in an a cappella style live at the Shaftsbury Theatre in London as part of a series of music/alternative comedy shows held in April 1986 by the charity Comic Relief. A recording of this performance was issued later on the album "Utterly Utterly Live".
Played by Jones on grand piano accompanied only by a percussionist, the song appeared on the 1996 album "Live Acoustic America".
An entirely re-recorded version featuring Jones' touring band at the time was included on the limited edition 2000 studio album "Pefawm".
Another live rendition appeared on the 2007 album, "Live in Birkenhead", this time performed on piano and guitar.
Video.
A promotional video to accompany the song was produced by Godley & Creme. It featured Jones in a variety of roles, sometimes so heavily disguised as to be barely recognizable. It parodied a variety of television adverts and programmes in a series of vignettes, interrupted by visual effects simulating poor television reception and other similar faults.

Homotopy fiber

In mathematics, especially homotopy theory, the homotopy fiber is part of a construction that associates a fibration to an arbitrary continuous function of topological spaces .
In particular, given such a map, define to be the set of pairs where and is a path such that . We give a topology by giving it the subspace topology as a subset of (where is the space of paths in which as a function space has the compact-open topology). Then the map given by is a fibration. Furthermore, is homotopy equivalent to as follows: Embed as a subspace of by where is the constant path at . Then deformation retracts to this subspace by contracting the paths.
The fiber of this fibration (which is only well-defined up to homotopy equivalence) is the homotopy fiber , which can be defined as the set of all with and a path such that and , where is some fixed basepoint of .
In the special case that the original map was a fibration with fiber , then the homotopy equivalence given above will be a map of fibrations over . This will induce a morphism of their long exact sequences of homotopy groups, from which (by applying the Five Lemma) one can see that the map is a weak equivalence. Thus the above given construction reproduces the same homotopy type if there already is one.

Freda Thompson

Freda Thompson OBE (5 April 1909 - 11 December 1980) was a pioneer aviator, the first Australian woman to fly solo from the United Kingdom to Australia.
Biography.
Born at South Yarra, Melbourne Victoria to parents Frederick and Martha Thompson, Thompson was educated at Toorak College in Melbourne leaving with Honours, Proficiency Certificates Pianoforte and Ice Skating. On 28 May 1930 she did her first flight as a pilot and later in that year obtained her A Licence. In 1932 Thompson obtained her Commercial Pilots licence and won the Adelaide Aerial Derby for Victoria. In 1933 she was the first woman in the British Empire obtain an Instructors Licence.
In April 1934 Thompson sailed for England to pick up her brand new De Havilland Moth Major which had been fitted with long range fuel tanks for the journey to Australia. Thompson had accumulated over 250 hours of flying experience by this time. On 28 September 1934 Freda left Lympne, Kent for the long journey to Australia flying solo. The trip took 39 days with the actual flying time being 19 days. Thompson damaged her aeroplane G-ACUC (VH-UUC) when she made a precautionary landing at Megara, Greece, the flight to Australia was delayed by 20 days waiting for a spare part for a damaged wing. Freda arrived in Darwin on the 6th November.
In 1937 Thompson was awarded King George VI's coronation medal and in 1953 she was awarded Queen Elizabeth II's coronation medal. In 1937 Freda was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
Thompson died at Malvern and was cremated. In 1994 she was honoured by the issue of a postage stamp by Australia Post, one of a series depicting Australian aviators also including Stanley Goble and Ivor McIntyre, Lawrence Hargrave, Sir Keith and Sir Ross Macpherson Smith.

Community colleges in the United States

In the United States, community colleges (once commonly called junior colleges) are primarily two-year public institutions of higher education. After graduating from a community college, some students transfer to a university or liberal arts college for two to three years to complete a bachelor's degree, while others enter the workforce.
Terminology.
Before the 1970s, community colleges were more commonly referred to as junior colleges, and that term is still used at some institutions and for athletics, specifically the NJCAA. However, the term "junior college" has evolved to describe private two-year institutions, whereas the term "community college" has evolved to describe publicly funded two-year institutions. As such, the main governing body of community colleges changed its name in 1992 from the "American Association of Junior Colleges" to the "American Association of Community Colleges".
In New Jersey, slightly more than half of the state's nineteen community colleges are called county colleges, not merely in name but also in descriptive speech. This is because there is one community college, often with satellite branches, dedicated to each county of the state. The term is also used by some community colleges in Texas (where community colleges are funded by county residents via property taxes assessed by a special "community college district"), Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois. The City University of New York is a well known municipally-funded community college system, although the system includes both junior and senior (4-year) colleges, in addition to graduate programs.
City colleges.
In several California cities (including Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Sacramento), and in other large cities such as Chicago, with its City Colleges of Chicago, community colleges are often called "city colleges," since they were municipally-funded and designed to serve the needs of the residents of the city in which they are situated. Also, the state's public two-year colleges are not solely found in its larger cities. El Camino College, at one time the largest single-campus community college in the nation, is not in any city or town, but was created by the state legislature, at the request of members of the Los Angeles (County) Board of Supervisors, on unincorporated county land adjacent to Torrance, and was granted the same operational authority over its campus as any city government exercises over its incorporated land. In many of California's most rural counties, a comparably independent community college levies its own property tax, has an independent but fully deputized police force and an elected board with broad powers. In some parts of the country, the establishment of community colleges has been a state initiative unsupported by county residents. New York City's network of community colleges was established outside of the CUNY system, and only integrated into that system at the insistence of the state government. Another example is Westchester Community College. In the late 1940s, the county operated a popular vocational institute. The New York state government required that the county transform its technical institute into a community college. The county government resisted this transformation, as it would be responsible for 1/3rd of the new institution's operating costs (in contrast, the state paid for all of the technical institute's operating costs). After a series of very heated meetings, fully reported in the local press, the county was forced to conform to the state government's wishes. As a general rule, broad generalizations about the origins, purposes, and funding of public two-year colleges varies widely among the states and, as in the case of California, within states. 
Further, because the vital role played by rural community colleges in preparing excess rural youth for productive careers in urban centers is not well understood by policy makers, these relatively small institutions do not receive sufficient state funding to offset their weak tax bases and, because of their relatively small size, much higher per-student costs when compared to urban community colleges. This inequity in basic institutional funding has led to the creation of such organizations as the Community Colleges of Appalachia and the tribal college association, which have sought to promote more equitable funding irrespective of an institution's size or location. A well-funded network of rural community colleges is essential to the nation's long-term economic well being. Rural community colleges prepare excess rural youth for employment opportunities in the nation's urban centers and helps the nation to avoid the often dramatic differences in income and life opportunities that would result if excess rural youth migrated to urban centers without highly marketable job skills.
History.
Many events have contributed to the development and continued growth of community colleges. The social and economic climate of the early twentieth century led to vocal activists for a two-year educational alternative to four-year higher education institutions. Several different groups advocated for community colleges in the early twentieth century, including students and parents, educators, businesses, state universities, and government officials. Events like urbanization, industrialization, and economic development caused changes in society. One of education’s responses to a country in transition was the junior college.
Several different movements supported the creation of community colleges, including local community support of public and private two-year institutions, the expansion of the public education system, increased professional standards for teachers, the vocational education movement, and an expanding demand for adult and community education. Numerous colleges and universities advocated for the development of junior colleges. Leadership felt small, private liberal arts colleges and high schools could provide the first two years of college while larger universities could focus resources on research and junior and senior level students.
Early community colleges.
“The two-year college has been a distinctively American creation, and nowhere else has it attained such prominence.” J. L. Ratcliff. suggests one perspective for the presence of American two-year post secondary institutions of the past century: they began in the private sector after the Panic of 1894. J M Carroll, president of Baylor University, made a pragmatic suggestion to solve the problem of too many Baptist colleges with insufficient funds and not enough students to support them: reduce the smaller Baptist colleges’ curriculum to the freshman and sophomore years. After this preliminary period, Baylor University would accept the two-year students and provide the junior and senior years of their academic plan. Dr. Carroll believed this fragmentation of a student’s degree seeking path could remedy the depressed college situations by requiring a smaller group of faculty and fewer resources for the first two years of higher education. Such planning would not reduce the existing number of institutions or the roles they had developed in the communities where they were founded—only the length of enrollment on the campuses. This measure was a proactive response to accommodate a continued trend analysis of low enrollment and assure the economical operation of all the Baptist institutions. Also, the catastrophic economic repercussions to the industries and businesses of the towns where the smaller colleges were located would be minimized.
Before this innovation of two-year campuses with transfer missions in the private sector, a few public institutions before 1850 offered two years of college: Lasell Junior College in Auburndale, Massachusetts and Vincennes University of Vincennes, Indiana. Dr. Helland cites a section from the 1899 Vincennes University catalog, in which these statements are found: “The Vincennes University occupies a unique position in the educational field. It is half-way between the commissioned high school and the full-fledged college: it is in fact a junior college.” Many of the early public community colleges were an extension of high schools, like the first established, Joliet Junior College, in 1901. This was a two-year system compared to one year high school extension. These initial community colleges generally were very small (usually fewer than 200 students) and focused on a liberal arts education with the goal of transferring students to four-year institutions. They were more reflective of high school needs and lacked a definite identity. These examples of two-year structure innovations with transfer missions in the private and public sector provided a pragmatic approach for the preservation of existing institutions.
Many of the early community colleges were normal schools and prepared teachers. Primary emphasis was placed on traditional middle class values and developing responsible citizens. Normal Schools began in Massachusetts in the 1880s as extensions of local high schools. They were originated to meet the need for teacher preparation. For example, in Saint Joseph, Missouri, a Normal School was added to the local high school to provide a career track for women who wanted to teach. Mr. Whiteford, the area’s district superintendent, inquired of the University of Missouri to determine if credits from Saint Joseph Normal School could transfer into a baccalaureate program. The University’s President Dr. Hill acknowledged the request and provided for the articulation. Coincidently, Dr. Hill was actively involved in the American Association of Universities and calling for the establishment of junior colleges for this purpose. In Minnesota, St. Paul’s Public School District established a “City Training School” for preparing teachers. The 1883 school’s mission was to provide certified teachers and substitutes for the district. Mrs. M. E. Jenness from the Normal School at River Falls, Wisconsin was the St. Paul School’s first principal; Mrs. N. F. Wheaton was the Director of Practice. Wheaton had been employed at the Oshkosh Normal School in Wisconsin. In Minneapolis, a Normal Training School was instituted in the fall of 1887. Miss Adele Evers of Manchester Normal School in New Hampshire was appointed the first teacher; she was one of six candidates for the position. Evers’ references included work at Martha’s Vineyard and Saratoga.
During the 1920s and 1930s there was a shift in the purpose of community colleges to developing a workforce, which was influenced by wide unemployment during the Great Depression. Developing "semiprofessionals" became dominant national language to describe junior college students. The notion that engineers and supervisors make primary decisions about what and how activities were to be done in the workplace provided the origins for employees needed to carry out their decisions. This need for a class of workers to implement the decisions of the theoreticians demanded an educational delivery system other than the traditional four-year college or university. The closed shop of the artisan which had initially provided workers was no longer the educational program of choice. Nationally, a new two-year vehicle for educating the industrial worker found its launching within the secondary public school system under the leadership of local school districts.
Baltimore’s Manual Training High School opened in 1884, was the first separate secondary school for education that was specifically work orientated. The Maryland institution was unique as a stand-alone campus. Other examples of sub-baccalaureate programs were the University Preparatory School and Junior College of Tonkawa. The result of the two- year schools founded in Oklahoma Public School Secondary System in 1902, both institutions later merged in 1914 and became the Oklahoma Institute of Technology. Dean Schneider of the University of Cincinnati developed an alternative high school with a cooperative plan where students spent one week in an occupation and the other in school. Industry provided the shop experiences and the classroom facilitated the academic. There were also non-cooperative high schools; two examples were the Girl’s Vocational High School in Kansas City, Missouri and the Delgado Trade School in New Orleans. A two-year, terminal education, was seen as more socially efficient for students who could advance past high school but not continue to attain bachelor's degrees. This national vocational movement was seen to give junior colleges a target population, but numerous students wanted more than a semiprofessional education; many maintained a desire to transfer. Throughout this time period, there was a move for more public two-year institutions along with a trend to separate from high schools and affiliate with higher education. With the change in affiliation came a new status which encouraged junior colleges to develop additional credibility through the creation of professional criteria and use of scientific methods.
Cold War era.
After World War II, the G.I. Bill afforded more educational opportunity to veterans which resulted in increased enrollments. Another factor that led to growth was the rise of adult and community education. After World War II, community colleges were seen as a good place to house continuing education programs. The 1947 President's Commission on Higher Education was a very important national document for community colleges. It suggested a network of public community colleges that would provide education to a diverse group of students at little or no cost along with serving community needs through a comprehensive mission.
This national network exploded in the 1960s with 457 community colleges and the enrollment of baby boomers. A series of grants through the Kellogg Junior College Leadership Programs helped train many community college leaders during this decade. Growth continued during the 1970s when many enrolled to escape the Vietnam era draft. The 1970s also marked a shift to faculty development, including more instructional training for the unique student body and mission of community colleges. During the 1980s, community colleges began to work more closely with high schools to prepare students for vocational and technical two-year programs.
By the end of the 20th century, all two-year institutions were playing important roles in higher education as access mechanisms. They became an integral feature for those persons who were attending higher education for the first time or as non-traditional students. Brint and Karabel have recognized the change that transpired from 1920 when fewer than 2 percent of all college freshmen were enrolled in a two-year college to the late 1980s when over 50 percent were matriculated. Junior colleges once located in high schools had left their origins to develop their own campuses and were called community colleges and still retained the transfer access mission. High school normal schools matured into teacher colleges or colleges of education within universities offering bachelor and graduate degrees. Industrial institutes integrated with local junior colleges to make these campus’s programs more comprehensive community colleges. Along with this growth and legitimization of two-year mechanisms for the delivery of higher education, the emergence of two-year institutions provided an epistemological debate that divided the river of education flowing into the early 20th century into three streams of educational natures. “In the process of this struggle and adjustment some colleges will grow stronger, some will become academies, some junior colleges; the high schools will be elevated to a still more important position than that which they now occupy. The general result will be the growth of a system in the higher educational work of the United States, where now no system exists.”
1990s and 2000s.
In recent history, a debate between the advocates and critics of community colleges has gained strength. Advocates argue community colleges serve the needs of society through providing college opportunity to students who otherwise cannot go to college, training and retraining mid-level skilled workers, and preserving the academic excellence of four-year universities. Critics argue community colleges continue a culture of privilege through training business workers at public expense, not allowing the working class to advance in social class, protecting selective admissions at four-year institutions for the nation's elite, and discouraging transfer through cooling out. Whether community colleges give opportunity or protect privilege, their century-long history has developed a distinctive aspect of higher education. Although the growth of community colleges has stabilized in recent history, enrollment continues to outgrow four-year institutions. A total of 1,166 loosely-linked community colleges face challenges of new technological innovations, distance learning, funding constraints, community pressure, and international influence.. Some of the issues currently faced are explored in community college resources compiled by the Association for Career and Technical Education.

Governance.
State Governance
The higher education governance structure landscape in America is very diverse; they are not intended to be precise organization charts. According to the Education Commission of the States there are three major types of higher education governance systems in the states; they are Governing Board States, Coordinating Board States and Planning/ Regulatory/Service Agency States. (from: The Education Commission of the States website)
The Governing Board States (GBS)
State-level governing boards are distinguished according to whether they are responsible for consolidated systems or multi-campus systems. Consolidated systems are composed of several previously independently governed institutions that were later consolidated into one system. Multi-campus systems developed primarily through extensions of various branches or campuses.
Coordinating Board States
Coordinating boards vary significantly in formal authority and informal power and influence from state to state. Generally, there is a state level board governing universities, colleges, and community colleges. Each university and community college district will have its own board that is accountable to a state-coordinating agency.
The Planning/Regulatory/Service Agency States (PRSA)
The PRSA states have limited or non-existent formal governing or coordinating authority, which carry out regulatory and service functions such as student financial aid.
For a comprehensive list of American community colleges and their state level governing boards: "U.S. Community Colleges by State, University of Texas at Austin"<br>
A more thorough description of state level college and university governance models can be found at: "Models of Postsecondary Education Coordination and Governance in the States"
Local Governance
Most community colleges are operated within special districts that draw property tax revenue from the local community, as a division of a state university, or as a sister institution within a state-wide higher education system.
In all cases, community colleges are governed by a board of trustees, appointed by the state governor, or the board is elected by citizens residing within the community college district. In some instances, as with the City Colleges of Chicago, the board of trustees is appointed by the presiding local government. In Chicago, it is the mayor who appoints the board.
Depending on the operational system, the board of trustees may directly govern the college or may govern the college through a university or system-level office. Depending upon the locus of control, the board may or may not be subject to control by a state agency that supervises all community college districts or all higher education institutions within the state.
The board of trustees selects a president or chancellor of the community college to serve as the chief executive officer and lead the faculty and staff.
Multi-College Community College District
Multi-College Community College Districts include several individually accredited community colleges within one district. Each college is independent with distinct local administration, but they share a single board of trustees and report to a non-instructional central administrative office.
The Contra Costa Community College District is an example of one of the largest multi-college community college districts in California. The District consists of Contra Costa College, Diablo Valley College, Los Medanos College, San Ramon Campus, and Brentwood Center, and annually serves almost 62,000 students.
Multi-campus Community College District
larger schools implement a multi-campus system and generally share a single accreditation. Local administrative governance varies. Extension campuses report to the main campus administration or a central administrative office. A good example of this is College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, which has 6 satellite campuses within a 10 mile area, in addition to its main campus, which itself has 9 structures and an enrollment of over 30,000 students.
Faculty Governance
Faculty Senate/Faculty Council
A faculty senate, or faculty council as this body is sometimes referred to, is the representative body of all faculty who participate in the governance processes of the community college. As with all governing bodies, the faculty senate is usually governed by a constitution and a set of bylaws specific to the college. Membership in this body varies from college, with most restricting voting rights to tenured and tenure track faculty, and others allowing a wider array of members to include full-time, adjunct, continuing education, technical, and adult basic education faculty. (modified from: http://www.pima.edu/facsenate/)
Though this is not an exhaustive list, the mission of the faculty senate at the community college usually includes: matters concerning curricular decisions; strengthening the concept of the faculty as a college entity; promoting the gathering, exchanging, and disseminating of faculty views and concerns regarding college matters; promoting mutual accountability between the college faculty and the faculty representative to any college committee; advising the Chancellor and other administrators of faculty views on college matters; bringing the concerns of the Chancellor and other administrators on college matters to the faculty; promoting the involvement of all faculty members in the establishing, staffing, and functioning of college committees, task forces, or other initiatives; and participating in the policy review process of the college.
Collective Bargaining Units/Agreements
Most community college faculty are bargained for employees. While unions and their respective collective bargaining agreements serve to protect faculty rights and working conditions, collective bargaining agreements, or union contracts, provide faculty with a defined set of rules and regulations they must follow as a condition of employment.
Collective bargaining swept into higher education on the coattails of legislation authorizing public employees to negotiate. As these laws were passed in various states in the 1960s and 1970s, employee groups ranging from refuse collectors to prison guards gained union representation and began negotiating contracts (Cohen & Brawer, 2008, p. 147)
Collective bargaining units exist for all divisions of community college faculty; however, participation by faculty groups differs from college to college.
Student Governance
There is a student government organizational presence on close to every community college campus in America The Student Government organization is the official voice of the student body, a vital link in effective student participation in all areas of student concern in relationship to the college’s administration. By advocating student rights and services, the organization represents the student body and presents its concerns to the college administration, local, and national issues. Through the Student Government organizations the college provides students with essential leadership experience, and valuable connections with faculty, staff administration, students, and the Board of Trustees. Student involvement is usually based on criteria set by the institution; all students have the right as a student to participate in democratic process on campus. (from ASGA's entry of Bakersfield College)
Shared Governance
Shared governance is the set of practices under which college faculty and staff participates in significant decisions concerning the operation of their institutions. Colleges are very special types of institutions with a unique mission—the creation and dissemination of ideas. At the heart of shared governance is the belief that decision-making should be largely independent of short-term managerial and political considerations. Faculty and professional staff are in the best position to shape and implement curriculum and research policy, to select academic colleagues and judge their work; and The perspective of all front-line personnel is invaluable in making sound decisions about allocating resources, setting goals, choosing top officers and guiding student life.
For a more detailed explanation of governance at the community college, please see the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities and the 1998 statement on the same topic by the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges. These documents more clearly define those matters that are the responsibility of the voting faculty and those reserved to the governing body and its delegates. (From: http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2002/JA/Feat/Luce.htm)
Enrollment.
In the United States, community colleges operate under a policy of "open admission." That is, anyone with a high school diploma or GED may attend, regardless of prior academic status or college entrance exam scores. Although community colleges have an open admission policy, students have to take placement tests before enrolling at the college, due to not all courses being open admission. In California and Minnesota, students who have reached the age of 18 are not required to have completed secondary education; instead, they must simply show an "ability to benefit" from a college's educational program. Under certain circumstances, community colleges will also accept high school students or dropouts.
The open admission policy results in a wide range of students attending community college classes. Students range in age from teenagers in high school taking classes under a concurrent, or dual, enrollment policy (which allows both high school and college credits to be earned simultaneously) to working adults taking classes at night to complete a degree or gain additional skills in their field to students with graduate degrees who enroll to become more employable or to pursue lifelong interests. "Reverse transfers" (or those transferring from a university) constitute one of the fastest growing new community college cohorts.
One threat to enrollment at community colleges is the rapidly increasing popularity of for-profit e-learning and online universities, such as the University of Phoenix, now the 16th-largest university in the world. Higher education research and consulting firm Eduventures estimates that 10 percent of college students will be enrolled in an online degree program by 2008 Many community colleges have supplemented their offerings with online courses to stave off competition from exclusively e-learning schools. For example, Northern Virginia Community College's Extended Learning Institute has been offering distance learning courses for thirty-five years. Texas offers the Virtual College of Texas whereby a student at any community college in the state can attend classes from any of the state's 51 community colleges or four Texas State Technical College campuses, paying local tuition plus a VCT fee of around $40.
The Maricopa County Community College District in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, is the largest community college district in the United States in terms of enrollment.
California has the lowest community college enrollment fees in the nation, currently set at $46 per unit for state residents.
Educational offerings.
Community colleges generally offer a range of programs.
Associate degree.
In study towards an associate degree, a student takes necessary courses needed to earn a degree that will allow for entry into jobs requiring some level of college education but not a full four-year degree. The associate's degree program also allows students who wish to eventually obtain a bachelor's degree at a four-year college to complete the necessary "core" requirements to attend the college of their choice. Some states have mandated that the community college's curriculum be structured so as to satisfy "core curriculum" requirements at the state's public universities or private universities.
Many community colleges have articulation arrangements with nearby four-year institutions, where a student obtaining an associate's degree in a field will automatically have his/her classes counted toward the bachelor's degree requirement. For example, a community college associate's degree in hotel and restaurant management, computers or accounting would count toward the four-year school's core requirement for a Business Administration degree. Some have gone one step further by arrangements with a four-year college for the student to obtain the bachelor's degree from the four-year college while taking all the courses via distance learning or other non-traditional modes, thus reducing the number of physical visits to the four-year school. One such example is College of DuPage (COD) in Illinois, who have implemented a program called 3+1. In this program, students can take three years of classes at the community college taught by COD professors and faculty, and in the fourth year attend classes on the COD campus, but taught by professors of nearby partner universities, such as Benedictine University, Concordia University, Governors State University, Lewis University, and Roosevelt University.
Certification.
Certification in an area of training (such as nursing, computer repair, allied health, law enforcement, firefighting, or welding), which require preparation for a state or national examination, or where certification would allow for hiring preference or a higher salary upon entering the workforce. These courses are often geared toward the needs of the local or area business community.
Local services.
Services of local interest to members of the community, such as job placement, adult continuing education classes (either for personal achievement or to maintain certification in specialized fields), and developmental classes for children. Some community colleges offer opportunities for high school dropouts to return to school and earn a high school diploma or obtain a GED.
Bachelor's degrees.
A growing trend in the United States is for community colleges to begin offering bachelor's degrees. At least fourteen states have authorized them to do so and others are considering the issue.
Many large community colleges, such as Miami-Dade College and St. Petersburg College, in Florida have even completely dropped the words "community" or "junior" from their names as they have added bachelor's degree programs in limited fields and have started their evolution into four-year colleges while retaining their local commitments. Even some smaller community colleges, such as Northern New Mexico College in Española, New Mexico, have dropped community from their names and now offer six or more bachelor's degrees. A few of the larger institutions, such as De Anza College in northern California and College of DuPage near Chicago, who both boast enrollment of over 25,000 students, continue to explore the cost-benefit analysis in offering 4-year degrees. In more rural communities, community colleges may host branches of the local state university, and community colleges with specialized programs may offer four-year degrees in conjunction with other schools, some miles away. For instance, Southern Illinois University offers aviation management bachelor's degrees at Mt. San Antonio College and Palomar College in Southern California.

Pitch Black Forecast

Pitch Black Forecast is a Groove Metal supergroup formed in 2005 with a lineup consisting of ex-Mushroomhead frontman Jason Popson and ex-Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan and former Integrity bassist Steve Rauckhorst. Formed in Ohio back in 2005 under the name Absentee. They released their debut record Absentee in 2008 featuring guest contributions from Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe and The Human Furnace from Ringworm.
History.
Hoglan and Popson met back in 2004 while Jason was selling T-shirts for Meshuggah while they were on tour with Strapping Young Lad. Popson was taking a break from touring with Mushroomhead where he was known as J Mann. He never mentioned that he was Mushroomhead’s frontman and it wasn't until late in the tour that Hoglan found out. Originally, the group was intended to be similar to Probot with Popson as the vocalist and a revolving door of guitarists and drummers. When Popson was finally ready to record, though, the only one who was not busy was Hoglan. In January 2007, Hoglan flew to Ohio and he and Popson wrote and recorded Absentee in 10 days. Guitarist Rob Reinard (NDE) was brought in by studio engineer Bill Korecky. Bassist Craig Martini was also brought in for the band. Popson and Martini are longtime friends and have performed in bands in the past, including Unified Culture, State of Conviction and The Alter Boys. Shortly after finishing recording "Absentee" Martini left the band in good terms, relocating to Nevada and was replaced by Steve Rauckhorst, who Popson had previously known from the Cleveland scene and his time in Integrity. They played their first show in nearly six months at Peabody's in Cleveland. On May 5, 2011, Pitch Black Forecast announced Tom Shaffner of Keratoma fame would be their new second guitarist. The band's name was originally "Absentee" before switching it to Pitch Black Forecast and using the former as the name of the first album. The first track that was record, which Popson titled "Revolve" and included on his Melvins Tribute album, , was released Popson's record label Fractured Transmitter.
The band's second album, a five-track EP, titled "Burning in Water ... Drowning in Flame" was recorded at Cleveland's Galahad Studios and was released on iTunes on July 18, 2012. The physical release of the album was on Aug. 11, 2012, at a live show for Popson's bands Unified Culture and State of Conviction at Peabody's Down Under in Cleveland. The album features Devin Townsend and M. Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold

Martin of Littlebury

Sir Martin of Littlebury (died 1274) was a British clerk and justice. He was first recorded in 1242 working as a Kings clerk, although it is assumed that he had been previously working for the government as he was, in 1242, awarded the Moiety of a church in Blackburn, and also given a papal indulgence in February 1245. He was most likely a clerk in service to one of the Kings justices, but there is also the possibility that he worked for the clerk of Chancery. Before 1245 he was presented to the parish church at Kirkoswald by Thomas of Moulton, either the Thomas of Moulton who served as a royal justice or his son of the same name. In 1250 he was made Canon of Salisbury Cathedral by William of York, another royal justice.
In the late 1240s Martin served as an occasional Assize Justice, but did not begin full service as a royal justice until the 1260s. In the first half of 1261 he served as a junior justice on three Eyres led by Gilbert of Preston, and became a senior justice on his own Eyre circuit when Eyres resumed in 1262. His final Eyre was in 1263 in Lincolnshire, although the circuit was never completed due to the outbreak of the Second Barons' War. He did not serve during the 1264 reign of Simon de Montford, the "uncrowned King of England", and was not returned to the bench until 1267, when he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. According to official record he was a voice of moderation after the defeat of de Montford at the 1265 Battle of Evesham, calling for provisions to be made for the widows of those who had died and for the wives of noblemen who had survived but been disinherited.
He served as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas until 1272, when on the death of Henry III he was appointed as the Lord Chief Justice, serving less than two years before dying in June 1274.

Marián Aguilera Pérez (born 12 March 1977 in Barcelona, Spain) is a Spanish film and television actress.
Her image was telecast for the world to see when she carried the Olympic flame at Empúries for Barcelona Olympics Games (1992), upon its arrival from Greece. She was 15.
The first film which she starred in was "El Largo Invierno" (1992), at the hands of Jaime Camino. Other highlights of her earlier film titles are "La Cuidad de los Prodigios" (1999), "Quin Curs", "el Meu Tercer!" (1994) (TV) and "Tuna Negro" (2001).
But she is most remembered as Miriam when she starred in "Al Salir de Clase" (1997–1999), a TV series about the lives of a group of teenagers in Madrid. After the series ended, she starred in less successful "Esencia de Poder" (2001–2002) and "Código Fuego" (2003).
"Los Hombres de Paco" / "Paco's Men" (2005–2009) catapulted her into international stardom and fame, with her character Silvia Castro Leon. It created a new fan-base, and countless forums and websites (in many languages) dedicated to her character Silvia and the love story between Silvia and Pepa (portrayed by Laura Sánchez). However, to great dismay of the series and her character’s fans, Marián Aguilera left the show in 2009 to allow herself to grow and explore other possibilities. She re-appeared in the series’ final season a few times as an illusion/imagination (or perhaps a ghost) to Paco.
For her performance in "Los Hombres de Paco", she was nominated Best TV Actress at the 60th Fotogramas de Plata in 2009.

<doc id="19207974" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19207974" title="Wang Jin">
Wang Jin

Wang Jin () (700–782), courtesy name Xiaqing (夏卿), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Daizong. He was a devout Buddhist who encouraged the emperor to become a devout Buddhist as well, but eventually, the corruption by him and the even more powerful chancellor Yuan Zai, with whom he had a long association, drew Emperor Daizong's ire. In 777, Yuan was executed, and Wang was demoted, never to return to the capital Chang'an.
Background.
Wang Jin was born in 700, during the reign of Wu Zetian. His family was originally from Taiyuan, but by the time of Wang Jin was living at Hezhong (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). His great-great-grandfather Wang Ruxian (王儒賢), great-grandfather Wang Zhijie (王知節), and father Wang Chulian (王處廉) all served as military advisors to prefectural prefects, while his grandfather Wang Zhou (王冑) served as a low-level official at the ministry of worship. He had at least four brothers — older brother Wang Wei and younger brothers Wang Chan (王繟), Wang Hong (王紘), and Wang Dan (王紞).
Wang Jin was said to be studious in his youth, and both he and Wang Wei — who would eventually became a well-renowned poet — were both known for their literary talents. Wang Jin passed two special imperial examinations — one for poor provincial scholars, and one for scholars with literary talent.
Early career as imperial official.
After passing the imperial examinations, Wang Jin successively served as "Shiyushi" (侍御史), a low-level imperial censor, and a low-level official at the ministry of defense (武部, "Wubu"). After the general An Lushan rebelled in 755, Wang was selected to be the deputy mayor of Taiyuan Municipality, assisting the general Li Guangbi in defending Taiyuan. It was said that his strategies greatly helped in the defense. During the rebellion (known as the Anshi Rebellion), Wang Wei was captured by the rebels and forced to assume an official post in the rebel state of Yan. After the Anshi Rebellion was largely quelled, Wang Wei was indicted and set to be punished. Wang Jin offered to resign in exchange for his brother's being spared. Wang Wei was then spared, but Wang Jin was only reduced in rank.
Sometime thereafter, Wang Jin was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as the principal of the imperial university (國子祭酒, "Guozi Jijiu"). He later successively served as the mayor of Fengxiang Municipality (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), the deputy minister of public works (工部侍郎, "Gongbu Shilang"), and "Zuo Sanqi Changshi" (左散騎常侍), a high-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng"). When then-reigning Emperor Suzong's father Emperor Xuanzong, then "Taishang Huang" (retired emperor) died in 762, Wang was put in charge of drafting the official mourning text for Emperor Xuanzong, and the work was considered well-written. Thereafter, he was made the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, "Bingbu Shilang"). After the complete end of the Anshi Rebellion (with the death of Yan's final emperor Shi Chaoyi) in 763, Emperor Suzong's son and successor Emperor Daizong (Emperor Suzong's having died as well in 762) sent Wang to survey the former Yan territory. In 764, when the chancellors Liu Yan and Li Xian were removed, Wang and Du Hongjian replaced them — with Wang given the post of "Huangmen Shilang" (黃門侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省, "Menxia Sheng"); director of Taiwei Palace (太微宮); and imperial scholar at Hongwen (弘文館) and Chongxian (崇賢館) Pavilions, in addition to the "de facto" chancellor designation of "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事).
As chancellor.
In 764, when Li Guangbi, who was the deputy supreme commander of Tang forces in the Henan region (i.e., modern Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui) died, Emperor Daizong sent Wang Jin to Luoyang to replace him and to defend Luoyang. It appeared that he soon returned to Chang'an, however, as he was in Chang'an in 766 when the powerful eunuch Yu Chao'en, then the principal of the imperial university, tried to provoke Wang and his fellow chancellor Yuan Zai by, during a lecture about the "I Ching", talking about how a "ding" (a large cooking vessel often used to symbolize chancellorship) would overturn if imbalanced. Wang was visibly incensed, but Yuan remained calm and pleasant, leading Yu to comment, "It is common for the target to get angry, but one who remains smiling needs to be paid attention to even more carefully." He was also at Chang'an in 767, when the general Guo Ziyi visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor, as Emperor Daizong had him, Yuan, and Yu invite Guo to feasts held in Guo's honor.
In 768, when the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), Li Huaixian, who had been ruling his circuit "de facto" independently from the imperial government, was assassinated by his subordinates Zhu Xicai, Zhu Ci, and Zhu Tao, Emperor Daizong tried to take back control of the circuit by sending Wang to Lulong to serve as its military governor. When Wang subsequently arrived at Lulong, Zhu Xicai formally showed him the utmost respect, but had the soldiers be on high alert and did not allow Wang to take actual reign of the circuit. Wang, knowing that he would be unable to wrest control of the circuit from Zhu Xicai, stayed in Lulong only a few days before returning to the Tang capital Chang'an. Subsequently, Zhu Xicai was made acting military governor and, at the end of 768, military governor. Later in 768, when Xin Yunjing (辛雲京) the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan) died, Emperor Daizong sent Wang to Taiyuan to replace him but also had Wang retain all of his other titles. In 769, Wang offered to yield his post as deputy supreme commander and associated military titles, and Emperor Daizong agreed. Meanwhile, while he was at Hedong, the officers Wang Wuzong (王無縱) and Zhang Fengzhang (張奉璋) both believed that since he was a civilian, they could disobey him without consequence. In fall 769, when he ordered them to lead soldiers to the western borders with Tufan to guard against Tufan attacks, Zhang stalled, while Wang Wuzong reentered the city of Taiyuan without permission. He executed them both, and thereafter the officers did not dare to disobey him any further. In 770, he returned to Chang'an.
Throughout the years, Yuan became the leading chancellor at court, particularly after he helped Emperor Daizong kill Yu in 770. It was said that Wang was obedient to Yuan and therefore their relationship remained well, although Wang was known for his arrogance — an arrogance that even Yuan was displeased with. At that time, the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆), which encompassed Chang'an, was Li Gan (黎幹), who was willing to criticize Yuan's governance. On one occasion, when Li was reporting to Wang, Wang insulted Li, who was from Rong Prefecture (戎州, in modern Yibin, Sichuan), by stating, "You are a southern gentleman. What do you know about the protocols at court?"
Wang Jin and his brothers were all devout Buddhists, and Wang himself ate no meat at all. After his wife Lady Li died, he made his mansion into a Buddhist temple known as Baoying Temple (寶應寺), to seek blessings for Lady Li. It was said that whenever regional governors arrived at Chang'an, he would take them on a tour of Baoying Temple in order to pressure them into donating to the temple. Due to the influence of not only Wang, but also Yuan and Du (who died in 769 — after first taking tonsure), who were both Buddhists as well, Emperor Daizong also became a devout Buddhist and came under the deep belief that if he remained devout, whatever disasters the empire suffered would not destroy the empire. He thus ordered that Buddhist monks and nuns not be punished for any reason, and that many temples be built. As a result of the emperor's and the chancellors' devotion to Buddhism, many officials became Buddhists as well, and the "Book of Tang" attributed the lack of accomplishments by the imperial administration during Emperor Daizong's reign to this.
By 777, it was said that both Yuan and Wang were exceedingly corrupt, and while Emperor Daizong tolerated them, he was becoming displeased. In 777, he had his uncle, the general Wu Cou (吳湊), arrest them. They were interrogated by a panel of five officials, including Liu Yan and Li Han (李涵). Yuan was executed. Originally, Wang was to be sentenced to forced suicide, but at Liu's suggestion — pointing out that Wang was less culpable than Yuan — Emperor Daizong spared Wang's life and demoted him to be the prefect of Kuo Prefecture (括州, in modern Lishui, Zhejiang).
After demotion.
In 779, Wang Jin was given the honorary position of staff member for Emperor Daizong's crown prince Li Kuo, but was not allowed to return to Chang'an; rather, he was ordered to settle in at Luoyang. He died around new year 782, early in Li Kuo's reign (as Emperor Dezong).

Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1864

The following engagements took place in the year 1864 during the American Civil War. The Union armies, under the command of U.S. Grant, launched multiple offenses in all theaters of the war, in an attempt to prevent Confederate forces from transferring troops from one army to another.
History.
In March, Ulysses S. Grant was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed general-in-chief of the Union Army. He decided on a strategy of simultaneous offenses in the Eastern, Western, and Trans-Mississippi Theaters in order to grind down and ultimately defeat the Confederate armies. Grant himself planned to travel with the Army of the Potomac, commanded by George G. Meade, and the IX Corps, commanded by Ambrose Burnside, both to coordinate the two forces and to avoid the politics of Washington, D.C. (Burnside was senior to Meade and therefore would have the right to command the Army of the Potomac, so in order to retain Meade Grant had both commanders report to him. Grant concluded on May 25 that this command structure was unwiedly and placed Burnside under Meade's command.) In the Eastern Theater, Grant's forces fought General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in a series of battles that became known as the Overland Campaign from May to June. Although he lost heavily during the campaign and failed to gain a tactical advantage in any of the battles, Grant inflicted a larger percentage of casualties on Lee than the Union army incured and also forced Lee into retreating closer to Richmond. Following the Battle of Cold Harbor, Grant crossed the James River and attack the city of Petersburg, which was a vital rail center for Lee's supply lines to North Carolina. Several Union attacks on the Confederate defenses near the city in early June resulted in failure; as a result, Grant settled into a nine-month siege at Petersburg, during which he continued to move westward in order to cut Lee's supply lines.
Grant planned for two other campaigns in the Eastern Theater: the Army of the James commanded by Major General Benjamin Butler landed on the Bermuda Hundred peninsula near Petersburg, with orders to cut the Richmond & Petersburg Railroad and to prevent reinforcements from reaching Lee's army. After building fortifications on the peninsula, Butler made several advances towards the railroad, each time retreating back to his fortifications after a brief skirmish with Confederate forces. Following the Battle of Ware Bottom Church, the Confederates built a line of fortifications parallel to the Union lines, bottling up Butler's force and allowing reinforcements to be detached to Lee.
In the Shenandoah Valley, another Union force commanded by Major General Franz Sigel advanced southward until he encountered a small Confederate force commanded by Major General John C. Breckinridge at the Battle of New Market on May 15, which resulted in a Confederate victory. Sigel was replaced by David Hunter, who started his campaign near the end of May. His victory at Piedemont on June 5 caused to Lee to detach his Second Corps, under Lieutenant General Jubal Early, to the Valley to deal with the Union forces. Hunter attacked Early's command at Lynchburg but was defeated; Hunter then retreated through West Virginia to the Ohio River, allowing Early to move north through the Valley. Early then launched a raid on Washington, D.C., but due to the delay caused by the Battle of Monocacy failed to arrive at the city before Union reinforcements did, making a successful attack impossible. Early was then able to retreat back into the Shenandoah Valley with the supplies his army had seized and from there launched several additional small raids which the local Union commanders were unable to prevent. To deal with these raids and combat the Confederate forces in the Valley effectively, Grant consolidated the various military departments in the area into the Middle Military Division, commanded by Philip H. Sheridan. During a three-month campaign, Sheridan successfully destroyed both the Confederate fighting capabilities in the Shenandoah and the supplies the Confederates needed to feed Lee's army at Petersburg.
In the Western Theater, Union forces were placed in the Military Division of the Mississippi, commanded by Major General William T. Sherman, who had orders to capture Atlanta. During the three-month Atlanta Campaign, Sherman outflanked Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee out of one position after another until the two forces reached Atlanta. Fearing he would abandon the city without a fight, Confederate President Jefferson Davis replaced Johnston with John B. Hood, who launched a series of attacks on Sherman's armies, which each time failed with heavy Confederate casualties. When Sherman cut the Montgomery & Atlanta Railroad in early September, the Confederate supply lines into the city were cut and Hood was forced to abandon Atlanta. For the next two months, Hood and Sherman skirmished as Hood attempted to cut Sherman's supply lines to the North; Sherman eventually gave up trying to catch Hood and instead embarked on his Savannah campaign. Hood, instead of following Sherman, moved north into Tennessee, intending to capture Nashville before going into Kentucky. He lost heavily in a frontal attack at the Battle of Franklin on November 30, suffering over 7,000 casualties including thirteen generals killed, wounded, or captured; this left him with too few men to overrun the Union fortifications at Nashville, so Hood instead constructed fortifications a few miles to the south and tried to entice the Unio commander, Major General George H. Thomas, to attack him. On December 15–16, Thomas did attack, routing most of the Confederate army on both days and capturing over 70 cannons and 15,000 prisoners. Hood retreated back to Alabama, where he was relieved of command by his own request; the Army of Tennessee was reduced to barely 20,000 men by casualties and desertions during the retreat.
In the Trans-Mississippi Theater, Major General Nathaniel P. Banks led his Army of the Gulf up the Red River in Louisiana, intending to invade eastern Texas and to seize cotton to supply the New England cotton mills. The Confederate commander of the District of Western Louisiana, Major General Richard Taylor, steadily retreated until both forces neared Mansfield, where on April 7, Taylor attacked and routed Banks' force; another battle was fought the next day near Pleasant Hill but the Confederates were defeated. Banks continued retreating along the river until he reached the Red River's confluence with the Mississippi. A simultaneous campaign from Union controlled northern Arkansas was launched, which was planned to link up with Banks' force at Shreveport, Louisiana, but was turned back due to a lack of supplies.

Haiti at the Paralympics

Haiti first participated in the Paralympic Games in 2008, sending a single athlete, Nephtalie Jean-Louis, to compete in powerlifting. Due to unspecified "problems with her weight", however, Jean-Louis was ultimately unable to compete, and was listed as a non-starter in her event (powerlifting).
Thus it is only at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London that Haitian athletes actually competed for the first time. The country was represented by two athletes: Nephtalie Jean-Louis, in the shot put and javelin rather than in powerlifting; and Josue Cajuste, also in the shot put and javelin.
Haiti's participation in the Paralympics is overseen by the "Comité National Paralympique d'Haïti".

Dapper Denver Dooley

Dapper Denver Dooley is a Walter Lantz character and Woody Woodpecker's rival. He was voiced by Dallas McKennon.
History.
Dapper Denver Dooley first appeared in the cartoon "Square Shootin' Square" in 1955. Dooley returns in 1957 to 1959 cartoons "Box Car Bandit", "Dopey Dick the Pink Whale", "Misguided Missile", "Half Empty Saddles", "Jittery Jester", "Yukon Have It" (Chilly Willy cartoon), "Panhandle Scandal" and "The Tee Bird".

Gert

Gert (typically ) is a mainly masculine given name with some female bearers. English-speaking people should note that the "d-sound" as in "jungle" should not be present, only the "j" should be heard which take some practice. To make a distinction from the German and Dutch name, Gert is almost never pronounced with a g as in those languages and never spelled Geert as in Dutch. The Dutch name has no relation to Gert. Furthermore, Geert in Dutch is pronounced with a guttural phoneme, non-existent in Nordic languages. In Denmark the name is pronounced "girt" with a clear i-sound to make a distinction from the German and Dutch names. In Norway the name is extremely rare but usually spelled Gjert to mark the j-sound in the pronunciation as in Swedish. It is a short form of the name "Gerhard". The name's meaning, derived from the German and Norse translation, is 'the stern javelin warrior'. Since 1993 no-one in Sweden has been baptised as Gert according to the Swedish Bureau of Census, so the name is becoming increasingly rare. 2010 around 12 000 in Sweden had the name as their first name according to the same source. Gert is most common in Sweden among males over 50 years of age. Around 400 females in Sweden have Gert as their first name.

Eolacertilia ("dawn lizards") is an extinct clade of lepidosauriform diapsid reptiles known from the Late Permian to the Late Triassic. It is uncertain as to whether they are a natural group and it has been suggested that they form a "waste basket" taxon. Currently, the only members of the group are "Paliguana" and Kuehneosauridae. Other genera were transferred to basal groups within Diapsida (such as "Palaeagama" and "Saurosternon"), Archosauromorpha ("Tanystropheus" and "Cteniogenys") and even Sauropodomorpha ("Fulengia").

Michel Guérard

Michel Guérard (born 27 March 1933, Vétheuil, Val-d'Oise) is a French chef, author, one of the founders of "nouvelle cuisine", and the inventor of "cuisine minceur".
Biography.
Guérard served his apprenticeship at the patisserie of Kleber Alix, in Mantes-La-Jolie. He worked at a number of Parisian restaurants, including "Maxim's", and in 1958 won the Meilleur Ouvrier de France Patisserie, while working as a pastry chef at the "Hôtel de Crillon". He also worked at "Le Lido".
In 1965 Guérard opened a restaurant in Paris called "Le Pot-au-Feu", which in 1967 earned Guérard his first star in the Michelin Guide. The restaurant gained a second star in 1971, and was successful until it was compulsorily acquired for the purposes of a road-widening.
In 1972 Guérard met Christine Barthelemy, the daughter of the founder of the Biotherm range and the owner of a chain of spas and hotels. They married, and in 1974 he moved with her to Eugénie-les-Bains, where she was running one of her family's smaller, less successful spas. They restored the buildings, and Guérard invented a style of food, cuisine minceur, a form of healthy cooking, designed to lure health-conscious Parisians to travel the 800 km to Eugénie. In 1977 his main restaurant received three Michelin stars, and all his properties in Eugénie have been very successful, transforming the tiny village into a significant tourist destination.
In 1983 Christine and Michel purchased the Château de Bachen, replanting the vineyards, and producing their first harvest in 1988.

Box hockey

Box hockey is an active hand game played between two people with sticks, a puck and a compartmented box (typically long), and typically played outdoors. The object of the game is to move a hockey puck through the center dividers, of the box, out through a hole placed at each end of the box, also known as the goal. The two players face one another on either side of the box, and each attempts to move the puck to their left. If a player succeeds in getting the puck to exit the box through the goal, the player scores one point (or goal). The first player to score the predetermined number of goals wins the game.
History.
Box hockey has little known origin, but the game has been around since at least the late 19th century, as described in various game books, such as "Games for the Playground, Home, School and Gym" (Jessie H. Bancroft, 1913) and "400 Games for School, Home, and Playground" (F.A. Owen Pub. Co., 1920). 
Box Hockey was listed as the "Game of the Month" as published in the 1914 Volume 2 of the "Recreational helps" by the New York State College of Agriculture Department of Rural Sociology with the following description:
"Box hockey is an excellent active game for picnics camps and playgrounds. It can also be adapted to indoor recreation if the floor upon which it is played is well padded with old rugs to prevent being damaged with the hockey sticks." 
"Equipment: Take two pieces of lumber 2 inches by by , and two [end pieces 1 inches by 10 inches by 4 foot [] and construct a rectangular box fastening it together with spike nails or wagon bed rods. Take another board 2 inches by and nail it into the rectangular frame, dividing it into two equal compartments. On the bottom side of the box, cut a hole in the center of each of the end boards, and cut two such holes in the bottom of the dividing board, which make the two equal compartments. These last two holes should be equidistant from the sides of the box. Now get a couple of and an old baseball and you are ready to play. Almost any kind of a stick will do. Saplings cut off underneath the ground so as to get the curve are very good. Also cheap commercial hockey sticks with the blade reinforced with vtirc are excellent." 
Around 1937, Milton Bradley sold a box hockey game (model No. 4125). By the late 1930s and into the 1940s, it was not uncommon for towns to host youth box hockey tournaments, such as in Reading, Pennsylvania, where the winners of the Essick Playground and Oakbrook were reported by the local newspaper in the July 11, 1939, July 4, 1941 and June 29, 1949 issues of the "Reading Eagle".
By the 1950s, Sears & Roebuck was selling a mass-produced version of box hockey for 50 cents. In the mid-1950s adult box hockey clubs in Eugene, Oregon battled for the title "Springfield Box Hockey service club champions". 
In the mid-1950s, Larry Best, Director of Recreation for the Milton Hershey School for Boys in Hershey, PA (the Milton Hershey School was established in 1909 by Milton S. Hershey), in search of an activity that would be healthy, active and fun for the students, became aware of the game BOX HOCKEY and introduced it to the students as part of their summer recreation program. Individual play as well as school tournaments were promoted, and Box Hockey is still an active program at the school with almost 75 student homes (approx. 16 students per home) each having a game set today, manufactured by Box Hockey International, Inc. ( www.BOX-HOCKEY.com ).
World Wide Games, Inc. in Delaware, Ohio, manufactured the suitcase-style hockey box in 1965; one is on display at the Elliott Avedon Museum & Archive of Games.
In the mid-1970s to early 1980s, box hockey had a major resurgence in the United States, as a part of the dramatic increase in funding and staffing in municipal recreation and parks departments across the country to reduce youth crime and violence that was prevalent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, by providing activities to keep teenagers active and social.
In 1994, Andy Brody founded Box Hockey International and started to market and mass-produce the larger floor version. This variant of the game features multiple walls with staggered "house holes" through which the puck must be passed to reach either goal. Today, many children play the larger floor version in summer camps throughout the upper part of North America, such as Triumphant Life Camp in Larabee Valley, California, Wilderness Northwest on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state, and Shady Hollow Campground in Brainerd, Minnesota. Box hockey is also used for agility training in hockey schools and camps throughout Canada and the U.S.
Handmade suitcase-style box hockey games are still available at crafts events like the Lowell Folk Festival in Lowell, Massachusetts. Each year they also have a dozen or so set up for playing during the festivities.

Glastening

Glastening (or "Glastenning") refers to an old Welsh pedigree mentioned by William of Malmesbury possibly associated with Glastonbury.
Associated genealogies.
Modern and medieval historians have sought to associate various versions of the same Old Welsh pedigree with Glastonbury. The earliest genealogy is a 10th-century text, the Harleian Genealogies, preserved in London, British Library, Harleian MS 3859, which ends with Glast and states "unum sunt Glastenic qui uenerunt que uocatur Loytcoyt", or "one of those who came to Glastenning from the place called Luit-Coyt" (modern Lichfield). 
Other versions are given in the later "Achau Brenhinoedd a Thywysogion Cymru" and William of Malmesbury's "De antiquitate Glastonie ecclesie", where the pedigree is listed as brothers. From the versions it not clear whether Glast was a personal name or a kindred group as Glastening, "descendants of Glasten", or an epithet "Glas" meaning "the Blue, Green or Grey".
In literature.
The Glastening may be connected in some way to the Sumorsaete, an obscure Anglo-Saxon group who may have given their name to Somerset. According to William of Malmesbury, Glast was one of twelve brothers who migrated from the north to assume control of parts of Wales (the Britons still held much of the west of Britain) who were great-grandsons of Cunedda. He settled in Glastonbury with his livestock after finding it deserted. The 14th century codex from Oxford, Bodleian Library, Jesus College 20, actually gives Glas map Elno (or Elnaw) as the great-grandson of Cunedda.
David Thornton finds "no strong evidence" for the association of the pedigree of the Glastening with Glastonbury other than the similarity of the names. He concludes that the Glastening had an association with Lichfield (problems of textual corruption making it difficult to be precise about the relationship) and that "their sojourn in Glastonbury, however, is the product of medieval pseudo-historical thought supported by the zealous ingenuity of subsequent scholars."
It is unclear when Glastonbury was first established, but it is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th centuries, as "Glestingaburg". The "burg" element is Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure. However the "Glestinga" element is obscure, and may derive from an Old English word or from a Saxon or Celtic personal name.

Eugène-Louis Doyen (December 16, 1859 – November 21, 1916) was a French surgeon who was a native of Reims. He was the son of Octave Doyen (1831–1895), who served as mayor of Reims.
Eugène Doyen studied medicine in Reims and Paris, and later opened a private medical institute in Paris that attracted a wealthy clientele. Doyen was a skilled and innovative physician who introduced several surgical techniques and medical instruments, some of which bear his name today. He was a pioneer in the use of electrosurgery and electrocoagulation, and also marketed a yeast extract he called "mycolysine" for treatment of infectious diseases.
He had a keen interest in photography and cinematography, and performed early experiments of color film, microcinematography and stereoscopic film. He produced numerous films of operations, including a craniectomy, an abdominal hysterectomy, and a surgery for separation of conjoined twins united in the area of the xiphoid process of the sternum. Although his films were popular at medical conferences abroad, they were harshly criticized by his contemporaries in France, who felt that the integrity of their profession had been compromised.
For a period of time, Doyen was editor-in-chief of the "Revue Critique de Médecine et de Chirurgie", as well as the "Archives de Doyen", a medico-surgical journal of the Doyen Institute.

Estômago (Portuguese for "stomach"), or Estômago, a Gastronomic Story, is a 2007 Brazilian–Italian film directed by Marcos Jorge. The film won several awards.
Plot.
The film shows in parallel two periods in the life of Raimundo Nonato (João Miguel): one follows his successful career as a cook, the other as a prisoner in a cell with about ten other convicts. It gradually becomes clear that these events happen after the former.
His period as a cook starts when he arrives by bus in a big city, without a place to sleep nor money for food. After eating chicken snacks in a cafetaria, he has to wash the dishes to pay for it and is eventually offered a job, receiving merely food and lodging as payment, even though the snacks he cooks are so good it attracts more customers. Nonato falls in love with Íria, a gluttonous prostitute, who offers her services in exchange for food. He also gets a better job in an Italian restaurant, where he learns more of cooking from his boss Giovanni. One day he finds Giovanni having sex with Íria, despite he having proposed to her earlier. Enraged, he steals and drinks from his boss' prized wine collection, before murdering them both and cannibalizing a slice of meat removed from Íria's buttocks.
In the prison cell there is a power hierarchy with Bujiú (Babu Santana) at the top. The food is poor, and Nonato is assigned to cook better food. The inmates are usually quite satisfied with it, and Nonato rises in the hierarchy. However, Bujiú rejects Gorgonzola, raw meat, and cooked ants, much to Raimundo's frustration. When top-criminal Etcetera, who is highly regarded the inmates, arrives,Bujiú decides that a great meal should be cooked to please him. The main prison kitchen is arranged for the occasion, an event which Nonato takes advantage of to poison Bujiú, ultimately leading to him becoming the leader of his cell.

Cyclone Graham

Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone season was a weak tropical storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated from an area of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an area of low pressure that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.
Meteorological history.
On 23 February 2003, an area of convection that was situated over land for roughly a week emerged over open waters along the northern coast of Australia. The strengthening of a deep, persistent monsoon trough contributed to cyclogenesis, and a low pressure area formed. By 25 February, the low developed a banding feature in which the highest winds were located. Though the storm was located in an area of unfavorable wind shear, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) began to issue gale warnings on the system at 0100 UTC the next day, while the low was located several hundred miles north-northeast of Port Hedland. The disturbance was initially nearly stationary as it showed signs of organization due to relaxed shear, and at 0700 UTC on 27 February, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone Graham, as it had attained 80 km/h (50 mph) 10-minute maximum sustained winds. The first warning was issued on Graham later that day.
Initially exhibiting characteristics of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge to the south of Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, though at the same time the BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.
The storm made landfall at Western Australia's Eighty Mile Beach at 1400 UTC on 28 February, and began to weaken. The storm had dissipated on 1 March; the BoM issued their last advisory on the cyclone at 0400 UTC that day, while similarly, the JTWC issued their last advisory just two hours later. The storm's remnants died out in the country's desert.
Impact.
In advance of the cyclone, the communities of Wallal, Sandfire, Punmu and Telfer were put on alert. A warning was issued for Bidyadanga, Pardoo and Cotton Creek. The storm's landfall in Western Australia brought heavy rainfall and high winds. The storm dropped of rain at Telfer in one night, over half the town's annual average; total rainfall reached there. The heavy rain caused flooding and road closures, and swelled a river passing through Fitzroy Crossing, though the river only topped its banks slightly. Near that town, at Blue Bush Creek, while a group of people attempted to cross floodwaters, two men were swept away. Both men were rescued, though one died before emergency services arrived. In addition to the flooding, a number of trees were downed. No significant damages were reported.
Following the storm, the name Graham was retired from the Australian region basin.

They started as a part of the Leaveners, a Quaker performing arts group, alongside their other two groups, Quaker Music Making and Quaker Youth Theatre. After gaining popularity at various events, such as the Big Youth Theatre Festival (BYTF) and receiving the Wavemakers Award, the youth theatre split from its parent organisation due to financial issues, becoming and Independent Voluntary Organisation. The group formerly met at the Crescent Theatre before September 2008, when the group moved to the Hippodrome.
Organisation.
Words, Signs & Vibes is led primarily by two drama leaders, Angela Twigg and Jayne Fletcher, who after working as drama leaders while the group was a member of the Leaveners, since moved to save the group from disbanding by forming it into an independent organisation in its own right.
The drama leaders are helped in workshops and projects by volunteer workers and interpreters to aid with communication with sign language.

Dogana

Dogana is a town and a civil parish ("curazia") in the north-eastern corner of San Marino in the Serravalle municipality ("castle"). The town is the most populated settlement in the republic.
Geography.
The town is situated at the northernmost point of San Marino after Falciano, close to the borders with Italy (at Cerasolo Ausa, a "frazione" of Coriano, in the province of Rimini).
History.
It has a population of roughly 7,000. Due to its size, in 2006 it has asked to split away from Serravalle and become its own "castello", but in 2007 the proposal was refused. A partial autonomy is reflected in Dogana's having its own postal code (47891), while the rest of Serravalle carries the designation 47899.
Economy.
Dogana is the main entry point for travellers arriving into San Marino from Italy (by freeway no. 72 from Rimini). Although "Dogana" means "customs house" in Italian, there are no border formalities anywhere on the border between Italy and San Marino, so the motorists may stop in Dogana only to shop at one of its shopping malls.
Sport.
The local football team is the Juvenes.

Last Friends

The series follow the life of Michiru Aida, a beauty parlor assistant who returns to Tokyo after 4 years. Bullied by her seniors at work and abused by her boyfriend, she is reunited with her best friend during high school, Ruka Kishimoto, a skilled motocross racer. Takeru, a make-up artist, is introduced to Ruka by her housemate, Eri and thus begin a journey of friendship.
A manga counterpart focusing on Ruka's and Michiru's high school days is currently being published in Malika. Although episode 11 was supposed to be the final episode, a sudden phone call requested the producers to add on a special. A movie has also been announced due to Last Friends' immense popularity.
Last Friends was number 1 on Fuji's top 50 list from June 16 till June 29. However, it had since dropped to 6th place after the broadcast of the special and as of the week of July 7 to 13, Last Friends ranked 9th on the Top 50 list. Aside from the official website at Fuji TV, another website has also been created, named "Last Friends: Another".
Creation and conception.
Juri Ueno and Masami Nagasawa were originally approached for the role of Ruka and Michiru. Asami Mizukawa was cast for the other woman character Taeko Asano planned to have in the drama. Takeru, however was a last minute addition because the producers wanted a male presence in the drama. Initially the drama, was to be only about domestic violence (DV) and gender identity disorder portrayed by Nagasawa and Ueno respectively. A character who used DV was then created.
Ueno was picked by Asano, who saw her performance in Rainbow Song. According to Asano, it was her intuition which said Ueno was perfect for the role of Ruka Kishimoto, a character with gender identity issues. Eita was cast because of his "feminine feel". Nagasawa was selected because Asano thought of her as the "smiling woman who worries".
Takeru's friendship with Ruka was in the "grey zone". Asano stated that Ueno was very enthusiastic about her role from the beginning, asking about the hairstyle and clothing when she accepted the role.
Theme.
Centered around the current generation's problem, Last Friends follow the various issues, most notably of domestic violence, gender identity disorder and trauma. Each of the five characters are represented by an issue, which are:
Synopsis.
Michiru Aida is a beauty parlour assistant who returns to Tokyo after four years of absence. She moves in with her boyfriend, Sousuke Oikawa, who works in the Child Welfare Division. She quickly becomes the victim of DV and is bullied at her workplace. Ruka Kishimoto is Michiru's best friend that works part-time at a mechanic shop and is a brilliant motocross racer. She has a problem which she cannot confide to anyone and her worry becomes evident throughout the series. Takeru Mizhushima is a professional hair makeup artist by day and a bartender by night who suffers from a traumatic past. The three meet by chance and a journey of friendship begins.
Plot.
A pregnant Michiru is first seen walking in a fishing village area, wondering about her friends and a horrible death which occurred laments the fact that she did not have the ability to know what is in a person's heart, and therefore could not stop the death. However, she acknowledges that her friends are supporting her even though she betrayed Ruka.
Present day Tokyo, Michiru is working at a beauty parlour when she sees her boyfriend, Sousuke Oikawa waving at her and pointing out a place to meet him for dinner. When she does, Sousuke gives her a cup for her birthday present and invites her to live together. Michiru gets permission from her mother and tells Sousuke that she will move in soon, first buying pair furniture. At the department store, Michiru is seen by Ruka, who chases the bus Michiru has boarded. In her hurry, Ruka bumps into Takeru and drops her cup. She catches up, and the two meet each other for the first time in four years. Later that day, Ruka meets Takeru again after Eri drags her along to the night bar where Takeru works.
Cast.
Main characters.
Michiru Aida is a beauty parlour assistant who gets constantly bullied at her workplace "Niche" by her seniors. Her mother doesn't care about her much, even forgetting her 22nd birthday. She moves in with her boyfriend Sousuke; who is the only one who she can confide her emotional problems to but becomes the victim of domestic violence.
She was Ruka's best friend in middle school and has not seen her for four years after her mother moved them to a relative's place in Choushi. Michiru graduated from high school in 2003.
After returning to Tokyo, she is spotted by Ruka while shopping for new furniture in accordance with moving in with Sousuke. The two then spend time catching up at a park which holds precious memories to each of them. In the past, Michiru would tell Ruka all of her family problems at the very same park, eat ice cream and take shelter from the rain there. When she returns to Sousuke's apartment, she is slapped because Sousuke thought that the messages that Michiru was receiving from Ruka was from a guy. Failing to find the graduation album in her house, Michiru returns and gets slapped again and promises to find it. When she returns to her house again, she sees her mother with another guy, so she decides to go to the park. Ruka finds Michiru by instinct after receiving a miss call from her, and brings Michiru back to the Share House. They spend the night there and after Ruka sees Michiru crying in her sleep, Ruka kisses Michiru.
She gives Ruka a good luck charm for the race, which Ruka considers to be the thing which saved her during the accident which occurred during the race when her bike flipped over. After the accident, Michiru nearly gets attacked by Sousuke until Ruka turns up and yells at Sousuke not to touch "my Michiru".
After being raped by Sousuke, Michiru moves out of the ShareHouse and isolates herself from everyone else. She goes back to Choushi, where nine months later, she is about to give birth. However, complications arises when it is discovered she has abnormal high blood pressure that can endanger both her child and herself. She manages to pull through and names the child "Rumi", Ru from Ruka and Mi from Michiru. Ru is also present in Takeru.
Taeko Asano has stated that Michiru and Ruka were not based on Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon characters Michiru and Haruka despite rumors.
A brilliant motocross racer, Ruka Kishimoto was Michiru's best friend since middle school. When she meets Michiru after four years, she is delighted yet worried about it. She dislikes people discriminating against gender, like her motocross senior does. She comments that when she is racing and in the air, "everything disappears" and "you become a thing floating in air" regardless of gender. Ruka lives in the Share House with Eri.
Her main problem throughout the series is confessing her love for Michiru. There are moments where it is obvious that Ruka loves Michiru, yet Michiru doesn't see it. Sousuke describes Ruka looking at Michiru with "male like eyes". Her relationship with Takeru is different. While Takeru loves Ruka, Ruka treats him like a friend. Her father even states that Takeru looks "weak", much to Ruka's amusement.
In the past, she and Michiru often got in trouble with the patrol man for riding together on a single seat bicycle. They would stay at a park where Michiru would confide to her about her family problems, and Ruka would stay with her because she "couldn't leave her in tears". Ruka graduated from high school in 2003.
Her motocross number is #27. While initially looked down upon by her male senior, Ruka eventually wins the Kanto Motocross Competition. Ueno started training for the motocross scenes in February, and she commented that the bike was really heavy as it weighs 90 kg.
Taeko Asano commented that Ueno Juri "changed" her image from the Nodame Cantabile hairstyle to Ruka's clothing and hair style right before rehearsal. Asano also commented that "she's a natural genius" and that she became "the character itself" because Ueno changed her habits of walking, talking and sitting to emulate Ruka's style, even when the camera's were not in action. Ueno stated that the role of "Ruka" was starting to have an effect on her.
Asano has also stated that Michiru and Ruka were not based on Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon characters Michiru and Haruka despite rumors.
A professional makeup and hair artist by day and a bartender by night, Takeru suffers from a trauma acquired during his childhood. As such, he is uncomfortable around women, except Ruka, whom he has fallen in love with. Many, including Eri at first, suspect him as gay because of his good looks yet the absence of a girlfriend.
When he was a child, his father was abusive but his mother remained by his side. His sister wanted an ally that would not betray her and used Takeru. It is not stated what happened between him and his step sister, but because of it, Takeru suffers from trauma and is afraid of a woman's body.
Takeru is injured badly because Sousuke thought he was the object of Michiru's affection. Due to the injury sustained, he loses his job.
However when Michiru disappears, Takeru drags Ruka along to "fill her heart". They meet Michiru at the hospital after a minor accident, and after she gives birth, Takeru tells the baby that he will be the father.
An air stewardess, Eri is a happy go lucky woman who often finds herself miserable at love. She is the only original member of the ShareHouse other than Ruka prior to the main story. Eri loves to drink, and can speak various words in different languages due to her experience at work.
Eri often speaks whatever is on her mind, even guessing Ruka's feelings towards Michiru. When Ruka denies this, saying that she treats everyone fairly, Eri also denies her statement because she felt that she was treated differently although Eri is Ruka's housemate. She regrets that she didn't know about Ruka's GID issue until after Ruka wins the motocross race.
When Ogurin tells her that he is leaving for Milan due to a transfer, she gets angry with him for apologizing. However, when she goes to work, Ogurin turns up with a bunch of roses, asking her to marry him. She marries Ogurin despite him being good for nothing, insinuating that her love is enough for both of them. Both of them move out of the ShareHouse due to Ogurin's transfer to Italy, but return eventually after a year for a reunion.
Sousuke Oikawa is Michiru's boyfriend who works in the Children's Welfare department. He abuses Michiru and seems to suffer from multiple personalities, once slapping her then apologizing and
hugging the next moment. He beats up Takeru as he mistakenly assumes that Takeru was the guy Ruka said that Michiru liked. Sousuke also nearly rapes Ruka, but Ruka manages to get away at the last minute by smashing a lamp into him.
The only relationship he has besides being Michiru's boyfriend is with a young boy who he rescues from an abusive parent. He saves the child's life from an oncoming train, breaking several of his bones in the process.
When he was 10, Sousuke was raised by various relatives after his mother ran away with a customer at the supermarket where she had worked. It is because of this that Sousuke wanted to marry Michiru and raise a happy family.
Sousuke commits suicide at the end of the series because he felt he could not give Michiru the happiness she found with the ShareHouse members. He writes her a letter, explaining his actions and how he understood that the only way to set Michiru free was to kill himself.
Masami Nagasawa, who played opposite Nishikido as Michiru, stated that "his type of acting is more difficult than mine. He also worries about me being hit accidentally."
Supporting characters.
Tomohiko Ogura
Tomohiko Ogura is Eri's senior at their workplace. He has an estranged relationship with his wife Eiko and decides to move into the ShareHouse while he finds a way to solve his problem. He is often called "Ogurin". Ogurin is very cowardly sometimes, unable to stand up for himself or worry a lot about his wellbeing.
He realizes that he has been in love with Eri all along, and marries her. They both move out of the ShareHouse due to Ogurin's transfer to Italy, but return eventually after a year.
Michiru's mother, she is often drunk and very careless. She gambles and borrows money often, leading to financial burdens on Michiru. At the start of the drama, she finds a new lover which makes Michiru irritated. When Chinatsu needed money to pay of some debts, Sousuke offers her some and in return she tells him of Michiru's location.
Takeru's sister. Their past is vaguely shown, but it is clear that she did something to Takeru which made him fear a woman's body.
Hayashida is Ruka's motocross senior. Often looking down on women, Hayashida believes that it is almost impossible for a woman to reach the speed and level of a male racer. He once tried to hit on her, but Ruka manages to ward him off.
Shogo is Ruka's younger brother. The Kishimoto family is very supportive of Ruka.
Setting.
The drama takes place in modern day Tokyo.
The ShareHouse is a house where members share the rent (40000 yen per person) amongst themselves.

The members share the facilities, such as the toilet, kitchen and living room, but each of them have their own rooms. Eri lets Ogurin into her room at times.
The Inokashira Park is another notable setting. When Michiru and Ruka were in high school, they used to go to the park and spend time there. Michiru and Ruka reminisce about their high school days when they meet after four years. After Michiru was beaten up by Sousuke, Ruka finds her in the park.

<doc id="19208444" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19208444" title="Memiljeon">
Memiljeon

Memiljeon is a variety of "jeon" or Korean style pancake, which is made from buckwheat and a couple of vegetables or kimchi. It is a traditional local specialty of Gangwon Province, where buckwheat is extensively cultivated due to the mountainous conditions and cold temperature. Especially "memiljeon" of Pyeongchang and Jeongseon County are famous along with "memilmuk" (buckwheat jelly) and "memil guksu" (buckwheat noodles), both of which are also made from the grain. The locals of the region prepare the dish for special occasions such as "jesa", a Korean ancestor veneration ritual. Whenever the farmers' market called "Pyeongchang Market" is held in Pyeongchang every five days, merchants specializing in making "memiljeon" are numerous, as "memiljeon" has been gaining a popularity in South Korea these days.
Preparation.
The batter is prepared by mixing buckwheat flour and water to a thin consistency and sometimes a small amount of wheat flour or starch can be added to it because buckwheat itself has less glutinous elements. In a traditional way, buckwheat mixed with water is ground by millstone and the batter is strained through a sieve. The filtered batter is cooked on a "sodang" (소당) which is the lid of a "sot" (솥, a traditional big pot) and used for pan-frying. Several pieces of vertically ripped salted napa cabbage and scallions are put on the heated "sodang", and the batter is poured over them from their margin. Sour kimchi can be replaced with the cabbage. When making the "memiljeon", the batter should be poured thinly because thick "memiljeon" is considered less delicious. Perilla oil is used to cook the dish.
Foods made with "memiljeon".
"Memiljeon" can be an ingredient to make other dishes such as "memil chongtteok" (메밀총떡) or also called "memil jeonbyeong" (메밀전병). The dish is formed like a dumpling or wrap stuffed with any available ingredient according to recipe, taste, or region. In the Jeju region, the dish is called "bingtteok" (빙떡) or "Jejudo bindaetteok" and stuffed with boiled shredded daikon. The fillings commonly used in Gangwon Province are "japchae" (noodle salad), or shredded sour kimchi, daikon, scallions, garlic, and pork or squid which are seasoned and stir-fried alogether. In the Pyeongchang region, half transparent noodles called "cheonsachae" (천사채), which are made from kombu, are especially used. The dish is considered a good "anju" because the combination of the savory and a bit blend taste from "memiljeon"' and pungent taste from the inner makes a good companion for drinking alcoholic beverages.

Government House of Thailand

The Government House (; ) is the offices of the Prime Minister of Thailand and the appointed cabinet ministers. It also contains conference rooms and is used for state functions and receptions of foreign guests. It consists of several palace-like structures extending over . King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) commissioned the Italian architect Annibale Rigotti to design the main building in 1923, although construction would remain incomplete as Rigotti returned to Italy after the king's death in 1925. Initially intended as a family residence for one of the king's favorite generals, the building became the Prime Minister's seat in 1941. Prime Minister Plaek Pibulsonggram then assigned Italian sculptor and artist Corrado Feroci to complete the construction (also working on the building at this point was the architect Ercole Manfredi). The main building carries a golden dome housing a statue of Phra Phrom (Brahma) and its façade resembles that of the Ca' d'Oro Palazzo in Venice.
During the 2008 Thai political crisis, anti-government protesters besieged the Government House. After a court order, they had to move, but then attempted to block the government house once more and succeeded - the cabinet temporarily moved to Don Mueang International Airport.
The protesters besieged Don Mueang International Airport soon after that, giving the cabinet nowhere to work. On 1 December 2008, after protesting for 3 months, the protesters decided to leave the government house as there were constant attacks of bombs, grenades and gunfire.
