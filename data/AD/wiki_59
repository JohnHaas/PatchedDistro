Melitaea trivia

The Lesser Spotted Fritillary ("Melitaea trivia") is a butterfly of the Nymphalidae family. It is found in the southern part of the Palearctic ecozone. In Europe it is sometimes called "desert fritillary", but this name more accurately refers to the North African relative "M. deserticola".
The wingspan is 15–23 mm.
The larvae feed on "Verbascum" species.

<doc id="19285097" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19285097" title="Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire">
Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire

Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire emerged in the 1850s and became an officially endorsed preferred architectural style for church construction during the reign of Alexander II of Russia (1855–1881), replacing the Russo-Byzantine style of Konstantin Thon. Although Alexander III changed state preferences in favor of late Russian Revival, neo-Byzantine architecture flourished during his reign (1881–1894) and continued to be used until the outbreak of World War I. Émigré architects who settled in the Balkans and in Harbin after the revolution of 1917 worked on Neo-Byzantine designs there until World War II.
Initially, Byzantine architecture concentrated in Saint Petersburg and the Crimea, with two isolated projects launched in Kiev and Tbilisi. In the 1880s Byzantine designs became the preferred choice for Orthodox expansion on the frontiers of the Empire – Congress Poland, Lithuania, Bessarabia, Central Asia, northern Caucasus, the Lower Volga and the Cossack Hosts; in the 1890s, they spread from the Urals region into Siberia along the emerging Trans-Siberian Railway. State-sponsored Byzantine churches were also built in Jerusalem, Harbin, Sofia and on the French Riviera. Non-religious construction in Byzantine style was uncommon; most extant examples were built as hospitals and almshouses during the reign of Nicholas II.
History.
Background.
The last decade of Alexander I's rule was marked by state enforcement of the Empire style as the "only" architectural style for religious, public and private construction. This monopoly of a single style was lifted in the early 1830s; as Nicholas I promoted Konstantin Thon's eclectic church designs, architects (Mikhail Bykovsky) and art circles in general (Nikolai Gogol) called for general liberalization of building permit procedures, insisting on the architect's freedom to choose a style best fitting the building's functions and the client's preferences. As a result, by the end of the 1840s Russian civil architecture diversified into various revival styles (Gothic Revival by Bykovsky, Neo-Renaissance by Thon) while new church projects leaned towards Thon's "Album of model designs" or neoclassicism.
The reign of Nicholas I was marked by persistent expansion of Russia – either in the form of colonization of territories acquired earlier in the West and South (partitions of Poland–Lithuania, Novorossiya, the Crimea, the Caucasus) or in the form of increasing intervention in the Eastern Question. Nicholas shared his predecessors' aspirations for the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, and engaged in a dispute with France for control over Holy Land shrines which provoked the Crimean War. The eastern policies of the state aroused public interest and sponsored academic studies in Byzantine history and culture. The expansion of Russian Orthodoxy into the new territories created new large-scale construction projects that needed to be integrated into local environments.
The Imperial Academy of Arts, closely supervised by Nicholas, supported studies of the Orient and specifically Byzantium, but Nicholas himself despised Byzantine architecture. Ivan Strom, one of the architects of the cathedral of Saint Vladimir in Kiev, recalled Nicholas saying "I cannot stand this style, yet, unlike others, I allow it" (). Royal approval was made possible by the academic studies of the architecture of Kievan Rus in the 1830s–1840s that, for the first time, attempted to reconstruct the initial shape of Kievan cathedrals and established them as the missing link between Byzantium and the architecture of Veliky Novgorod.
The cathedral of Saint Vladimir became the first neo-Byzantine project approved by the Emperor (1852). The Crimean War, lack of funds (the cathedral was financed through private donations) and severe engineering errors delayed its completion until the 1880s. The first neo-Byzantine projects to be completed appeared after the death of Nicholas: the interiors of the Saint Sergius of Radonezh church in the Strelna Monastery, designed by Alexey Gornostaev (1859), and a small chapel of Mariinsky Palace designed by Grigory Gagarin (1860).
Royal endorsement.
Prince Grigory Gagarin, who had served in Constantinople and the Caucasus as a diplomat, became the most influential supporter of the Byzantine style – through his published studies of vernacular Caucasian and Greek heritage as well as through his service to empress Maria Alexandrovna and grand duchess Maria Nikolayevna (Alexander II's sister and president of the Imperial Academy of Arts). As early as 1856, empress Maria Alexandrovna expressed her will to see new churches executed in Byzantine style.
The first of these churches was built in 1861–1866 on the Greek Square of Saint Petersburg. Architect Roman Kuzmin (1811–1867) loosely followed the canon of the Hagia Sophia – a flattened main dome blended into a cylindrical arcade resting on a cubical main structure. Kuzmin, however, added a novel feature – instead of two apses, typical of the Byzantine prototypes, he used four. This cross-shaped layout was refined in 1865 by David Grimm, who extended Kuzmin's flattened structure vertically. Although Grimm's design remained on paper for over 30 years, its basic composition became nearly universal in Russian construction practice.
Another trend was launched by David Grimm's design of the Saint Vladimir church in Chersonesos (1858–1879). The church, built on the ruins of an ancient Greek cathedral, was sponsored by Alexander II. Grimm, also a historian of Caucasian heritage, was picked by Maria Alexandrovna, most likely upon advice by Gagarin and Maria Nikolaevna. His cross-shaped structure used a complex succession of staggered simple shapes. Grimm restricted the use of curvilinear surfaces to the main dome only; apses and their roofing were polygonal – in line with Georgian and Armenian prototypes. This "linear" variety of Byzantine architecture remained uncommon in 19th century but surged in popularity in the reign of Nicholas II.
Despite the support of the royal family, the reign of Alexander II did not produced many examples of the style: the economy, crippled by the Crimean War and further stressed by Alexander's reforms, was too weak to support mass construction. Once started, projects were delayed for decades. For example, Aleksei Avdeyev's draft of the Sevastopol Cathedral was approved in 1862, but actual work started only in 1873. The foundations, built before the war, were already in place yet construction dragged on slowly until 1888, literally consuming the architect's life. David Grimm's Tbilisi cathedral, designed in 1865, was started in 1871 and soon abandoned; construction resumed in 1889 and was completed in 1897. Grimm died one year later.
Proliferation.
Church construction and economy in general rebounded in the reign of Alexander III (1881–1894). In thirteen and a half years, the properties of the Russian Orthodox church increased by more than 5,000 places of worship; by 1894 there were 47,419 temples including 695 major cathedrals. Most of the new temples, however, belonged to the late 19th century variant of Russian Revival that became the official style of Alexander III. The turn in state preferences was signalled in 1881–1882 by two architectural contests for the design of the Church of the Savior on Blood in Saint Petersburg. Both contests were dominated by Neo-Byzantine designs, yet Alexander dismissed them all and eventually awarded the project to Alfred Parland, setting the stylistic preference of the next decade. Highly publicized features of "Savior on the Blood" – a central tented roof, excessive ornaments in red brickwork and a clear reference to Moscow and Yaroslavl relics of the 17th century – were instantly copied in smaller church buildings.
Nearly all of the 5,000 churches attributed to Alexander III were financed through public donations. 100% state financing was reserved for a few palace churches directly catering to the royal family. The "military" churches built in military and naval bases were co-financed by the state, the officers, and through popular subscription among civilians. For example, the Byzantine church of the 13th infantry regiment in Manglisi (Georgia), designed to accommodate 900 worshipers, cost 32,360 roubles, of which only 10,000 were provided by the state treasury.
Preference for Russian Revival did not mean aversion to Byzantine architecture. Alexander displayed a clear aversion to 18th century baroque and neoclassicism that he despised as symbols of Petrine absolutism; Byzantine architecture was an acceptable "middle road". Byzantine-style architects of the previous reign formed a numerous school with loyal clients, including senior clergy. Paradoxically, the Byzantine school was concentrated in the Institute of Civil Engineers which also provided a department chair to Nikolay Sultanov, informal leader of Russian Revival and an advisor to Alexander III. Sultanov's graduate, Vasily Kosyakov, made himself famous by the Byzantine churches in Saint Petersburg (1888–1898) and Astrakhan (designed in 1888, built in 1895–1904), but was just as successful in Russian Revival projects (Libava Naval Cathedral, 1900–1903). Two schools coexisted in a normal working atmosphere, at least in Saint Petersburg.
Neo-Byzantine architecture of Alexander III's reign dominated in three geographical niches. It was the style of choice for Orthodox clergy and the military governors in Congress Poland and Lithuania (cathedrals in Kaunas, Kielce, Łódź, Vilnius); in the southern regions (Kharkov, Novocherkassk, Rostov-na-Donu, Samara, Saratov and numerous settlements of Cossack Hosts); and in the Urals (Perm to Orenburg); in 1891 the list expanded with Siberian towns along the emerging Trans-Siberian Railway.
Western and southern provinces engaged in large Byzantine projects designed by alumni of the Institute of Civil Engineers. Provincial architecture was frequently dominated by a single local architect (Alexander Bernardazzi in Moldova, Alexander Yaschenko in southern Russia, Alexander Turchevich in Perm), which explains regional "clusters" of apparently similar churches. Architects usually followed the standard established by Kuzmin and Grimm, or the classical five-dome layout, with some notable exceptions. Kharkov Cathedral (1888–1901) was designed for 4,000 worshipers and equalled in height Ivan the Great Belltower in the Kremlin. The Cathedral of the Kovno fortress (1891–1895, 2,000 worshipers), contrary to Byzantine canon, was adorned by Corinthian columns, giving rise to the "Roman–Byzantine" style.
Alexander's indifference to Byzantine architecture actually increased its appeal to private clients: the style was not reserved for the Church anymore. Elements of Byzantine art (rows of arches, two-tone striped masonry) were a common decoration of brick style factories and apartment buildings. They easily blended with Romanesque or Moorish revival traditions, as in the Tbilisi Opera, designed by Victor Schroeter. Byzantine-Russian eclecticism became the preferred choice for municipal and private almshouses in Moscow. The trend was started by Alexander Ober's church of the Rukavishnikov almshouse (1879) and culminated in the extant Boyev almshouse in Sokolniki (Alexander Ober, 1890s). Moscow clergy, on the contrary, did not commission a single Byzantine church between 1876 (church of Kazan Icon at Kaluga Gates) and 1898 (Epiphany cathedral in Dorogomilovo).
Reign of Nicholas II.
The personal tastes of the last emperor were mosaic: he promoted 17th-century Russian art in interior design and costume, yet displayed aversion to Russian Revival architecture. Nicholas or his Ministry of the Court did not demonstrate a lasting preference for any style; his last private commission, the "Lower dacha" in Peterhof, was a Byzantine design following a string of neoclassical revival buildings. State-funded construction was largely decentralised and managed by individual statesmen with their own agendas. For a short period preceding the disastrous Russo-Japanese War, Byzantine style apparently became the choice of state, at least of the Imperial Navy which sponsored high-profile construction projects at metropolitan and overseas bases.
The architecture of the last twenty years of the Russian Empire was marked by a rapid succession of Art Nouveau and neoclassical revival. These styles dominated the private construction market but failed to get a firm niche in official Orthodox Church projects. However, Art Nouveau ideas slowly infiltrated traditional Byzantine architecture. Its influence was obvious in the furnishings of traditional Byzantine churches (Naval Cathedral in Kronstadt). Members of Art Nouveau (Fyodor Schechtel, Sergey Solovyov) and neoclassical (Vladimir Adamovich) schools created their own versions of the Byzantine style – either highly decorative (Schechtel's church in Ivanovo) or, on the contrary, "streamlined" (Solovyov's church in Kuntsevo). Eventually, the "northern" variety of Art Nouveau (Ilya Bondarenko) became "the" style of the legalized Old Believers.
Fragmentation of style in small-scale projects developed in parallel to four very large, conservatively styled Neo-Byzantine cathedrals: the Naval Cathedral in Kronstadt, cathedrals in Tsaritsyn, Poti (present-day Georgia) and Sofia (Bulgaria). Three of them (Kronstadt, Poti, Sofia) were a clear homage to the Hagia Sofia; their authors apparently dismissed the "golden rule" of single-dome designs established in the previous decades. Exact reasons for this change in style are unknown; in case of the Kronstadt cathedral it can be traced to direct intervention by Admiral Makarov.
Poti cathedral, designed by Alexander Zelenko and Robert Marfeld, was unusual in being the first major church project built in reinforced concrete. It was structurally completed in a single construction season (1906–1907); the whole project took less than two years (November 1905 – July 1907), an absolute record for the period. Kronstadt cathedral, also employing concrete, was structurally complete in four construction seasons (1903–1907) due to delays caused by the revolution of 1905. Other projects did not fare as well; Dorogomilovo cathedral in Moscow (1898–1910), designed to be the city's second largest, was plagued by money shortages and in the end consecrated in an incomplete, stripped-down form.
Emigration.
The Russian branch of Byzantine architecture was terminated by the revolution of 1917 but found an unexpected afterlife in Yugoslavia through theo personal support of King Alexander Karadjordjevic. Alexander sponsored Byzantine church projects by emigre architects in Belgrade, Lazarevac, Požega and other towns. Serbia and Montenegro became a new home to over a thousand construction workers and professionals from Russia. Russian immigration to Yugoslavia, estimated at 40–70 thousands, was welcomed by the government as a quick replacement of professionals killed in World War I. Vasily Androsov alone is credited with 50 Byzantine churches built in the interwar period. Russian painters created the interiors of the Monastery of Presentation and the historical Ružica Church.
The Russian diaspora in Harbin produced two interwar Byzantine cathedrals. The larger Cathedral of Annunciation, designed and built by Boris Tustanovsky in 1930–1941, was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. It was notable as one of the few large Russian Orthodox basilicas. A smaller, still extant Church of Protection, a single-dome structure designed in 1905 by Yury Zhdanov, was built in a single season in 1922. It has been Harbin's sole Orthodox place of worship since 1984.
Style defined.
Details.
Byzantine revival architecture, unlike contemporary revival styles, was easily identifiable by a rigid set of decorative tools. Some examples of the style deviated into Caucasian, neoclassical and Romanesque, yet all followed the basic dome and arcade design rule of medieval Constantinople:
Church plans and proportions.
According to 1870s studies by Nikodim Kondakov, the architecture of the Byzantine Empire employed three distinct church layouts:
Large Neo-Byzantine cathedrals erected in Russia followed either the single-dome or the five-dome plan. The single-dome plan was standardized by David Grimm and Vasily Kosyakov, and used throughout the Empire with minimal changes. Five-dome architecture displayed greater variety as architects experimented with proportions and placement of the side domes:
Smaller churches almost always followed the single-dome plan. In a few cases (as in the Saint George church in Ardon, 1885–1901) very small side domes were mechanically added to a basic single-dome floorplan. Basilica churches emerged in the last decade of the Empire; all examples were small parish churches like the Kutuzov Hut Chapel in Moscow.
Belltower problem.
The Neoclassical canon dictated that the belltower should be substantially taller than the main dome. A lean, tall belltower ideally balanced the relatively flat main structure. As early as the 1830s, Konstantin Thon and his followers ran into the "belltower problem": the compact vertical shapes of Thon's Russo-Byzantine cathedrals did not blend well with traditional belltowers. Thon's solution was to remove the belltower altogether, installing bells on a small detached belfry (Cathedral of Christ the Saviour), or integrating the belfry into the main structure (Yelets cathedral). The same problem persisted in Neo-Byzantine designs, at least in the conventional tall structures inspired by Grimm's Tbilisi cathedral. Grimm himself placed the bells in a fully detached, relatively low tower situated far behind the cathedral. However, the clergy clearly preferred integrated belltowers; detached belfries remained uncommon.
Ernest Gibere, author of the Samara cathedral (1867–1894), on the contrary, installed a massive tall belltower right above the main portal. Gibere deliberately placed the belltower unusually close to the main dome, so that at most viewing angles they blended in a single vertical shape. This layout was favored by the clergy but bitterly criticized by contemporary architects like Antony Tomishko (architect of Kresty Prison and its Byzantine church of Alexander Nevsky). It was reproduced in Tashkent (1867–1887), Łódź (1881–1884), Valaam Monastery (1887–1896), Kharkov (1888–1901), Saratov (1899) and other towns and monasteries. Most of the Byzantine buildings, however, followed the middle road: the belltower was also set above the portal, but it was relatively low (on par with side domes or apses or even lower), and spaced aside from the main dome (Riga cathedral, (1876–1884), Novocherkassk cathedral (1891–1904) and others).
Legacy.
Destruction.
Byzantine architecture, like Russian Revival, had the least chance to survive the anti-religious campaign of 1920s. Destruction peaked in 1930, targeting large downtown cathedrals with no apparent logic: Kharkov cathedral of Saint Nicholas was demolished "to streamline tram lines", while the larger cathedral of Annunciation remained standing. Most of remaining churches were closed, converted to warehouses, cinemas or offices, and left to rot without proper maintenance. Nevertheless, majority of Byzantine churches survived past the fall of the Soviet Union. The table below, including all major Byzantine cathedrals and large parish churches, summarized current (2008) state of destruction and preservation:
Revival of 1990s–2000s.
Byzantine style remains uncommon in contemporary Russian architecture. There have been projects attempting to imitate the outline and composition of typical Neo-Byzantine cathedrals in reinforced concrete, omitting the elaborate brickwork of historical prototypes (e.g. Church of Presentation of Jesus in Saint Petersburg).
Restoration of historical churches so far has a mixed record of success. There is at least one example of a Byzantine design ("City" church of Kazan Icon in Irkutsk) "restored" to imitate Russian Revival by adding tented roofs. While major cathedrals have been restored, churches in depopulated rural settlements or in the military bases (i.e. church of Our Lady the Merciful in Saint Petersburg and the Naval Cathedral in Kronstadt) remain in dilapidated conditions.

St. Killian's GAC

Saint Killian's Gaelic Athletic Club (), Whitecross is a Gaelic Athletic Association club in Armagh, Northern Ireland.
History.
The club was formed in 1904 when local parish rivals, Ballymoyer Emmetts and Tullywinney Sarsfields, came together to form a team at Whitecross which is the centre of the parish of Loughgilly, in south Armagh. They had not long to wait for their first success on the field when in January, 1906 they travelled to Abbey Park, Armagh, to take on the local Armagh Young Irelands (now known as Armagh Harps) - in the final of the county football championship. The newly formed St Killian's emerged victorious by a goal on a scoreline of 2-4 to 1-4. This was to be their only success in the senior championship.
They had to wait until 1935 for their next championship success when they annexed the Junior title by defeating near neighbours, Clady, in the final. Six years later in 1941 they defeated the famed Clan na Gael from Lurgan to win the Junior title for a second time. Their opponents included within their ranks two Ulster and county stars in Eddie McLoughlin and a future President of the Association, Alf Murray. 
Whitecross had to wait until 1969 for their next victory in the Junior Championship when they defeated Ballymacnab by two points 0-4 to 0-2 in the final at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh. Nine years later they won the Intermediate Championship defeating Cullaville Blues after a replay which took place at Carrickcruppen. 
Another highlight of 1978 and indeed in the history of the club was the official opening of St Killian's' very own football pitch - Pairc Naomh Cillian - which was opened by Con Short, the then President of the Ulster Council of the GAA. Armagh played Down in the opening match and afterwards both teams, guests and friends were entertained in the Ardmore Hotel, Newry. 
The Club had its new hall and changing room complex opened by GAA President Jack Boothman, on 4 November 1995, and a club history was launched at the Annual Dinner in their new premises during February 1996. 
Whitecross were beaten in the 1995 Junior Football Championship Final by Ballyhegan in what became known as one of the best finals at any grade in Armagh football for several decades. They reached the final again in 1996. 
The St Killian's Senior team won promotion from the 2nd Division in 2005 and successfully fought off relegation in 2006. In 2007 the team was relegated back to Division 2, but won the Intermediate Championship.
Under Age.
In recent years St Killian's has fielded successful underage teams from U8, U10, U12, U14, U16 and Minor level. The U16 and Minor teams had been amalgamated with St Joseph's (Lissummon/O'Hanlons), but in 2008 St Killian's fielded its first ever U16 team which reached the Division 3 final.
The St Brigid's minor team won its leagues in 2006 and 2007.
St Killian's Ladies.
St Killian's have fielded ladies teams from Under 14 to Minors, and from 2008 a Senior Ladies team.

Larmer Tree Gardens

The Larmer Tree Gardens near Tollard Royal in south Wiltshire, England, were created by Lieutenant-General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers in 1880 as pleasure grounds for "public enlightenment and entertainment". They were the first private gardens opened for public enjoyment in the United Kingdom, and were free to enter. The gardens are situated on the Rushmore Estate in Cranborne Chase, an ancient royal hunting ground and now an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The gardens themselves are listed as Grade II* on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England by English Heritage.
Description.
In 1880, Augustus Lane Fox inherited the Rushmore Estate, with a condition of the will stipulating that he should change his name to Pitt Rivers. He started making the Larmer Tree Pleasure Grounds almost immediately. The gardens are named after the Larmer Tree, a landmark tree on the ancient boundary between Wiltshire and Dorset. The tree was possibly an ancient Wych elm ("Ulmus glabra") under which King John (1167–1216) and his entourage were reputed to have met when they were out hunting. The original tree was still living as late as 1894, around which time it was replaced by an oak, which was planted in the centre of the decayed rim. As part of the estate, Pitt Rivers had also inherited King John's House in Tollard Royal, one of King John's several hunting lodges in Cranborne Chase.
Pitt Rivers built several structures around the main lawn which were intended to educate and enlighten the garden visitors, including the Nepalese or Indian Room which was acquired after the closure of the British Empire Exhibition in 1898. There was also a racecourse, an eighteen link golf course, a bowling green and lawn tennis courts. There were eight picnic areas, each enclosed by cherry laurel ("Prunus laurocerasus") hedges and with thatched buildings in case of inclement weather. Pitt Rivers provided "crockery, knives and forks for picnickers, gratis", as well as "chairs, tables and dumb waiters" and accommodation for 20 horses.
Music and entertainment was also provided at the Singing Theatre, where plays were performed by workers from the estate, and poetry recitals given. A band was provided on Sunday afternoons during summer. Thousands of Vauxhall lights, hanging glass lamps lit by candles, illuminated the gardens in the evening, when there was open-air dancing. The night that Thomas Hardy danced with Pitt River's daughter Agnes in 1895 he described the gardens as "Quite the prettiest sight I ever saw in my life".
By 1899 the gardens were attracting over 44,000 people a year, both estate workers and the general public. With Pitt Rivers' death in 1900 the gardens closed, opening only occasionally after that time.
Restoration of the gardens started in 1991 under the direction of Michael Pitt-Rivers. In the 90-odd years that the gardens had been closed, the cherry laurel had taken over almost all the gardens apart from the main lawn. Many of the buildings had decayed. The gardens were re-opened to the public in 1995. In 1999 a new Larmer Tree was planted to mark the new millennium.
Thomas Hardy and the Larmer Tree Gardens.
In early September 1895 Thomas Hardy and his wife Emma were staying with the Pitt Rivers at Rushmore. An annual sports day was held at the Larmer Tree Gardens on 4 September 1895, followed by a night-time dance. Hardy led off the country dancing with Agnes Grove, Pitt Rivers' youngest daughter and the wife of Walter (later Sir Walter) Grove. Agnes later became a literary pupil of Hardy's, and after her death in 1926 Hardy wrote the poem "Concerning Agnes", reflecting on the night they first met. The first two stanzas read:
The gardens today.
The gardens cover . Many of the Victorian buildings, including the Nepalese Room, a Roman Temple and the Colonial style pavilion which was originally the Tea Room, still remain. The open air theatre has a backdrop painted by the scenery department at the Welsh National Opera is based on "The Funeral of Phocion", a 1648 painting by Nicolas Poussin which is in the National Museum Cardiff. Wide cherry laurel-hedged rides radiate out from the main lawn, leading to woodland beyond. There are displays of camellias, rhododendrons, hydrangeas and eucryphias among the other trees and shrubs. Peacocks and free-flying macaws, neither indigenous to the United Kingdom, roam the gardens.
The woods contain one of the largest discrete areas of semi-natural broad-leaved woodland in southern England, which were managed and exploited for the hazel underwood trades for many centuries, involving coppicing to produce strong, straight hazel wands. A major restoration programme has taken place in the woods over the last ten years, and they are now recognised as a wildlife site of national importance.
The gardens are privately owned and are open on a fee-paying basis from Easter to the end of September each year. True to the spirit of Pitt Rivers, picknickers are encouraged at the gardens, croquet equipment and deckchairs are provided for no charge, and free music is played on Sunday afternoons. The gardens are grant-aided by English Heritage.
Film director Ken Russell first visited the gardens as a child and has used the gardens in a number of his projects over the years, including "The Debussy Film" (1965) and "The Music Lovers" (1970).
Festivals, events and concerts.
A music and arts festival, the "Larmer Tree Festival", has been held at the Larmer Tree Gardens every year from 1991 to the present. The dates for the 2009 Festival are set for 15–19 July. In 2011 the "End of the Road Festival" was held at the Larmer Tree Gardens for the sixth time. "The Enchanted Garden", a music festival that was part of The Big Chill, was held at the Larmer Tree Gardens for five years, from 1998–2002.
Other events and concerts take place at the gardens throughout the summer. In 1999 "Dining with Alice", based on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and produced by Artichoke, the company that went on to produce "The Sultan's Elephant" and "La Princesse", was performed at the gardens as part of the Salisbury International Arts Festival.
The 2009 Cranborne Chase Woodfair, organised by officers of the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is scheduled to take place at the Larmer Tree Gardens on 10–11 October 2009.

Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin

Inez van Lamsweerde (born 25 September 1963, Amsterdam, Netherlands) & Vinoodh Matadin (born 29 September 1961, Amsterdam, Netherlands) are a Dutch fashion photographer duo, well known for their work for fashion magazines, advertising campaigns, and for their independent art work.
Lives and career.
For over 25 years, Inez van Lamsweerde (1963– ) and Vinoodh Matadin (1961– ) have worked in the field of fashion photography. Working together since 1986, the award-winning Dutch partnership has built a peerless archive of work that is consistently setting new standards. Inez and Vinoodh are extremely rare in managing a successful art career in parallel to these phenomenal commercial activities. They have staged many solo exhibitions and collaborative projects at the world’s foremost galleries, participated in scores of international group shows and their artworks are held in numerous private and museum collections. 
Inez and Vinoodh live in New York with their son, Charles Star Matadin.
Meeting.
Inez and Vinoodh met at the vogue academy of fashion design in their hometown, Amsterdam, where they both initially studied fashion design — Vinoodh from 1981 to 1985 and Inez from 1983 to 1985. She proceeded to take a Masters in photography at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie (1985–90), while Vinoodh founded the Lawina clothing line with his academy classmate Rick Bovendeert. A commission for Inez to photograph the 1986 Lawina collection led to Vinoodh beginning to work with her, first as a stylist and eventually in 1995 as co-author of the images they produce together. The Lawina label closed in 1990 when Inez graduated and the pair began practicing formally as artists. 
A yearlong residency awarded to Inez by PS1 Contemporary Art Center in New York from 1992 to 1993 marked the beginning of a period of intense experimentation with the latest digital technology for the pair. This culminated in their first important bodies of work; fantastical sequences that simultaneously critiqued and celebrated the culture of commercial image making through computer manipulation. Using Paintbox software to smooth out and remove the nipples and orifices of nudes, "Thank You Thighmaster (1993)" captured the imagination of art critics with its sophisticated interplay of elegance and horror. "Final Fantasy (1993)" likewise challenged taboos about child sexuality through digitally grafting the mouths of men onto the faces of toddler children.
Burgeoning notoriety.
As Inez and Vinoodh’s notoriety burgeoned in the art world, the fashion community became equally captivated by their early editorial assignments for the style magazine BLVD in Amsterdam, where the two were now living. A breakthrough story republished as "For Your Pleasure" in British style magazine The Face in April 1994 added high-octane glamour to the dark and unsettling tenor of their work and marked them engaging with fashion explicitly as the subject of their work. Collaborating with Belgian designer Véronique Leroy, they formulated a visual vocabulary of slick, predatory figures, shiny surfaces and erotic poses that they set against hyper real backdrops constructed from stock, picture library imagery. The resulting tableaux flew in the face of the prevailing taste for documentary-centered style photography, pre-empting the end of the so-called “grunge” aesthetic and earning Inez and Vinoodh all-important editorial commissions for elite fashion magazines Visionaire and Vogue together with their first advertising contracts for luxury brands Hervé Léger and Vivienne Westwood.
Return to New York.
Inez and Vinoodh returned to New York permanently in 1995 to meet ever-increasing demands for them as assignment photographers and they have been prodigious in their output ever since. Working with a team of loyal collaborators comprising the most progressive stylists, art directors, hair and make-up artists, lighting specialists, models and recurring celebrity sitters, their extensive list of editorial contributions includes luxury fashion titles Vogue, Paris Vogue, Vogue Italia, W, Visionaire, Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar, L’Uomo Vogue, Vogue Hommes International, Vogue Nippon and Vogue China as well as style magazines Purple Fashion, Interview, V, V Man, Self Service, Another, Pop, i-D, Fantastic Man and The Gentlewoman. While Inez and Vinoodh’s imagery runs the stylistic gamut from high glamour to classical portraiture and conceptual tableaux, at its heart is a unique and highly recognizable lexicon of playful pose and extreme gesture. Devised largely in collaboration with the choreographer Stephen Galloway, it is this language that consistently transports their photographs from mere sartorial studies into something transcendent and strange.
Highly sought after as society photographers, Inez and Vinoodh have captured definitive portrait sittings with many of the key figures of film and celebrity. They have photographed four of The New York Times Magazine’s renowned “Great Performers In Film!” portfolios, in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2010, featuring definitive sittings with Clint Eastwood, Mickey Rourke, Bill Murray, Daniel Day-Lewis, Natalie Portman, Colin Firth, Shirley MacLaine, George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Mila Kunis, Michael Douglas, Tom Cruise, Javier Bardem, Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore. In 2007 Inez and Vinoodh were guest photographers of the legendary Pirelli calendar. Citing a cast of actresses young and old as their erotic heroines, their black and white close-ups of Sofia Loren, Penélope Cruz, Naomi Watts, Hilary Swank and Lou Doillon, shot in a private bedroom setting, proved to be one of the most intimate and sexually powerful of the calendar’s history.
Perhaps the greatest measure of Inez and Vinoodh’s commercial success and influence are the many advertising campaigns they have photographed for the most prestigious fashion houses such as Yves Saint Laurent, Balmain, Nina Ricci, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Isabel Marant, Giuseppe Zanotti, Lanvin Homme, Miu Miu, Christian Dior Joaillarie, Gucci, Chloé, Givenchy, Calvin Klein, Balenciaga, Yohji Yamamoto, Chanel, Roberto Cavalli, Donna Karan, DKNY, Stella McCartney, Brioni, Moschino, Loewe, Mulberry, Emanuel Ungaro, Louis Vuitton and Helmut Lang. They have also created memorable advertising imagery for fragrance and cosmetics brands Chloé Fragrance, Thierry Mugler Fragrance, Viktor & Rolf Parfum, Chanel Makeup, Lancôme, Narciso Rodriguez, Shiseido, Juicy Couture Fragrance, Gucci Sport Fragrance and Estée Lauder.
Motion image has been part of Inez and Vinoodh’s productivity for over a decade; initially in music video — CD covers for Björk led to their watershed video for her single Hidden Place (2001), created with art directors M/M (Paris) — and increasingly in the burgeoning genre of fashion film. Inez and Vinoodh collaborated with Stefano Pilati and Stephanie Cohen on Your Skin Against My Skin as part of the presentation of the Yves Saint Laurent Homme autumn/winter ’09–’10 collection. Their Girls On Film short, rendered using cutting edge Red camera technology, was commissioned to launch Paris Vogue’s iPad application in autumn 2010.
Inez and Vinoodh directed Lady Gaga's universally acclaimed 2013 music video for "Applause."
Digital retouching.
Since their breakthrough digital work of the early 1990s, Inez and Vinoodh have maintained a prolific art career, staging solo shows every two or three years. "The Forest (1995)", an unsettling series in which the features of men were grafted onto women’s bodies, posing questions about gender, toured to four international venues, while "The Widow’s" 1997 tour concluded at the prominent Matthew Marks Gallery in New York and signified the beginning of the photographers’ relationship with the gallery. A solo show of portraits of Inez and projections of herself onto those closest to her, "ME (1999)", was produced in the same year that an additional body of work on identity and loss was initiated. The "Me Kissing Vinoodh" series (1999–2010) has come to be one of Inez and Vinoodh’s most recognized projects and demonstrates how elements of their artwork find their way into commercial projects and back again. The first image from the sequence, "Me Kissing Vinoodh (Lovingly) (1999)", depicts the pair locked in an embrace, contrasting with its partner piece, "Me Kissing Vinoodh (Passionately) (1999)", which shows Vinoodh digitally erased from the composition, leaving Inez’s profile etched away in the areas where the two previous overlapped. This latter image was used as the emblem poster image for the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Bitstreams exhibition in 2001, and in 2005 the national mail service in the Netherlands made it into a limited edition European postage stamp. An additional version of the series showed a naked Inez covered in red paint, as if flayed, in contrast with the clothed Vinoodh. Originally featuring in the spring/summer 2010 advertising campaign Inez and Vinoodh created for Lanvin Homme, the image was screen printed in collaboration with the renowned printer Eugene Licht and titled "Me Kissing Vinoodh (Eternally) (2010)" to act as the final part of the trilogy.
Ambitious exhibitions.
2003 marked the launch of the first in a trilogy of ambitious solo exhibitions Inez and Vinoodh staged at Matthew Marks in New York, "The Now People", which became more radical and experimental in format as they progressed. The first, "Part I: Paradise (2003)", consisted of three large-scale black and white portraits that alluded to a contemporary Garden of Eden, while the 13 works that made up "Part II: Life on Earth (2005)" investigated political spiritualism. This show saw Inez and Vinoodh carrying motifs from their commercial imagery into their artwork, both in a vast frieze of images created in collaboration with M/M (Paris) and in the inclusion of several photosculptures drawn from their ongoing collaboration with Inez’s uncle, the esteemed sculptor Eugene van Lamsweerde. This repurposing of existing photographic imagery — whether through graphic innovations such as the 26 letters cut from model portraits to make up the silkscreen poster series created with M/M (Paris), "The Alphabet (2001)", or by electing to exhibit their imagery in pop cultural forms such as stickers or T-shirts — has become a recurrent strategy in the exhibition presentation of Inez and Vinoodh’s work over the past decade. The third installment of The Now People, "Part III: The Women (2008)", at the Andreas Grimm Gallery, Munich, focused on female archetypes. This show featured an installation entitled "The Séance"; a collection of silk-screened photographs pierced by metal as if to make thoughts, energies and emotions physical and tangible.
Retrospectives.
Recently, the many strands of Inez and Vinoodh’s career have been drawn together in a series of major retrospective outcomes that celebrate their 25 years’ outstanding work. In 2010, Pretty Much Everything: Photographs 1985–2010, a grand exhibition of 300 works, was staged at FOAM Fotografiemuseum in Amsterdam. The show began its international tour in summer 2011 at the Bienal Pavilion in São Paulo, Brazil. Autumn 2011 marks the launch of Inez and Vinoodh’s much-anticipated monograph, "Pretty Much Everything". Designed in collaboration with M/M (Paris), it is published by Taschen in 2 volumes, each containing 333 imaasdasdge pages and a pocket book size reader featuring essays and fiction by Michael Bracewell, Antony Hegarty, Penny Martin, Glenn O'Brien, Bruce Sterling and Olivier Zham, and with lyrics by Björk and Lady Gaga. The limited edition book represents the definitive survey of Inez and Vinoodh’s vast body of work and illustrates their continuing influence on the spheres of art and consumer culture.

Eguzon Dam

The Eguzon dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Creuse River in central France. Construction took place from 1922 to 1926 and, at the time, was the largest dam in Europe. 
The dam is 61 metres high and 300 metres across, with the thickness varying from 54 metres at the base to 5 metres at the top. The water behind the dam creates the Eguzon Lake (also known as the Chambon Lake) which, at 312 hectares, is the largest body of water in the region, and is popular with watersports enthusiasts. 
Electricity generation is via six valves, with a power of 12 MW each, giving an annual electricity production of 101 million kWh.

Secretary of State of Kentucky

The Secretary of State of Kentucky is one of the constitutional officers of the U.S. state of Kentucky. It is now an elected office, but was an appointed office prior to 1891. The current Secretary of State is Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. Grimes was elected to her first term on November 8, 2011. She took office on January 2, 2012.
History and name of position.
Despite the fact that Kentucky designates itself a Commonwealth, the office itself is still referred to as "Secretary of State". The office was created by Article II, Section 17 of the Kentucky Constitution of 1792 simply as "the secretary". Article III, Section 21, of the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 changed the title of the office to Secretary of State.
Section 91 of the Kentucky Constitution of 1891 (the most recent state constitution), changed the method by which the Secretary of State is selected. Prior to 1891, the secretary was appointed by the governor; under the present Constitution, the Secretary of State is elected by the qualified voters of the state. The most recent election was in 2011. In 1992, the Constitution was amended to allow the Secretary of State to serve two successive terms.
Emma Guy Cromwell ran for the office of Secretary of State, defeating another woman, Mary Elliott Flanery, and two men in the 1923 Democratic primary. In the general election, Cromwell went on to defeat her Republican opponent, Eleanor Wickliffe. She was sworn in on January 10, 1924 and became the first woman elected to statewide office in Kentucky.
Structure and duties of the office.

<doc id="19285343" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19285343" title="Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003">
Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003

The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, (Republic Acts of the Philippines) R.A. No. 9208, is a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 2444 and House Bill No. 4432. It was enacted and passed by Congress of the Philippines' Senate of the Philippines and House of Representatives of the Philippines (12th Congress of the Philippines, 2001–2004) assembled on May 12, 2003 and signed into law (List of Philippine laws) by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on May 26, 2003. It institutes policies to eliminate and punish human trafficking, especially women and children, establishing the necessary institutional mechanisms for the protection and support of trafficked persons. It aims "to promote human dignity, protect the people from any threat of violence and exploitation, and mitigate pressures for involuntary migration and servitude of persons, not only to support trafficked persons but more importantly, to ensure their recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration into the mainstream of society." 
R.A. 9208 made the Philippines one of the few Asian countries in Asia that have enacted an anti-trafficking legislation. The law establishes an Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT), first chaired by Raul M. Gonzalez, and composed of government agencies, non-government organizations and other civic organizations for the effective formulation of a comprehensive and integrated program to prevent and suppress the trafficking in persons. The Development Action for Women Network (DAWN), PMRW member organization, and the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women and the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women-Asia Pacific (CATW-AP) supported the successful passage of this law. This penal law was implemented by the issued "RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING REPUBLIC ACT NO 9208 - Anti-Trafficking Act," pursuant to the authority of IACAT under Sec. 29 of R.A. 9208.
Background.
The elimination of slavery throughout the world was campaigned by early abolitionists, but it was not the objective of the earliest organised British movements. The Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which established the "Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade" in Britain in 1787, campaigned for an end to the Transatlantic slave trade from Western Africa to the New World, which Britain dominated. Much later, the Anti-Slavery Society became the everyday name of 2 different British organizations.
The first was the 1823 "Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions" (Slavery Abolition Act 1833), and the second, the 1839 "The British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society" - which is presently known as Anti-Slavery International.[http://www.antislavery.org/]
In America, the United States federal government severely punishes human trafficking both within its borders and beyond, making it, a federal crime under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1584 makes it a crime to force a person to work against his will, whether the compulsion is effected by use of force, threat of force, threat of legal coercion or by "a climate of fear" (an environment wherein individuals believe they may be harmed by leaving or refusing to work); Section 1581 similarly makes it illegal to force a person to work through "debt servitude." Human trafficking as it relates to involuntary servitude and slavery is prohibited by the 13th Amendment. Federal laws on human trafficking are enforced by the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Criminal Section.[http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title18/title18.html]
Human trafficking or trafficking in persons is a modern and new type of global slavery which deprives people of their rights and freedom. Southeast Asia is a source, transit and destination for men, women, and children trafficked internally and internationally for the purposes of sexual exploitation and
forced labor.
The Vatican "Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People "People on the Move" (N° 96 Suppl., December 2004) reported that: "Poverty, unemployment, underemployment, landless poor and armed conflict combine to deny many children and their families in rural areas in the Philippines a secure future. These areas include the Samar-Leyte region, Negros, Bicol, Cebu Province, and Mindanao, where unscrupulous recruitment agencies operate by using a combination of deception, false promises and cash incentives to win over the parents or the children directly. Groups are "subverting" the Internet to traffic women and children, and ease of travel has enabled pedophiles to move from one country to another. Mostly foreigners are the big investors in the Philippine sex industry. Child pornography brought in by tourists teach local children about the sex acts that can be done to the tourists. The children are used to sell souvenirs and trinkets along the beaches to the tourists, who then invite them to show them child porn videos and give them money to repeat the acts on them.
Related Laws.
Human trafficking and the prostitution of children are significant legal and moral issues in the Philippines, due to control and power of organized crime syndicates. Enforcement of penal laws is, however, reported to be inconsistent.
R.A. 9208 is only one of the laws which give protection to workers, children, and women, inter alia. The Philippines has a long history of legislation aimed at protecting the rights and welfare of children. The 1974 Labor Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No. 442) set the minimum age of employment at 15 years and prohibited the employment of persons below 18 years of age in hazardous undertakings. Presidential Decree No. 603 (The Child and Youth Welfare Code) permits the employment of children aged 16 years and below only if they perform light work, which is not harmful to their safety, health or normal development, and which is not prejudicial to their studies. Strict rules and regulations were issued on their rates of pay, hours of work and other conditions of employment. An employment permit also has to be secured from the Department of Labor and Employment. The 1992 child protection law, Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) provides protection of children against abuse, commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, and employment in illicit activities. Republic Act No. 7658 (amending RA 7610) set minimum age of employment to 15 years, and 18 years and above for hazardous work. Republic Act 7160 (The Local Government Code of 1991) includes provisions for the proper development and welfare of children at the basic political level, the Barangay. It enjoins local officials to promote and support activities for the protection and total development of children, particularly those below seven years of age, and adopt measures to prevent and eradicate drug abuse, child abuse, and juvenile delinquency. Republic Act No. 9231 (19 December 2003 - An Act Providing for the Elimination of the WFCL and Affording Stronger Protection for the Working Child) - amends R.A. No. 7610 by embodying the State policy to provide special protection to children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and discrimination, and conditions prejudicial to their development, including child labour and its worst forms. It also provides stiffer penalties for their commission. It spells out the WFCL, consistent with Convention No. 182; the hours of work of working children; and ownership, usage and administration of the working child’s income. Further, it ensures working children’s access to education and training, and immediate legal, medical and psychosocial services.
In September 1995, then President Fidel V. Ramos signed Executive Order No. 275 creating a special oversight committee for the special protection of children from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, discrimination and other conditions prejudicial to their development.
Statistics.
A 1997 ILO report placed the number of child victims of prostitution at 75,000 in the Philippines, with other estimates (ECPAT) reporting as many as 100,000. Recently, around 300,000 prostitutes were found in a range of entertainment establishments, such as karaoke bars, dirt poor cabarets, beach resorts, and health clubs. Child prostitution is one the rise, estimated by ECPAT.org to be about 100,000. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported about 60,000 to 100,000 children in the Philippines involved in prostitution. There was a high incidence of child prostitution in tourist areas, where undetermined number of children are forced into exploitative labor operations. According to a report by the Consortium Against Trafficking of Children and Women for Sexual Exploitation (Catch-Wise), the Philippines is the 4th country with the most number of prostituted children, and authorities identified increases in pedophiles travelling to the Philippines.< 
The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women - Asia Pacific (CATW-AP) [http://www.catw-ap.org/aboutus.htm], quoting from Kyodo News, estimated that in 1998 there were 400,000 prostituted women in the Philippines. The International Labor Organization estimated that in 1993/94 there were nearly half a million prostitutes in the country.
The Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) recorded 959 Philippine human trafficking cases from 1992 to March 2001. The United Nations reported 9 million people enslaved in the global sex trade by powerful syndicates in human trafficking in 1999 (Coalition Against Trafficking in Women – Asia Pacific, CATW-AP). The Philippines was the first Southeast Asian country to legislate this tough statute against trafficking.
Prosecution.
R.A. 9208, specifically criminalizes trafficking for the purposes of exploitation. The punished overt acts include trafficking under the guise of arranged marriage, adoption, sex tourism, prostitution, pornography, or the recruitment of children into armed conflict. Trafficking of children is made a “qualified” offense, and higher penalties of life imprisonment and a fine of 2 million to 5 million pesos (USD 36,085 to 90,212) are imposed. Use of services of trafficked persons is penalized by 15 years imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 to 1 million pesos. Additional penalties are provided for government employees offenders. Sec 10 (c) provides for the maximum penalty for qualified trafficking under Section 6: life imprisonment and a fine of not less than 2 million pesos (P2,000,000.00) but not more than 5 million pesos (P5,000,000.00).
As complementary legislation, slavery and forced labor are also punished under Articles 272 and 274, Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, and Republic Act No. 7610, the "Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act." This law protects children under 18 years from all forms of abuse, cruelty, and exploitation and prohibits child prostitution and child trafficking.
The US report scored there was only 1 conviction under the 2003 anti-trafficking law during the reporting period, but the government made some improvement in arresting, prosecuting, and convicting traffickers. Penalties imposed for trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation are commensurate with those for rape. A Zamboanga City RTC sentenced a member of a trafficking syndicate to life imprisonment in March 2007 for having recruited 6 victims and peddled them to a brothel in Sandakan, Malaysia. The case was the 5th conviction under R.A. 9208 which resulted in a jail sentence. In 2006, the public prosecutors filed 60 new trafficking cases with the Department of Justice (Philippines), and more than 107 pending prosecutions of trafficking crime. The government appointed 17 DOJ anti-trafficking prosecutors, and 72 additional Fiscals in its regional offices. 
In Northern Mindanao, however, the report of the Sub-Committee on Human Trafficking (SCHT) submitted to the Executive Committee of the Regional Law Enforcement Coordinating Council (RLECC), Region 10 states that lack of access to legal information, aid or protection tops the list of issues and problems in the implementation of Republic Act No. 9208.
Results.
Trafficking in Persons Report: PHILIPPINES (Tier 2).
On June 3, 2005, the United States Department of State- Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons released its 2005 Trafficking in Persons Report which put the Philippines in Tier 2 Watch List Category. Countries included under the said category are those whose governments do not fully comply with the standards of the US Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards. The US report, said that: 
IACAT-DOJ Raul M. Gonzalez statement.
On 6 June 2005 Department of Justice (Philippines) Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez issued the government's official statement on R.A. 9208 vis-a-vis the U.S. State Department Report. Gonzales reported that:
2008 IACAT report.
As of June 30, 2008, the IACAT Chairman reported that it secured the conviction of Ms. Nelia Ogalesco, bringing the total number of convictions to 11, under Republic Act 9208:
Confidentiality of proceedings.
Republic Act No. 9208 (the Anti-Trafficking Law) provides for confidentiality of proceedings at any stage of the investigation, like similar enacted legislation, to wit: RA No. 9344 (the Juvenile Justice Law) mandates that all records and proceedings involving children in conflict with the law from initial contact until final disposition of the case shall be considered privileged and confidential. RA No. 9262 (the Anti-Violence Against Women Law) provides that all records pertaining to cases of violence against women and their children shall be confidential... and the right to privacy of the victim shall be respected. RA No. 8369 (the Family Court Act) provides for the confidentiality of all records of cases and the identity of the parties involved therein unless necessary and with court authority. Thus, the identity of a child victim of abuse, child witness, CIAC or a CICL shall not be disclosed whether directly or indirectly. No information that would lead to the identity of the child or any member of his family shall be published or broadcast. Photographs, images, or video coverages of the face or any distinguishing feature of a child victim of abuse, child witness, CIAC or a child in conflict with the law including his or her family members shall not be taken, published, or shown to the public in any manner. The use of sexualized images of children is considered a violation of the child’s rights. The disclosure of any private or graphic detail of the case, including the medico-legal findings, in public, is strictly prohibited. It is absolutely prohibited to access, use or in any manner disseminate a child’s case files or records. 
Ricardo R. Blancaflor, acting chairman of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT), called for the amendment of the anti-trafficking law due to the increasing number of “sexually trafficked" Filipino women workers, most especially in Singapore. GABRIELA Representative Liza Maza reported that 400,000 migrants were being trafficked internally and another 800,000 externally. Blancaflor, however, cited 11 convictions and 3 more cases submitted for decision under the law. But Blancaflor noted the confidentiality clause, Section 7, R.A. 9208 for possible amendment, it, being a bar for full disclosure of facts.
Protection.
The Philippine government relied heavily on NGOs and international organizations to provide services to victims. Victims were encouraged to file civil cases against traffickers, and the former are not penalized for any crimes committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The implementing rules and regulations of the 2003 anti-trafficking law outline identification and referral procedures. The government assisted victims by providing temporary residency status, relief from deportation, shelter, and access to legal, medical, and psychological services.
The Department of Social Welfare and Development established 42 temporary shelters for victims and 13 of these were supported by a non-profit charity organization. The government sent 8 social workers to Philippine diplomatic missions to provide psychosocial counseling to overseas Filipino workers in distress. The Philippine Ports Authority provided the building and facilities for halfway houses in Manila, Davao, Batangas, and Sorsogon, managed by an NGO; the Ports Authority, police, and the Coast Guard referred victims to the halfway houses. In March 2007, the Department of Labor and Employment opened the first reintegration center where returning overseas Filipino workers may seek services such as skills training, psycho-social counseling, and business development assistance.
This law saves and protects many women and children from and against prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage, both domestic and overseas. R. A. Sec. 4b of 9208 supplements the Anti Mail-order bride law which only prohibits matching of Filipino women for marriage to foreign nationals on a mail-order bride formula, for this law punishes "introducing or matching any Filipino woman to a foreign national for marriage for the purpose of acquiring, buying, offering, selling, or trading her to engage in prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage is also considered an act of trafficking."
RA 9208 directs the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) to establish programs for Filipinos who are trafficked overseas, to ensure the safety of overseas Filipinos. This law covers both national and international migration, and requires the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Immigration (BI), Philippine National Police, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), NCRFW, and local government units (LGUs), to establish programs to prevent, protect, and rehabilitate trafficked victims.
Legal gaps, hiatus and amendment of the law.
Department of Social Welfare and Development Secretary Esperanza Cabral, Co-Chair of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking Forum stated on October 19, 2008, that "while Republic Act No. 9208 prohibits the recruitment or abduction of people for the purpose of selling their organs, an IRR specifically dealing with organ trafficking would 'address the apparent gaps in the law and existing policies' on the ‘donation’ of organs by a living non-related donor. The 1991 World Health Organization Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation will limit the terms of the proposed Implementing Rules and Regulations."
Prevention.
In 2007, the government's Interagency Council Against Trafficking established its first Ninoy Aquino International Airport anti-trafficking task force. In 2006 the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) increased the minimum monthly wage from $ 200 to $ 400 and raised the minimum age from 18 to 23, and it required prospective domestic workers to get a certificate of competency from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and the Overseas Workers' Welfare Administration. In 2006, POEA conducted 1,000 pre-employment orientation seminars for more than 60,000 departing overseas Filipino workers. The Task Force Against Illegal Recruitment was created to develop strategies against illegal recruitment activities. 
On September, 2008, an intensified campaign against human trafficking ("massive exploitation of safe migration") was launched by the Visayan Forum Foundation, Inc. (VFFI), a non-governmental organization with the support of the United States Ambassador to the Republic of the Philippines, United States embassy. Kristie A. Kenney said at the launch: "Human trafficking is a global problem. It is modern-day slavery and victims rarely have a voice." The VFFI provide halfway houses for trafficking victims, and the Philippine Ports Authority built halfway houses in ports for rescued victims. But DOJ Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking said that the campaign against human trafficking had no budget.
Senate inquiry.
On September 15, 2004, the first hearing was held on escort services. followed by a second hearing on September 22, 2004, attended by well-known movie personalities [http://www.senate.gov.ph/13th_congress/spot_reports/LABOR.%20-SEPT.%2022%20HEARING.pdf and a third hearing, attended by representatives from KTVs. [http://www.senate.gov.ph/13th_congress/spot_reports/HEARING%20REPORT%20-%203%20ESCORT%20SERVICE.pdf]
Philippines Senator Ramon Bong Revilla, Jr., on July 26, 2006, called for coordination with the Philippine National Police vis-a-vis the public, the whistle blowers and anti-prostitution Internet online petitioner initiators, to shed light and solve the alleged prostitution in the Philippines, sexual slavery or trafficking in human beings dens in Angeles City, Pampanga. Revilla re-filed Senate Bill No. 12, the "Anti Pornography Bill."
However, Angeles City police Chief Sonny Cunanan denied the allegations, alleging "the Women's and Children's Concerned Section (WCCS) and other agencies of the Angeles City Government that are responsible for the regular inspection of different bars and nightclubs have no records about the existence of a sex slave camp in the city." But he confirmed that "Angeles intelligence policemen, in coordination with other counterparts, were directed to look into the veracity of the report and file necessary charges against the operators of the illegal activities if these really exist."
Batingaw Network.
On September 15, 2007, the Children and Youth Secretariat of the Anti-Child Pornography Alliance (ACPA-Pilipinas) launched Batingaw Network to protect and save children from all abuses and exploitations. It is the biggest coalition against child pornography (cyber-sex dens; Internet shops "with pornographic cubicles"). It declared September 28 as the ""National Day of Awareness and Unity against Child Pornography"."

Buddhism in North Karnataka

Buddhism in North Karnataka
Introduction.
Discovery of an Ashoka inscription at Maski in Raichur District a few decades ago and of a Buddhist settlement through a series of archeological excavations at Sannati have shed light on the historic significance of Karnataka in the development of Buddhism. 
During 1954-95, 81 stone inscriptions, 2 stupas, 3 dibbas or mounds and a defence fort have been discovered at Sannati.
History.
Buddhism had in fact entered Karnataka before the time of the Emperor Ashoka, 
and that it enjoyed its heyday between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D.
Mauryas.
Buddhism first emerged during Mauryas times when there was a missionary zeal. 
Parts of Karnataka were subject to the rule of the Mauryas. Chandragupta Maurya’s son Bindusara (298-273 BC) and Bindusara’s son Ashoka (269-232 BC) caused some of his edicts to be put up here. Ashoka’s grandson Samprati Chandragupta is believed to have come to Shravanabelagola where he spent his last years. 
Eleven Ashokas edicts :
4 in Bellary District, 
3 in Raichur District and 
3 others in Chitradurga District 
bear witness to the Mauryas presence in Karnataka.
Shatavahana.
The Shatavahana may have been a Karnataka dynasty, as Dharwad and Bellary Districts are called Shantavahani Hara (or Shantavahana region). Some of their kings were called rulers of Kunthala, the old name for Karnataka.
The Shatavahana were successors to the Mauryas and ruled in Banavasi, as is evident from the Nasik inscription of Gautamiputra Satakarni and the copper plates from Hirehadagali.
At Sannati in Gulbarga District, as well as Vadgoan Madhavpur near Belgaum and Brahmagiri in Chitradurga District, there are remains of monuments of their period. The Uttara Kannada area of Banavasi has their inscription at Vasan in Dharwad District, and there are remains of a brick temple.
Kadamba.
Kadambas capital was also Banavasi, known as Vaijayanti. They were tolerant towards Buddhism as epigraphic evidence shows. Recent excavations of the site of Banavasi have given the remains of a Buddhist stupa. The large apsidal structure is what remains and it was planned like a dharma chakra. Kadambas century was a prominent one for Buddhism in Karnataka. 
Chinese traveller, Hieun Tsang, visited Banavasi in the 7th century AD and saw 1000 sangharamas and three stupas. He Said By the side of the royal palace was a great sangharama with 300 priests, all men of distinction. This convent has a great vihara 100 in height.
It became difficult for Buddhism to survive, lost its specific identity and got 
merged with Shaivism. The Buddhist legacy in Karnataka survives in the teachings of Basaveshwara (Basavanna) in 12th century.
Buddhist temple in North Karnataka.
Aihole, is today an insignificant village in Bagalkot District of North Karnataka. This place was a workshop for temple architects and sculptors patronized by early Chalukyas monarchs. Here are some of the earliest structural temples in stone in the country, dating from 450 AD, including one of the 4 Buddhist shrines in Karnataka. Aihole’s hillock, Meguti, to the rock cut Buddhist shrine. It is the most important surviving Buddhist temple in Karnataka.

Don't Suppose

"Don't Suppose" is the solo debut album by the English singer Limahl (formerly and currently lead singer with the British band Kajagoogoo), released in 1984 by EMI Records on vinyl LP and cassette only.
The album was not released on compact disc until 2012 on the Gold Legion label, though several songs from the album have appeared on other albums. The compilation album "The Best of Limahl" features eight tracks from "Don't Suppose", and the compilation "Neverending Story—Best of Limahl" features seven tracks. The song "Tar Beach", which appears on neither of those albums, is featured on two joint compilations with Kajagoogoo. "The Greenhouse Effect" has never been officially released on compact disc. (Later editions of "Don't Suppose" replaced "The Greenhouse Effect" with "The Never Ending Story".)
The album.
The album was released twice, in two slightly different editions. The second edition omitted "The Greenhouse Effect", which came at the end of side one; it was replaced with the hit single "The Never Ending Story", from the soundtrack to the film "The NeverEnding Story". The new track was composed by American producer Giorgio Moroder; Moroder also authored the instrumental B-side on the single release of "Ivory Tower", as well as most of the singer's second solo album, "Colour All My Days". Limahl came to know Moroder while performing his song "Only for Love" at a rock festival in Tokyo; Moroder suggested that Limahl sing the movie's title song.
With the exception of "The Never Ending Story", Limahl composed the lyrics and music for the album himself. The original release was produced by Dave Harris and Tim Palmer; Palmer had previously collaborated with Kajagoogoo. "The Never Ending Story" had lyrics by Keith Forsey and was produced by Moroder. In a 1984 Japanese television interview, Limahl said that "Don't Suppose" saw him experimenting much more than he did on "White Feathers", Kajagoogoo's debut album (which included "Too Shy"). Much of the record features a string section; flutes and saxophones also join Limahl's keyboards.
Limahl explained that the title, "Don't Suppose", was an invitation to the listener to personally verify the value of his music, without supposing, assuming, or guessing.
The album was moderately successful, although it was a commercial failure in the UK where it peaked at number 63 (much lower than Kajagoogoo's second album, released that same year, which peaked at number 35). In the US it did better, reaching #41.
The singles.
The song "Only for Love", the first single released from the album, peaked at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart in late 1983. The B-side of the single, "O.T.T. (Over The Top)", was never released on an album; it was a studio version of "Over the Top", an "a cappella" track partially sung by Limahl with Nick Beggs during the concert filmed for the VHS and Laserdisc release of Kajagoogoo's "White Feathers Tour". The original live version included only the first two verses; the single includes a third verse, a middle section, and a final chorus with a brief coda.
"Too Much Trouble" was the second release, though this failed to reach the UK Top 40.
The third single, "The Never Ending Story", charted in 17 countries, reaching the top 5 in several and number one in Spain, Sweden and Norway. In Italy and Germany, the song reached the number-two position. In the US the song only reached number 17 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In France and other French-speaking countries, "The Never Ending Story ("L'histoire sans fin")", a French version of the song also sung by Limahl, was released instead.
The fourth single, "Tar Beach", was released only in Germany, with "The Greenhouse Effect (Live)" as its B-side.
Tracks on compact disc.
In March 2012, Gold Region issued the album on CD in the US featuring remixes of "Never Ending Story" and "Only For Love" as bonus tracks. In 2014, Parlophone reissued it in Warner Music's budget boxed set Original Album Series along with "Colour All My Days" and the three Kajagoogoo albums without bonus material.
The first eight tracks were digitised by Dutch budget label Disky Communications for inclusion on the compilation album "The Best of Limahl", released in 1996. That album omits the last two tracks of "Don't Suppose": "Tar Beach" and "Oh Girl"; also missing is "The Greenhouse Effect", although "The Never Ending Story" is included. The compilation was re-released in 2003.
In 2002, Disky released a reduced version of the compilation, "Neverending Story—Best of Limahl", which included seven songs from "Don't Suppose".

Forward premium anomaly

The forward premium anomaly in currency markets refers to the well documented empirical finding that the domestic currency is expected to appreciate when domestic nominal interest rates exceed foreign interest rates. This is puzzling because economic theory and intuition suggests that international investors would demand higher interest rates on currencies expected to "fall" in value.

Learn to Live

Learn to Live is the second solo studio album by American country artist, Darius Rucker. The album was released September 16, 2008 on Capitol Nashville Records and was produced by Frank Rogers. "Learn to Live" was Rucker's first studio album marketed towards country music, and is also his first release since 2002 R&B release "Back to Then." The album had spawned three number one singles on the "Billboard" country music chart: "Don't Think I Don't Think About It," "It Won't Be Like This for Long," and "Alright." "Learn to Live" is Rucker's best-selling solo album to date, as it is the first, and so far, the only solo album of his to get to platinum.
Background.
"Learn to Live" was recorded both in Franklin, Tennessee, and Nashville, Tennessee. Brady Vercher of "The 9513" praised the album's overall production and sound, finding nearly every track to, "sound as if it were crafted to be a potential single, with solid hooks and melodies aplenty, but at times the phrasing is more focused on selling those aspects at the expense of emotion." "Slant Magazine"'s Johnathan Keefe praised the album's production, saying that the record makes, "a concerted effort to sound like a modern country album." He also gave credit to the album's producer, Frank Rogers (who had previously produced Brad Paisley's albums), who had co-written most of the album's twelve tracks. 
Many of the tracks are a variety of country music styles. The second track, "All I Want" is set in a two-step shuffle, while "Drinkin' and Dialin'" is a "clever barroom crawl," according to "Allmusic." "All I Want" features guitar played by Brad Paisley and its fifth track, "If I Had Wings," features harmony vocals from country artists Vince Gill and Alison Krauss.
Critical reception.
"Learn to Live" received a score of 66 out of 100 from Metacritic based on "generally favorable reviews". Blake Boldt of "PopMatters" gave the album overall solid review, praising the single, "Don't Think I Don't Think About It," by calling Rucker's delivery, "honest and heartfelt." Boldt was also pleased with the fact that Rucker attracted, "the attention of the country radio audience with that single, and it’s helped boost the profile of his first full country album, Learn to Live, a release that owns a variety of country music’s common topics and musical techniques." Boldt concluded his review by saying, "Learn to Live is well-produced and well-sung, but too many of the songs fail to fit the artist behind them." Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" also praised "Learn to Live", calling the single, "Alright," an "essential" track. Rodman later stated, "If you're going to be tooling down the middle of the road, "Learn to Live" is perfectly pleasant accompaniment."
"Learn to Live" was also reviewed by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of "Allmusic," who gave the release three out of five stars. Like "PopMatters," Erlewine was pleased that Rucker chose to make a "leap" into country music. Erlewine frequently compared the album to Hootie & the Blowfish's "Cracked Rear View," saying that the material was, "written with Rucker in mind, not a jam band, they're more pop in form and feel than anything he's done since." Erlewine then stated, "...these songs aren't knockouts, but they're friendly and comfortable, the kind of sturdy roots-pop that seems like it'd be easy to pull off but must not be, as this delicate balance of conversational melody and guy-next-door appeal has proven elusive to Rucker for over a decade now." "The New York Times" favored the album as well. Critic, Jon Caramanica found Rucker to be "well-suited" to country music and called the tracks, "impressively eclectic and sharply written." He compared "Alright" to that of the recent hits by country singer, Craig Morgan, and then concluded by saying, "Such missteps song "If I Had Wings" are few, though, and “Learn to Live” is seamless enough that it almost slips by unnoticed that Mr. Rucker is the first African-American to have a Top 10 country hit (the muscular “Don’t Think I Don’t Think About It”) since Charley Pride."
Chart performance.
The album's lead single, "Don't Think I Don't Think About It" was released May 27, 2008. The song became Rucker's first number one single by September 2008, becoming the first African-American country artist to have a major hit since Charley Pride in the 1980s. "Learn to Live" debuted at #1 on the Billboard Country Albums chart and at #5 on the overall Billboard 200, selling 60,000 copies in its first week. As of February 2010, the album has sold 1,298,274 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has now been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments to retailers of a million copies. After releasing the album's second single in late 2008 entitled, "It Won't Be Like This for Long," the song became his second number one single on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart. The album's seventh track entitled, "Alright," was released as a single shortly afterward. The song became Rucker's third number one single on the "Billboard" country chart, spending two weeks at #1 in early August. On September 8, 2009, the album's fourth single, "History in the Making," was released, debuting at #51 on the "Billboard" country chart.

Admiral (film)

Admiral () is a 2008 biopic about Alexander Kolchak, a Vice-Admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy and leader of the anti-communist White Movement during the Russian Civil War. The film also depicts the love triangle between the Admiral, his wife, and the poet Anna Timiryova.
According to director Andrei Kravchuk, "film is about a man who tries to create history, to take an active part in history, as he gets caught in the turmoil. However, he keeps on struggling, he preserves his honour and his dignity, and he continues to love."
Plot.
The film opens during the production of "War and Peace" at Mosfilm Studios in 1964. An elderly Russian noblewoman is set to appear as a film extra until her past comes to light. Although the film's political commissar demands her dismissal since she is a "wife of an enemy of the revolution", director Sergei Bondarchuk is adamant that he needs faces like hers for the production. As the commissar realises it difficult by only using the file he has, he immediately recognises the elderly woman behind him as the woman he is searching for, while the elderly woman is looking at her own 1910s photo.
The film flashes back to the Baltic Sea in 1914. Captain Alexander Kolchak (Konstantin Khabensky) is laying naval mines from his ship in German territorial waters when he runs across SMS Friedrich Carl, an armoured cruiser of the German Imperial Navy. As chaos reigns on his ship, Kolchak sights in one of the guns and succeeds in seriously damaging the bridge of the German vessel. This buys him only a brief respite, however.
Realising that the enemy ship is blocking his line of escape, Kolchak informs his men that the only way to return to safety is to lure the Germans onto one of his mines. As the ship steams into the mines they have just laid, Kolchak leads his men in Russian Orthodox prayers for God's protection. Although they barely avoid hitting their own mines, the German ship is not so lucky and sinks with almost all hands.
Later, at their naval base in the Grand Duchy of Finland, now promoted to Rear Admiral, Kolchak is introduced to Anna Timireva (Elizaveta Boyarskaya), the wife of his subordinate officer and close friend Captain Sergei Timirev. The strong attraction between them immediately becomes apparent. Although Sergei reminds his wife that they took vows before God, Anna is unmoved and wants nothing more than to be with the Admiral.
Although terrified of losing him, Sofia Kolchak (Anna Kovalchuk) offers to leave for Petrograd and let her husband be with Anna if he so desires. The Admiral, however, firmly tells her, "You are my wife and I am your husband. That is how it always shall be."
His feelings for Anna continue to grow, however. When she approaches him to deliver a love letter, Kolchak informs her that they cannot ever meet again. When Anna demands to know why, the Admiral responds, "Because I love you."
Later, he is informed that the Tsar (Nikolai Burlyayev) has promoted him to Vice Admiral in command of the Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol. After receiving a last minute letter from Kolchak, Anna rushes to the train station to see off her beloved. She is too late, however, and experiences only an uncomfortable look from Sofia.
After the February Revolution in 1917, officers are disarmed and summarily executed at the Kronstadt naval base. Sergei barely escapes the island with Anna. Meanwhile, a group of enlisted men, now with their cockades on their sailor caps changed from a Tsarist insignia to a red revolutionary cockade, arrive aboard Kolchak's flotilla in Sevastopol and demand that all officers surrender their arms. To avoid bloodshed, Kolchak orders his subordinates to obey. However, he throws his own sword into the harbour rather than hand it over, but the sailors didn't complain about it.
Later, Kolchak is summoned to Petrograd by Alexander Kerensky (Viktor Verzhbitsky), who offers to appoint him Minister of Defence. Kolchak, however, sharply criticises Kerensky for promoting indiscipline in both the Russian Army and Navy. He states that the only way he will accept is if he is given a free hand to restore old practices. Kerensky, enraged by Kolchak's "counterrevolutionary sympathies," exiles him to the United States, excusing that "the allies needs more experts".
After the October Revolution, Anna and Sergei Timiriov are travelling on the Trans-Siberian Railroad when she learns that Kolchak has returned and is leading a detachment of the anti-communist White Army at Omsk. Sergei, who has become a Red Commissar, is shocked when she returns to their carriage and announces that she is leaving him. After commenting about what a year of Revolution it has been, Sergei helps Anna to pack her things.
After hearing Kolchak's speeches about defeating the Bolsheviks and "restoring Russia," Anna is deeply moved and goes to work as a nurse among the wounded of the Russian Civil War. Meanwhile, Kolchak is informed that the Red Army is advancing on Omsk, assisted by sympathizers behind White lines. Although his advisors all suggest defending Omsk to the last, Kolchak decrees that they will instead evacuate Omsk and seize Irkutsk as the new capital of anti-communist Russia.
During the evacuation of Omsk, Anna is recognised by a White officer who informs Kolchak. Deeply moved, the Admiral goes to her and announces that, although he made the mistake of leaving her once, he will never do so again. As the train steams toward Irkutsk, Kolchak informs Anna that he has written to his wife Sofia, who now lives in Paris, and formally asked for a divorce. Although he asks Anna to marry him, she insists that there is no need of marriage and that what matters is that they are together now. Eventually, she relents and they are seen attending the Divine Liturgy together.
Meanwhile, Irkutsk is under the nominal control of the French General Maurice Janin and the Czechoslovak Legions. With their defences disintegrating, the Red Army offers them only one way out alive. As a result, General Janin agrees to hand over Admiral Kolchak.
As a massive land force of White soldiers rides and marches toward Irkutsk, Kolchak is placed under arrest by the Czechs and handed over to the Reds. Despite Kolchak's attempts to shield her, Anna insists that, as his wife, she must be arrested, too.
Kolchak is given a cursory trial by the Irkutsk soviet and executed by a firing squad along the banks of the frozen Angara River. His last words are, "Send word to my wife in Paris that I bless our son."
Kolchak's body is then dumped into a hole drilled into the ice by the local Orthodox clergy for Great Blessing of Waters on Epiphany. It is revealed that Anna survived more than 30 years in the Gulag and was only released during the Khrushchev thaw.
Meanwhile, in 1964, Anna Timiorova witnesses a rehearsal for one of the ballroom scenes from "War and Peace", as she accidentally bumps into an actor playing as a waiter, breaking a glass of wine, which reminds her of the first time she meets Kolchak, then the film shifts to her imagination as she dreams of the formal dance she was never able to share with her beloved. The fates of the film's main characters are revealed in captions.
Release.
The first screening of the film took place on October 9, 2008.
Themes.
Actress Elizaveta Boyarskaya said of her character, "She was a woman of such force, of such will, with such magnanimity... I feel an amazing resemblance to her... When I read script, I was even a bit scared: because she has the same vision of history as me. All that can arrive at is me. And when I played Anna, I did not play, I was her. It is my epoch, my attitude regarding love." After being asked about the film, Doctor Zhivago, she stated, "The only thing that these two films share consists in the love which the Russian women can carry; it is a topic approached by many novels. They love up to the last drop of blood, till the most dreadful end, to the death; they are capable of leaving family and children for the love of the man which they have chosen.
Soundtrack.
The main original song for the film is called "Anna". It is performed by Russian singer Victoria Dayneko. The music for the song was composed by Igor Matvienko and the poem itself was written by Anna Timireva in memory of Admiral.
The other song "Vopreki" ("Despite") was written by Konstantin Meladze. This song is performed by Russian star Valery Meladze.

Their track "Lullaby" was featured on the soundtrack album of "Californication" on the US Showtime network.
In Korea two tracks, "Alien" and "Perfect World", were featured on the soundtrack album of network drama series "Coffee Prince", while "Lullaby" featured in an advertisement for Sky mobile phones, and "Babies Eyes" in an advert for "17" tea. "Alien" also appeared in the soundtrack of the film "Turning Green", and in the soundtrack of "One Tree Hill" (series 1, episode 15).
In 2005 they played a tour of the US west coast, including gigs at Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.
Their most recent, and apparently final album, "Yield", was released via Pastel in Korea in 2010.

Global Action Plan

Global Action Plan is an NGO that specialises in sustainable behaviour change, and in particular in ESD. There are programs for schools and youth, households and communities, and workplaces. The ethos is that small changes to the choices we make every day make a big difference when widely adopted.
History.
In 1989 Global Action Plan was established in the United States and the Netherlands on the initiative of David Gershon and Bessie Schadee. The first results from a 'household EcoTeam program' were presented at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The program was conceived to involve everyday people in creating solutions to environmental problems.
Structure.
The Global Action Plan idea and methods spread to a number of countries. Global Action Plan is now an international network with national and regional member organizations around the world. The member organizations are autonomous.
Methods and tools.
Ever since its inception, Global Action Plan has worked in 'action research' mode to learn from experience, exploring what enables actual behaviour change. Numerous research reports attest to the effectiveness of the methods and programs.
Global Action Plan UK.
Global Action Plan was launched in its current form in the UK by Director, Trewin Restorick. The first UK programme engaged 30,000 households and was supported by thousands of volunteers, who participated and received action packs that offered practical tips on ways to use energy efficiently, reduce waste, cut water use in their homes and to shop ethically.
Since then new programmes have come online working with businesses and schools. More organizations have now jointed the Global Action Plan network worldwide to take up the challenge, with several countries adopting the UK programmes due to their proven high levels of success.
Environment Champions: trains staff in corporations to run internal campaigns to change behaviour to reduce environmental impacts, for which they won an Ashden Award in 2008.
EcoTeams: trains groups of householders to monitor their resource use and reduce over time
Action at School: works with teachers and pupils to green their schools.
Global Action Plan UK's approach.
On Global Action Plan's website they express their approach as being:
•Practical and positive - it can be hard for people to tackle overwhelming environmental issues like climate change so we break them down into small steps that everyone can take, like unplugging mobile phone chargers when they're not being used.
•Measurable - we help people to see the difference they are making by measuring the resources saved as a result of their actions and those of their community. For example, just 63 households in our Nottingham EcoTeams programme have collectively saved a massive 7 tonnes from ending up on the rubbish mountain.
•Interactive - changing habits alone is difficult. Watch a team of businessmen build a teetering tower of paper in their corporate lobby, and you'll see what's different about Global Action Plan. By supporting groups of people working together, we make taking action easier, more creative and much more fun.
•Inclusive - everyone gets switched on by different things. Working with all kinds of individuals and organisations has enabled us to come up with a range of imaginative ways to communicate. Try riding our Energy Bike for a totally different way of making the connection between energy use and climate change.

Auxiliary particle filter

The auxiliary particle filter is a particle filtering algorithm introduced by Pitt and Shephard in 1999 to improve some deficiencies of the sequential importance resampling (SIR) algorithm when dealing with tailed observation densities.
Assume that the filtered posterior is described by the following "M" weighted samples:
Then, each step in the algorithm consists of first drawing a sample of the particle index formula_2 which will be propagated from formula_3 into the new step formula_4. These indexes are auxiliary variables only used as an intermediary step, hence the name of the algorithm. The indexes are drawn according to the likelihood of some reference point formula_5 which in some way is related to the transition model formula_6 (for example, the mean, a sample, etc.):
This is repeated for formula_8, and using these indexes we can now draw the conditional samples:
Finally, the weights are updated to account for the mismatch between the likelihood at the actual sample and the predicted point formula_10:

Modular function deployment

Modular function deployment (MFD) is a systematic method and procedure for company-supportive product modularization.
Five steps.
MFD consists of five major steps. It starts with quality function deployment (QFD) analysis to establish customer requirements and to identify important design requirements with a special emphasis on modularity. The functional requirements on the product are analysed and technical solutions are selected. This is followed by systematic generation and selection of modular concepts, in which the module indication matrix (MIM) is used to identify possible modules by examining the interrelationships between ”module drivers” and technical solutions. MIM also provides a mechanism for investigating opportunities of integrating multiple functions into single modules. The expected effects of the redesign can be estimated and an evaluation can be carried out for each modular concept. The MIM is then re-used to identify opportunities for further improvements to the single modules.

Griffon (framework)

Griffon is an open source rich client platform framework which uses the Groovy programming language (which is in turn based on the Java platform). Griffon is intended to be a high-productivity framework by rewarding use of the Model-View-Controller paradigm, providing a stand-alone development environment and hiding much of the configuration detail from the developer. A significant portion of the build environment is directly derived from the Grails codebase and hence follows many of its conventions.
The first release is the fruit of the effort by the Groovy Swing team and an attempt to take the best of rapid application development, as indicated by its Grails-like structure, the agility of Groovy, and the availability of components for Swing.
Overview.
Griffon aims to reduce the typical confusion that occurs with traditional Swing development. Due to the MVC structure of Griffon, developers never have to go searching for files or be confused on how to start a new project. Everything begins with:
The generated project follows this structure:
The builder infrastructure enables seamless integration of different widget libraries such as Swing, JIDE, and SwingX.
Griffon’s built-in scripts include targets for desktop, webstart, and applets. The baseline requirement is Java 5 or higher.
In the first release, three sample applications are included :
Plugins.
Griffon can be extended with the use of plugins. Plugins provide run-time access to testing libraries such as Easyb and FEST, and all widget libraries besides core Swing are provided as plugins. The plugin system allows for a wide range of additions, for example
Documentation.
Official manual.
The Griffon Guide is the official manual of the Griffon framework. It describes all that a developer needs to know to get started, including a reference to all properties and method additions.
Books.
Features that would eventually become integral parts of Griffon (UI builders) were featured in these books:
Books that cover Griffon:
Refcard.
Dzone published a Getting started with Griffon Refcard as part of their Refcardz program.
Screencasts.
Todd Costella produced a series of screencasts dubbed Griffoncast that show how to get started with Griffon.

Johann Deutschmann

Johann Deutschmann (August 10, 1625 – August 12, 1706) was a German Lutheran theologian.
Biography.
Deutschmann was born in Jüterbog and studied at the University of Wittenberg. In 1657 he became extraordinary professor, and in 1662 ordinary professor at University of Wittenberg. During the Syncretistic Controversy and Pietistic controversy he represented the extreme orthodox Lutheranism; and opposed especially the younger Calixtus and the theology of the Pietists. Against Spener, the leader of the Pietists, he charged no less than 263 heresies. To his scientific interests belonged the development of the so-called "Theologia paradisiaca", i.e., that Adam, the patriarchs, and the whole Old Testament agreed with the Augsburg Confession and Formulas of Concord. To prove this, he published an "Antiquissima theologia positiva primi theologi Adami", a "Symbolum apostolicum Adami"; and "Der christlutherischen Kirche Prediger-Beicht and Beichtstuhl von dem grossen Jehova-Elohim im Paradiese gestiftet".
Deutschmann was the son-in-law of the orthodox professor Abraham Calovius. He died in Wittenberg.

<doc id="19285747" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19285747" title="Vegas Vampire">
Vegas Vampire

The Vegas Vampire was a fictional character invented and portrayed by entertainer Jim Parker as the horror host of late night "Shock Theater" and "Vegas Vampire" shows at KHBV/KVVU, Channel 5, in Henderson, Nevada, and broadcast to the greater Las Vegas, Nevada area from the late 1960s through the 1970s.
The Vegas Vampire's show featured grade-“B” horror films, monster films, and science fiction films. The show was aired on Friday nights at 11 p.m. PST.
History.
Parker, a Wisconsin-native, worked in as a disc jockey and stock car racing promoter, and as a news reporter. During a stint as a reporter for an NBC affiliate in Las Vegas he decided he wanted to do a comedy show, but the station was not interested, nor were the other network affiliate stations. Finally, he sold the show to the local Channel 5 station (KHBV/KVVU). He picked the name "Vegas Vampire" because he liked the alliteration.
The show ran on and off for nine years. Parker even claims one cancellation was due to his ending up on President Richard Nixon's enemies list after the Vampire did a routine with a Nixon voodoo doll, stuck pins in it and put the doll in a guillotine in a comparison to Marie Antoinette.
Show format.
The character of the Vampire appeared at the start of each show and at commercial break interruptions. Like other horror hosts, he would critique and ridicule the film being aired. One of his early trademark routines was to stick pins in voodoo dolls of politicians, civic leaders, and celebrities while needling them verbally. The character became popular enough that nationally known celebrities would sometimes appear on the show while performing in Vegas, including Red Buttons and Frank Sinatra, Jr. The Vampire would also read viewer letters on air, then burn them.
Early on the Vampire segments were performed live, but later it was a taped program, allowing it to be played multiple times during the weekend. 
The host's then wife, Paula (P.J.) Parker (now P.J. Housman), played the part of "Satana" on the show in its later years.
In 1977, Variety and syndicated columnist Forrest Duke reported plans to do a road show version.
Other appearances.
Parker's Vegas Vampire was a popular local celebrity. He traveled the streets of Las Vegas and Henderson in a trademark Hearse, and appeared at many local business openings. For many years he hosted the local segments of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon, and participated in local shows and charity events like the St. Jude's "Nite of Stars" show, and the Clark County Talent Guild's "Stars of Tomorrow" show. So popular was the character that at one point Parker was appointed director of publicity and public relations for TV-5. One Halloween in the 1990s the Vegas Vampire was invited to return to Vegas' Circus Circus to turn the Grand Slam Canyon (later Adventuredome) ride complex into the Dome of Doom.
Novelty song.
"The Vegas Vampire" is also the title of a novelty song about the character. Written and produced by Parker and Bruce Popka, the recording has been played on the Dr. Demento radio program's 1984 Halloween Show and appeared on the album "Elvira: Vinyl Macabre Oldies (But Ghoulies) (Vol. 1)"

<doc id="19285762" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19285762" title="LTE Advanced">
LTE Advanced

LTE Advanced is a mobile communication standard. It was formally submitted as a candidate 4G system to ITU-T in late 2009. It was approved by the ITU as meeting the requirements of the IMT-Advanced standard, and was finalized by 3GPP in March 2011. It is standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a major enhancement of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard.
Background.
The LTE format was first proposed by NTT DoCoMo of Japan and has been adopted as the international standard. LTE standardization has matured to a state where changes in the specification are limited to corrections and bug fixes. The first commercial services were launched in Sweden and Norway in December 2009 followed by the United States and Japan in 2010. More LTE networks were deployed globally during 2010 as a natural evolution of several 2G and 3G systems, including Global system for mobile communications (GSM) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) (3GPP as well as 3GPP2).
The work by 3GPP to define a 4G candidate radio interface technology started in Release 9 with the study phase for LTE-Advanced. Being described as a 3.9G (beyond 3G but pre-4G), the first release of LTE did not meet the requirements for 4G (also called IMT Advanced as defined by the International Telecommunication Union) such as peak data rates up to 1 Gb/s. The ITU has invited the submission of candidate Radio Interface Technologies (RITs) following their requirements in a circular letter, 3GPP Technical Report (TR) 36.913, "Requirements for Further Advancements for E-UTRA (LTE-Advanced)." These are based on ITU's requirements for 4G and on operators’ own requirements for advanced LTE.
Major technical considerations include the following:
Likewise, 'WiMAX 2', 802.16m, has been approved by ITU as the IMT Advanced family. WiMAX 2 is designed to be backward compatible with WiMAX 1 devices. Most vendors now support conversion of 'pre-4G', pre-advanced versions and some support software upgrades of base station equipment from 3G.
The mobile communication industry and standards organizations have therefore started work on 4G access technologies, such as LTE Advanced. At a workshop in April 2008 in China, 3GPP agreed the plans for work on Long Term Evolution (LTE). A first set of specifications were approved in June 2008. Besides the peak data rate 1 Gb/s as defined by the ITU-R, it also targets faster switching between power states and improved performance at the cell edge. Detailed proposals are being studied within the working groups.
Proposals.
The target of 3GPP LTE Advanced is to reach and surpass the ITU requirements. LTE Advanced should be compatible with first release LTE equipment, and should share frequency bands with first release LTE. In the feasibility study for LTE Advanced, 3GPP determined that LTE Advanced would meet the ITU-R requirements for 4G. The results of the study are published in 3GPP Technical Report (TR) 36.912.
One of the important LTE Advanced benefits is the ability to take advantage of advanced topology networks; optimized heterogeneous networks with a mix of macrocells with low power nodes such as picocells, femtocells and new relay nodes. The next significant performance leap in wireless networks will come from making the most of topology, and brings the network closer to the user by adding many of these low power nodes — LTE Advanced further improves the capacity and coverage, and ensures user fairness. LTE Advanced also introduces multicarrier to be able to use ultra wide bandwidth, up to 100 MHz of spectrum supporting very high data rates.
In the research phase many proposals have been studied as candidates for LTE Advanced (LTE-A) technologies. The proposals could roughly be categorized into:
Within the range of system development, LTE-Advanced and WiMAX 2, can use up to 8x8 MIMO and 128 QAM in downlink direction. Example performance: 100 MHz aggregated bandwidth, LTE-Advanced provides almost 3.3 Gbit peak download rates per sector of the base station under ideal conditions. Advanced network architectures combined with distributed and collaborative smart antenna technologies provide several years road map of commercial enhancements.
A summary of a study carried out in 3GPP can be found in TR36.912.
Timeframe and introduction of additional features.
Original standardization work for LTE-Advanced was done as part of 3GPP Release 10, which was frozen in April 2011. Trials were based on pre-release equipment. Major vendors support software upgrades to later versions and ongoing improvements.
In order to improve the quality of service for users in hotspots and on cell edges, heterogenous networks (HetNet) are formed of a mixture of macro-, pico- and femto base stations serving corresponding-size areas. Frozen in December 2012, 3GPP Release 11 concentrates on better support of HetNet. Coordinated Multi-Point operation (CoMP) is a key feature of Release 11 in order to support such network structures. Whereas users located at a cell edge in homogenous networks suffer from decreasing signal strength compounded by neighbor cell interference, CoMP is designed to enable use of a neighboring cell to also transmit the same signal as the serving cell, enhancing quality of service on the perimeter of a serving cell. In-device Co-existence (IDC) is another topic addressed in Release 11. IDC features are designed to ameliorate disturbances within the user equipment caused between LTE/LTE-A and the various other radio subsystems such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and the GPS receiver. Further enhancements for MIMO such as 4x4 configuration for the uplink were standardized.
The higher number of cells in HetNet results in user equipment changing the serving cell more frequently when in motion.
The ongoing work on LTE-Advanced in Release 12, amongst other areas, concentrates on addressing issues that come about when users move through HetNet, such as frequent hand-overs between cells.

Halina Jaworski

Halina Jaworski (born December 13, 1952) is a German artist and abstract painter.
She has lived and worked in Düsseldorf, Germany since 1973.
Biography.
Halina Jaworski was born 1952 in Gdańsk and was raised in Sopot. Due to a wave of anti-semitism during March 1968 events in Poland she and her family immigrated to Israel. She studied at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, where the staff included professors from the Bauhaus school. At Bezalel she created her first white paintings and performed linguistic experiments, in which linguistic structures formed the pictorial structures, shown at International Symposium of Concrete poetry in Selb (1977). These experiments were continued at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts in Prof. Günther Uecker's class. She received her master student degree ("Meisterschülerin") in 1979 and remained at the Academy until 1980 as an assistant lecturer. 
Beginning in 1977 she experimented with polaroid photography, which resulted in the installations entitled "Poesie und Gemeinheit der kleinen Dinge" (Poetry and Meanness of Small Objects). Starting in 1978 she experimented with painted polygonal "shaped canvases" and the dialogue of their forms on the wall. Since 1982 she has created various cycles of "shaped canvas", including "Schilde" ("Shields"), "Spielzeug" ("Toys"), "Die Büchse der Pandora" ("Pandora's Box"), and "Unterwegs" ("On the Way"). In 1979 she placed a number of -high flagpoles with -wide banners on the Wupper river bank ("Fahnen Skulptur" / "Flag Sculpture"). The flags had circular openings with a diameter. In 1980 she created her first pyramids made of triangular paintings on canvas, called "Die Berge" ("The Mountains"), a series shown in 1981 at the Düsseldorf Museum of Art at the "Treibhaus" exhibition and in 1985 at the "Process und Konstruktion" exhibition in Munich, forming the installation "Gipfeltreffen" ("Summit"). 
In 1982 she was the originator of an auction of works of art and an exhibition to protest "against the martial law in Poland" ("Gegen das Kriegsrecht in Polen"), both held at the Kunstmuseum Düsseldorf. In 1990 the painting entitled "Polnischer Adler mit Häftlings Mütze" (Polish Eagle with Prisoner's Cap) was given to Anda Rottenberg as a gift for the first museum of art in independent Poland. In 1984 she started working on the cycle "Ahnen" ("Ancestors"), shown among others at the "Dialog" exhibition in Warsaw (Centrum Sztuki, 1989) and Düsseldorf (Kunstmuseum, 1990). 
Around this time she created the first series of watercolors on paper, called "Ansichtskarten" ("Postcards"), shown among others in 1991 at the Richard Demarco Gallery in Edinburgh. This series of paper works has grown into "Ansichtskarten und Ansichtssachen" ("Postcards and Views"), an extensive set of hundreds of collage works (watercolors and photos), which were shown in different one-man shows at the Kunsthalle Altdorf (2001), Kunstverein Oerlinghausen (2002) and at the Representation of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia to the European Union in Brussels (2004).

Johan Randulf Bull Hambro (24 October 1915 – 27 February 1993) was a Norwegian journalist, translator and biographer. He was the fourth son of Norwegian politician C. J. Hambro, whose biography he wrote in 1984. He lived in the United States from 1939 to 1982, where he studied and worked as a foreign-affairs journalist, press attaché and consulate-general. He was secretary general of the Norse Federation for 27 years, from 1955 to 1982. He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1975.
Family.
Hambro was born on 24 October 1915 in Kristiania, the fourth son of politician C. J. Hambro (1885–1964) and his wife, Gudrun "Dudu" Grieg (1881–1943). He was a paternal grandson of Nico and Edvard Isak Hambro, and a brother of Carl Joachim and Edvard Hambro. His namesake was his second great-grandfather, Johan Randulf Bull (1749–1829), Norway's first Supreme Court Justice. Hambro married Lore Aickelin in 1945.
Career.
He grew up in the Uranienborg neighbourhood in the West End of Oslo, and enrolled at the Royal Frederick University in 1933. Following law studies, he graduated in 1939 with a cand.jur. degree, and travelled to the United States to study at Columbia University in New York. From 1940 to 1945, during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was employed at the Norwegian general consulate in New York City. He worked as a foreign affairs journalist for the conservative newspaper "Aftenposten" from 1946 to 1948 and for the Norwegian News Agency from 1949 to 1953. He was a press attaché for the Norwegian United Nations delegation in 1953 and 1954. After that, he was stationed in New York as a foreign correspondent and radio chronicler for Norway.
In 1955, he succeeded Arne Kildal as secretary general of the non-profit Norse Federation, and became editor of its periodical, "The Norseman". In 1957, Hambro was the chief editor of the Norse Federation's 50th anniversary book, "De tok et Norge med seg" ("They brought a Norway with them"). He edited its Christmas booklet, "Norges Jul" ("Norway's Christmas"), in 1975. Hambro was succeeded by Johan Fr. Heyerdahl as secretary general of the Norse Federation in 1982. Two years later, the federation started a summer course for Norwegian students, which it named after Hambro.
Hambro released a biography on his father, C. J. Hambro, in 1984, titled "C. J. Hambro: Liv og drøm" ("C. J. Hambro: Life and Dream"). The book was well received by critics, and sold more than 30,000 copies in 1984. The book is known for revealing many secrets about his father's private life, including his relationship with the actress Gyda Christensen. Like his father, Hambro translated many books from English to Norwegian, among them "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand in 1949, "First Among Equals" by Jeffrey Archer in 1985, and "A Sport of Nature" by Nadine Gordimer in 1988.
Death and recognition.
In 1958, Hambro was pronounced an honorary citizen of Minneapolis. He was given the Regents Award of St. Olaf College in 1972. Honorary degrees were bestowed by Luther College in 1969 and St. Olaf College in 1979. Hambro was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1975. He died on 27 February 1993 in Oslo, at age 77.

Labsome is limited to a maximum of 20 students a year, who have completed a Bachelor of Communication in any stream offered by the school. Graduates must have reached the minimum academic standard of a Distinction average (70%) or better in their third year of undergraduate study to gain entry to Labsome.
Industry and community links.
In line with RMIT University's "industry-relevant" focus, the RMIT School of Applied Communication has appointed a number of leading figures from the communication industries to the position of Adjunct Professor. In addition to its regular full-time academic staff award-winning journalist Chris Masters, former CEO of Australia's largest PR firm, Turnbull Porter Novelli, Noel Turnbull, internationally-renowned designer Garry Emery, and leading Australian film and television producer Ewan Burnett are all part-time faculty members of the school.
In 2003, the school was chosen by Australia's peak body for professional Public Relations and Communication practitioners, the Public Relations Institute of Australia (PRIA), as one of only two institutions nationally to deliver its annual series of professional development courses, lectures, seminars and events. 
The school also hosts a renowned public lectures series by leading Australian and international speakers. Previous notable speakers have included: Professor Terrell Carver, Director of the Global Media Research Center Professor John Downing, scientist and global warming activist Dr. Tim Flannery, Wall Street Journal editor Robert Thomson and Senator Judith Troeth.
The school has hosted the XIIIth Biennial Conference of the Film and History Association in 2006 and the 2007 Asian Cities Symposium.
AFI Research Collection.
The Australian Film Institute (AFI) Research Collection is a non-lending, specialist film and television industry resource. It opened in the mid-1970s as the George Lugg Library, and was a joint venture between the AFI and the Victorian Federation of Film Societies. In 2002 it became an auspice of the RMIT School of Applied Communication, in conjunction with the AFI. 
The collection has particular strengths in screen history and theory and in Australian cinema, and features a diverse range of books, journals, film scripts, film directories, reports and film festival catalogues. A notable part of the original library was a rare collection of books on pre-cinema and early cinema history as-well-as early cinema artifacts, which were all part of the valuable David Francis Collection (David Francis was the founder of the UK's National Film and Television Archive), and purchased by the Victorian and Australian governments in 1975. The early cinema artifacts of the collection are now housed at the Scienceworks Museum, however, the rare books remain in the collection at RMIT.
In 2003, the Australian Broadcasting Authority donated the Henry Mayer Collection to the RMIT School of Applied Communication. Over his many years as an academic, Henry Mayer assembled and annotated a massive collection of communications literature, which is now available through the AFI Research Collection. Also included in the AFI Research Collection is the Wayne Royal Levy Collection, the personal library of the internationally respected academic, author and documentary film maker; as-well-as a substantial number of film stills from the Australian and international film industries.
Journals and publications.
The school publishes a number of journals, most notably the "Southern Review: Communication, Politics and Culture". The Southern Review is an internationally respected, interdisciplinary journal focusing on the connections between communication and politics, and is published three times a year. It was first published in 1963 (as the Australian Journal of Literary Studies) by the English Department of the University of Adelaide, and gained its international reputation during the 1980s through the publication of innovative and influential arguments and analyses in literary and cultural theory (e.g.: early articles by Tony Bennett, Catherine Belsey, Terry Eagleton, Stephen Greenblatt, Ian Hunter, Colin MacCabe, Christopher Norris). It moved from the University of Adelaide to the Communication Department of Monash University in 1995, before finding its home in the RMIT School of Applied Communication in 2000.

RMS Titanic

RMS "Titanic" was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. The sinking of "Titanic" caused the deaths of more than 1,500 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS "Titanic" was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service. "Titanic" was the second of three "Olympic" class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, and was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast with Thomas Andrews as her naval architect. Andrews was among those lost during the sinking. On her maiden voyage, she carried 2,224 passengers and crew.
Under the command of Edward Smith, the ship's passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America. The first class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. A wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use. Though "Titanic" had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard due to outdated maritime safety regulations. "Titanic" only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number on board, and one-third her total capacity.
After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, "Titanic" called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship's time. The glancing collision caused "Titanic"s hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "women and children first" protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats. By 2:20 am, she broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after "Titanic" foundered, the Cunard liner RMS "Carpathia" arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.
The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers. Many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute; many families, particularly those of crew members from Southampton, lost their primary bread-winners. They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations. Some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board; the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, faced social ostracism for the rest of his life.
The wreck of "Titanic" remains on the seabed, split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of . Since her discovery in 1985, thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world. "Titanic" has become one of the most famous ships in history, her memory kept alive by numerous books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials.
Background.
The name "Titanic" was derived from Greek mythology and meant gigantic. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (as it then was), the RMS "Titanic" was the second of the three "Olympic"-class ocean liners—the first was the RMS "Olympic" and the third was the HMHS "Britannic". They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912. The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).
The White Star Line faced a growing challenge from its main rivals Cunard, which had just launched the and the — the fastest passenger ships then in service — and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be bigger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace their oldest pair of passenger ships still in service, being the SS "Teutonic" of 1889 and SS "Majestic" of 1890. "Teutonic" was replaced by "Olympic" while "Majestic" was replaced by "Titanic". "Majestic" would be brought back into her old spot on White Star's New York service after Titanic's loss.
The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff, who had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867. Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a general concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff was authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five percent profit margin. In the case of the "Olympic"-class ships, a cost of £3 million for the first two ships was agreed plus "extras to contract" and the usual five percent fee.
Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing the "Olympic"-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager. Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.
On 29 July 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three "letters of agreement" two days later authorising the start of construction. At this point the first ship—which was later to become "Olympic"—had no name, but was referred to simply as "Number 400", as it was Harland and Wolff's four hundredth hull. "Titanic" was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.
Dimensions and layout.
"Titanic" was long with a maximum breadth of . Her total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was . She measured 46,328 gross register tons and with a draught of , she displaced 52,310 tons.
All three of the "Olympic"-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:
Features.
Power.
"Titanic" was equipped with three main engines—two reciprocating four-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engines and one centrally placed low-pressure Parsons turbine—each driving a propeller. The two reciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000 hp and a further 16,000 hp was contributed by the turbine. The White Star Line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner, the SS "Laurentic", where it had been a great success. It provided a good combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an "Olympic"-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners "Lusitania" and "Mauretania". By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of steam.
The two reciprocating engines were each long and weighed 720 tons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons. They were powered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and 5 single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces. The boilers were in diameter and long, each weighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.
They were heated by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in "Titanic"s bunkers with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen working around the clock. 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea. The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively generously there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.
Exhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a condenser, to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused. The engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of . The middle propeller was slightly smaller at in diameter, and could be stopped but not reversed.
"Titanic"s electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time. Immediately aft of the turbine engine were four 400 kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide electrical power to the ship, plus two 30 kW auxiliary generators for emergency use. Their location in the stern of the ship meant that they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.
Technique.
The interiors of the "Olympic"-class ships were subdivided into sixteen primary compartments divided by fifteen bulkheads which extended well above the waterline. Eleven vertically closing watertight doors could seal off the compartments in the event of an emergency. The ships' exposed decking was made of pine and teak, while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated cork to combat condensation. Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted buff with black tops, though only three were functional—the last one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes—and two masts, each high, which supported derricks for working cargo. 
"Titanic"s rudder was large enough—at high and long, weighing over 100 tons—that it required steering engines to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short tiller through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction. As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam capstans. The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two kedging anchors).
The ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while "Titanic" was in port, but in an emergency the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.
"Titanic" was equipped with two 1.5 kW spark-gap wireless telegraphs located in the radio room on the Boat Deck, in the Officers' quarters. One set was used for transmitting messages and the other, located in a soundproofed booth called the "Silent Room", for receiving them. The signals were transmitted through two parallel wires strung between the ship's masts, above the funnels to avoid the corrosive smoke. The system was one of the most powerful in the world, with a range of up to . It was owned and operated by the Marconi Company rather than the White Star Line, and was intended primarily for passengers rather than ship operations. The function of the two wireless operators—both Marconi employees—was to operate a 24-hour service sending and receiving wireless telegrams for passengers. They did, however, also pass on professional ship messages such as weather reports and ice warnings.
Passenger facilities.
The passenger facilities aboard "Titanic" aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to "Titanic"'s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a manor house or an English country house.
"Titanic" was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high-class hotels—the Ritz Hotel was a reference point—with First Class cabins finished in the Empire style. A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the Renaissance to Victorian, were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would "at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore".
Passengers could use an on-board telephone system, a lending library and a large barber shop. The First Class section had a swimming pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, a Turkish bath, an electric bath and a Verandah Cafe. First Class common rooms were adorned with ornate wood panelling, expensive furniture and other decorations, while the Third Class general room had pine panelling and sturdy teak furniture. The "Café Parisien" was located on a sunlit veranda fitted with trellis decorations and offered the best French "haute cuisine" for First Class passengers.
Third Class (also commonly referred to as Steerage) accommodations aboard "Titanic" were not as luxurious as First Class, but even so were better than on many other ships of the time. They reflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for trans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities. 
The White Star Line had long since broken that mold. As seen aboard "Titanic", all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and ten passengers. 
Third Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard "Titanic" included the Forecastle Deck forward, the Poop Deck aft, both well decks and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a reading room for women, and although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.
Leisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.
One of "Titanic"s most distinctive features was her First Class staircase, known as the Grand Staircase or Grand Stairway. This descended through seven decks of the ship, from the Boat Deck to E deck in the elegant style depicted in photographs and movies, and then as a more functional and less elegant staircase from there down to F deck. It was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls lit by gold-plated light fixtures. 
At the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of "Honour and Glory Crowning Time" flanking the clock face. The Grand Staircase was destroyed in "Titanic"s sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks. During the filming of James Cameron's "Titanic" in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.
Mail and cargo.
Although "Titanic" was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a Royal Mail Ship (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the Royal Mail (and also for the United States Post Office Department). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables) of space in her holds was allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks, three Americans and two Britons, who worked thirteen hours a day, seven days a week sorting up to 60,000 items daily.
The ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs and even motor cars. Despite later myths, the cargo on "Titanic"s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, exotic minerals or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam", was valued at only £405 (£ today). "Titanic" was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the hold. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.
Lifeboats.
"Titanic" carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65 people each and four Englehardt "collapsible" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two emergency cutters with a capacity of 40 people each. "Olympic" herself did not even carry the four collapsibles A-D in the 1911–12 season. All of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats A and B, connected to davits by ropes. Those on the starboard side were odd-numbered 1–15 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered 2–16 from bow to stern.
The two cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate use, while collapsible lifeboats C and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats 1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number 1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them challenging to launch. Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.
"Titanic" had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle 4 lifeboats. This gave "Titanic" the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats which would have been enough for 4,000 people—considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178 people, only one-third of "Titanic" total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to carry 16 lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants. 
Therefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required. At the time, lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship—not keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore. Had the "SS Californian" responded to "Titanic"'s distress calls, the lifeboats would have been adequate to ferry the passengers to safety as planned.
Building and preparing the ship.
Construction, launch and fitting-out.
The sheer size of "Titanic" and her sister ships posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this large. The ships were constructed on Queen's Island, now known as the Titanic Quarter, in Belfast Harbour. Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing slipways and build two new ones, the biggest ever constructed up to that time, to accommodate the giant ships. Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by Sir William Arrol & Co., a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the Forth Bridge and London's Tower Bridge. The Arrol Gantry stood high, was wide and long, and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.
The construction of "Titanic" and "Olympic" took place virtually in parallel, with "Olympic"s hull laid down first on 16 December 1908 and "Titanic"s on 31 March 1909. Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder, with the keel acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom deep supported 300 frames, each between and apart and measuring up to about long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.
The 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of rolled steel, mostly up to wide and long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons. Their thickness varied from to . The plates were laid in a clinkered (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were laid in the "in and out" fashion, where strake plating was applied in bands (the "in strakes") with the gaps covered by the "out strakes", overlapping on the edges. Steel welding was still in its infancy so the structure had to be held together with over three million iron and steel rivets which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand.
The work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time, safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was dangerous and was carried out without any safety equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, deaths and injuries were to be expected. During "Titanic"s construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them "severe", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds. Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.
"Titanic" was launched at 12:15 pm on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpoint Morgan and J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers. 22 tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the River Lagan. In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne. The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.
Although "Titanic" was virtually identical to the class's lead ship "Olympic", a few changes were made to differentiate the two ships. The most noticeable of these was that "Titanic" (and the third vessel in class "Britannic") had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay, and was intended to provide additional shelter to first class passengers. These changes made "Titanic" marginally heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected due to design changes ordered by Ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair "Olympic", which had been in a collision in September 1911. Had "Titanic" been finished earlier, she might well have missed her collision with an iceberg.
Sea trials.
"Titanic's" sea trials began at 6 am on Monday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage. The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair. Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on "Titanic" sea trials, Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators, and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked, and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.
The sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in Belfast Lough and then in the open waters of the Irish Sea. Over the course of about twelve hours, "Titanic" was driven at different speeds, her turning ability was tested and a "crash stop" was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in or 3 minutes and 15 seconds. The ship covered a distance of about , averaging and reaching a maximum speed of just under . 
On returning to Belfast at about 7 pm, the surveyor signed an "Agreement and Account of Voyages and Crew", valid for twelve months, which declared the ship seaworthy. An hour later, "Titanic" left Belfast again—as it turned out, for the last time—to head to Southampton, a voyage of about . After a journey lasting about 28 hours she arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the port's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of her crew.
Maiden voyage.
Both "Olympic" and "Titanic" registered Liverpool as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line as well as Cunard were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the "Olympic", most British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as "Lusitania" and "Mauretania", sailed out of Liverpool followed by a port of call in Ireland. However, the "Olympic" class liners were to sail out of the port of Southampton on England's southern coast. Southampton had many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its closer proximity to London.
In addition Southampton, being on England's southern coast, allowed ships to easily cross the English Channel and make a port of call in northern France, usually at Cherbourg. This allowed British ships to pick up clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers in southern Ireland. The "Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run" would become so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after World War I. Out of respect for Liverpool, ships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. "Queen Elizabeth 2" was one of the first ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard in 1969.
"Titanic"s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many cross-Atlantic journeys between Southampton in England, Cherbourg in France, Queenstown in Ireland and New York in the United States, returning via Plymouth in England on the eastbound leg. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December 1912 still exists. The White Star Line intended to operate three ships on that route: "Titanic", "Olympic" and the smaller RMS "Oceanic".
Each would sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually leaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New York, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each direction. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey passengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively. The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the ""White Star Dock"" had been specially constructed to accommodate the new Olympic-class liners, and had opened in 1911.
Crew.
"Titanic" had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage. Like other vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton. The process of signing up recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew during "Titanic"s sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.
Captain Edward John Smith, the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from "Olympic" to take command of "Titanic". Henry Tingle Wilde also came across from "Olympic" to take the post of Chief Mate. "Titanic"s previously designated Chief Mate and First Officer, William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller, were bumped down to the ranks of First and Second Officer respectively. The original Second Officer, David Blair, was dropped altogether.
"Titanic"s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling, with 494. The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen, but were either engineers, firemen or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses. The rest represented a great variety of professions—bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners and even a printer, who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the "Atlantic Daily Bulletin" with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.
Most of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April; in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40 percent were natives of the town. A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class "A La Carte" Restaurant and the Café Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight musicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers. Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's £105 a month (equivalent to £ today) to the £3 10"s" (£ today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.
Passengers.
"Titanic"s passengers numbered around 1,317 people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class and 709 in Third Class. 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of which were in Third Class. The ship was considerably under capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,566 passengers—1,034 First Class, 510 Second Class and 1,022 Third Class.
Usually, a high prestige vessel like "Titanic" could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a national coal strike in the U.K. had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before "Titanic" sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. "Titanic" was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as "City of New York" and "Oceanic" as well as coal "Olympic" had brought back from a previous voyage to New York and which had been stored at the White Star Dock.
Some of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard "Titanic", travelling in First Class. Among them were the American millionaire John Jacob Astor IV and his wife Madeleine Force Astor, industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim, Macy's owner Isidor Straus and his wife Ida, Denver millionairess Margaret "Molly" Brown, Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, couturière Lucy (Lady Duff-Gordon), cricketer and businessman John Borland Thayer with his wife Marian together with their son Jack, the Countess of Rothes, author and socialite Helen Churchill Candee, journalist and social reformer William Thomas Stead, author Jacques Futrelle with his wife May, and silent film actress Dorothy Gibson, among others. "Titanic"s owner J. P. Morgan was scheduled to travel on the maiden voyage, but cancelled at the last minute. Also aboard the ship were the White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay and "Titanic"s designer Thomas Andrews, who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship.
The exact number of people aboard is not known as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about fifty people cancelled for various reasons, and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey. Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares from London, Southampton or Queenstown cost £7 5"s" (equivalent to £ today) while the cheapest First Class fares cost £23 (£ today). The most expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to £870 in high season (£ today).
Collecting passengers.
On Wednesday 10 April 1912 "Titanic"s maiden voyage began. Following the embarkation of the crew the passengers began arriving from 9.30 am when the London and South Western Railway's boat train from London Waterloo station reached Southampton Terminus railway station on the quayside, right alongside "Titanic"s berth. The large number of Third Class passengers meant that they were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to within an hour of departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith on boarding. Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to them being refused entry to the United States—not a prospect that the White Star Line wished to see, as it would have to carry them back across the Atlantic. 922 passengers were recorded as having embarked "Titanic" at Southampton. Further passengers were picked up at Cherbourg and Queenstown.
The maiden voyage began on time at noon. An accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later as "Titanic" passed the moored liners SS "City of New York" and "Oceanic". Her huge displacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water, then dropped into a trough. "New York"s mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards "Titanic". A nearby tugboat, "Vulcan", came to the rescue by taking "New York" under tow and Captain Smith ordered "Titanic"s engines to be put "full astern". The two ships avoided a collision by a matter of about . The incident delayed "Titanic"s departure for about an hour while the drifting "New York" was brought under control.
After making it safely through the complex tides and channels of Southampton Water and the Solent, "Titanic" headed out into the English Channel. She headed for the French port of Cherbourg, a journey of . The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast. Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of "Titanic", tenders had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, the SS "Traffic" and the SS "Nomadic". Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the Olympic-class liners and were launched shortly after "Titanic". ("Nomadic" is today the only White Star Line ship still afloat.) Four hours after "Titanic" left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. 274 more passengers boarded "Titanic" and 24 left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8 pm "Titanic" weighed anchor and left for Queenstown with the weather continuing cold and windy.
At 11.30 am on Thursday 11 April, "Titanic" arrived at Cork Harbour on the south coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day with a brisk wind. Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of her size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. 113 Third Class and seven Second Class passengers came aboard, while seven passengers left. Among the departures was Father Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee, who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard "Titanic", including the last-ever known photograph of the ship. A decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member, stoker John Coffey, a native of Queenstown who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore. "Titanic" weighed anchor for the last time at 1.30 pm and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.
Atlantic crossing.
After leaving Queenstown "Titanic" followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock, a distance of some . From there she travelled along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as "the corner" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. "Titanic" sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg. The final leg of the journey would have been to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.
The first three days of the voyage from Queenstown passed without incident. From 11 April to local apparent noon the next day, "Titanic" covered ; the following day, ; and by noon on the final day of her voyage, . From then until the time of her sinking she travelled another , averaging about . 
The weather cleared as she left Ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind. Temperatures remained fairly mild on Saturday 13 April, but the following day "Titanic" crossed a cold weather front with strong winds and waves of up to . These died down as the day progressed until, by the evening of Sunday 14 April, it became clear, calm and very cold.
"Titanic" received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Nonetheless the ship continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time. Although the ship was not trying to set a speed record (a perennial myth<), time-keeping was an overriding priority and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed, with ice warnings seen as advisories and reliance placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge. It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907 SS "Kronprinz Wilhelm", a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still been able to complete her voyage, and Captain Smith himself had declared in 1907 that he could not "imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that."
Sinking.
At 11.40 pm on 14 April (ship's time), lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of "Titanic" and alerted the bridge. First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be put in reverse, but it was too late; the starboard side of "Titanic" struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline. (The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern ultrasound surveys of the wreck suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than . Considerable emphasis has also been placed on the quality and strength of the rivets securing Titanic's hull sections together.) Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as she could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. "Titanic" began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.
Those aboard "Titanic" were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, where ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels, "Titanic" only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats. The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full. Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water. The "women and children first" protocol was generally followed for the loading of the lifeboats and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard.
At 2:20 am, two hours and forty minutes after "Titanic" struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as her forward deck dipped underwater and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates. As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship began to break in two between the third and fourth funnels due to the immense strain on the keel. With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it, before sinking. For many years it was generally believed the ship sank in one piece, however when the wreck was located many years later, it was discovered that the ship had fully broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were plunged into lethally cold water with a temperature of only . 
Life expectancy in such temperatures is often under 15 minutes even for people who are young and fit. The victims would have died from bodily reactions to freezing water rather than hypothermia (loss of core temperature). Plunged into freezing seas, around 20% of victims die within 2 minutes from cold shock (uncontrolled rapid breathing and gasping causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and panic), another 50% die within 15–30 minutes from cold incapacitation (inability to use or control limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body 'protectively' shuts down peripheral muscles to protect its core), and exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time. Almost all of those in the water died of cardiac arrest or others of these causes within 15–30 minutes. Only 13 of them were helped into the lifeboats though these had room for almost 500 more people.
Distress signals were sent by wireless, rockets and lamp, but none of the ships that responded was near enough to reach her before she sank. A nearby ship, "Californian", which was the last to have been in contact with her before the collision, saw her flares but failed to assist. Around 4 am, RMS "Carpathia" arrived on the scene in response to "Titanic"s earlier distress calls. About 710 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by "Carpathia" to New York, "Titanic"s original destination, while 1,500 people lost their lives. "Carpathia"'s captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20 large bergs measuring up to high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from "Titanic"; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.
Aftermath of sinking.
Arrival of "Carpathia" in New York.
"Carpathia" took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. Her journey was slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas. She was, however, able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. The initial reports were confused, leading the American press to report erroneously on 15 April that "Titanic" was being towed to port by the SS "Virginian".
Later that day, confirmation came through that "Titanic" had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died. The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal, Southampton, Liverpool and Belfast. It hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking. 4 out of 5 crew members came from this town.
"Carpathia" docked at 9.30 pm on 18 April at New York's Pier 54 and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain. Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organisations. Many of "Titanic"s surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia. "Titanic"s 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer SS "Lapland", where they were accommodated in passenger cabins. 
"Carpathia" was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to Fiume, Austria-Hungary. Her crew were given a bonus of a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of "Titanic"s passengers joined together to give them an additional bonus of nearly £900 (£ today), divided among the crew members.
The ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the pilot boat "New York", which guided "Carpathia" into harbour, and one even managed to get onto "Carpathia" before she docked. Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards. It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard "Titanic".
Insurance and aid for survivors.
In January 1912, the hulls and equipment of "Titanic" and "Olympic" were insured through Lloyd's of London. The total coverage was £1,000,000 (£ today) per ship. The policy was to be 'free from all average' under £150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now Willis Group), was 15 s (75 p) per £100, or £7,500 (£ today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days.
Many charities were set up to help the victims and their families, many of whom lost their sole breadwinner, or, in the case of many Third Class survivors, everything they owned. On 29 April opera stars Enrico Caruso and Mary Garden and members of the Metropolitan Opera raised $12,000 in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of "Autumn" and "Nearer My God To Thee" were part of the program. In Britain, relief funds were organised for the families of "Titanic"s lost crew members, raising nearly £450,000 (£ today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the 1960s.
Investigations into the disaster.
Even before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and Great Britain, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of the failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-oriented. 
The US Senate's inquiry into the disaster was initiated on 19 April, a day after "Carpathia" arrived in New York. The chairman, Senator William Alden Smith, wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all surviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil, which prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was completed on 25 May. The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist, insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing "his moment to stand on the world stage". Smith, however, already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on U.S. railroads, and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan, "Titanic"s ultimate owner.
The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster was headed by Lord Mersey, and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being run by the Board of Trade who had previously approved the ship, it was seen by some as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being found negligent.
Each inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of "Titanic", crew members of Leyland Line's "Californian", Captain Arthur Rostron of "Carpathia" and other experts. The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time. The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions; the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate, Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings, the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed. 
Neither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor. The US inquiry concluded that those involved had merely followed standard practice, and the disaster could thus only be categorised as an "act of God", and the British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice which had not previously been shown to be unsafe (the inquiry noted that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives) and concluded that he had done "only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position." The British inquiry also warned that "What was a mistake in the case of the "Titanic" would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future."
The recommendations included major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock. An International Ice Patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea; both measures are still in force today.
Role of the SS "Californian".
One of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by , which had been only a few miles from "Titanic" but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to her signal rockets. "Californian" had warned "Titanic" by radio of the pack ice that was the reason "Californian" had stopped for the night, but was rebuked by "Titanic"s senior wireless operator, Jack Phillips.
Testimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10 pm, "Californian" observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10 pm) that this was a passenger liner. At 11:50 pm, the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible. Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30 pm and 1:00 am, but were not acknowledged. If "Titanic" were as far from the "Californian" as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact "Titanic" by that method. Had Lord done so, it is possible that he could have reached "Titanic" in time to save additional lives.
Captain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00 pm to spend the night; however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10 am that the ship had fired 5 rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50 am and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15 am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.
"Californian" eventually responded. At around 5:30 am, Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator Cyril Furmstone Evans, informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ship. He got news of "Titanic"s loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after "Carpathia" had already picked up all the survivors.
The inquiries found that the ship seen by "Californian" was in fact "Titanic" and that it would have been possible for "Californian" to come to her rescue; therefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.
Survivors and victims.
The number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, due to a number of factors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.
Less than a third of those aboard "Titanic" survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard "Carpathia". The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard "Titanic". Although only 3 percent of first-class women were lost, 54 percent of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. 
The last living survivor, Millvina Dean from England, who at only nine weeks old was the youngest passenger on board, died aged 97 on 31 May 2009. A special survivor was crew member Violet Jessop who survived the sinkings of both "Titanic" and "Britannic" and further was onboard "Olympic" when she was rammed in 1911.
Retrieval and burial of the dead.
Once the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship CS "Mackay-Bennett" from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to retrieve bodies. Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship "Minia", lighthouse supply ship "Montmagny" and sealing vessel "Algerine". Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.
The first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS "Mackay-Bennett" found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port. Captain Larnder of the "Mackay-Bennett" and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first class passengers, justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third class passengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder himself claimed that as a mariner, he would expect to be buried at sea.
Bodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax coroner, John Henry Barnstead, developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was set up in a curling rink and undertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist. Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150 bodies, were buried in three Halifax cemeteries, the largest being Fairview Lawn Cemetery followed by the nearby Mount Olivet and Baron de Hirsch cemeteries.
In mid-May 1912, recovered three bodies over from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A. When Fifth Officer Harold Lowe and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible A, but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants. After their retrieval from Collapsible A by "Oceanic", the bodies were buried at sea.
The last "Titanic" body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel "Algerine" on May 22 and buried at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax on June 12.
Only 333 bodies of "Titanic" victims were recovered, one in five of the over 1500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles making them difficult to recover. By June one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.
Wreck.
"Titanic" was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition. The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over below the surface, in a location where the water pressure is over 6,500 pounds per square inch. A number of expeditions were mounted to find "Titanic" but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition succeeded.
The team discovered that "Titanic" had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6 km) apart in a canyon on the continental shelf off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located from the inaccurate coordinates given by "Titanic"s radio operators on the night of her sinking, and approximately from Halifax and from New York. 
Both sections hit the sea bed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.
The two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately . It contains hundreds of thousands of items, such as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which fell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor. The debris field was also the last resting place of a number of "Titanic"s victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots—which have proved to be inedible—as the only sign that bodies once lay there.
Since its discovery, the wreck of "Titanic" has been revisited numerous times by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly in recent years, partly due to accidental damage caused by submersibles but mainly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull. It has been estimated that within the next 50 years the hull and structure of "Titanic" will collapse entirely, eventually leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.
Many artefacts from "Titanic" have been recovered from the sea bed by RMS Titanic Inc., which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and in a permanent exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. A number of other museums exhibit artefacts either donated by survivors or retrieved from the floating bodies of victims of the disaster.
On 16 April 2012, a day after the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos were released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The photos, taken by Robert Ballard during an expedition led by NOAA in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to "Titanic"'s stern which experts called "compelling evidence" that it's the spot where somebody came to rest, and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them. The wreck of the Titanic falls under the scope of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This means that all states parties to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state cooperation system, by which States inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the Titanic, and cooperate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.
Legacy.
Safety.
After the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating, that ships would carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea passed in 1914. The convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974. Signatories to the convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example in Britain, new “Rules for Life Saving Appliances” were passed by the Board of Trade on May 8, 1914 and then applied at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.
Further, United States government passed the Radio Act of 1912. This act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations. In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.
Finally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, an agency of the United States Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.
Cultural.
"Titanic" has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable. For more than 100 years she has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking memorial postcards sold in huge numbers together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers, and even black mourning teddy bears. Several survivors wrote books about their experiences but it was not until 1955 the first historically accurate book "A Night to Remember" was published. 
The first film about the disaster, "Saved from the Titanic", was released only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its star—the silent film actress Dorothy Gibson. The British film "A Night to Remember" (1958) is still widely regarded as the most historically accurate movie portrayal of the sinking, but the most successful by far has been James Cameron's "Titanic" (1997), which became the highest-grossing film in history up to that time.
The "Titanic" disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton, Liverpool and Belfast in the United Kingdom; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland. A number of museums around the world have displays on "Titanic". In Northern Ireland, the ship is commemorated by the Titanic Belfast visitor attraction, opened on 31 March 2012, that stands on the site of the shipyard where "Titanic" was built. 
RMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a permanent "Titanic" exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Nevada which features a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull. It also runs an exhibition which travels around the world. In Nova Scotia, Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic displays items that were recovered from the sea a few days after the disaster. They include pieces of woodwork such as panelling from the ship's First Class Lounge and an original deckchair, as well as objects removed from the victims. In 2012 the centenary was marked by plays, radio programmes, parades, exhibition and special trips to the site of the sinking together with commemorative stamps and coins.

Highlights in Slow Motion

Highlights in Slow Motion is an acoustic rock album by ex-60 Ft. Dolls front man Richard J. Parfitt. Released in 2002 on Rough Trade Records. The sleeve was designed by Welsh-born musician and artist Jon Langford and embossed with a quote from the poet Roger McGough: "…and Cardiff's a tart with a heart of gold". 
The album received favorable reviews in spite of a lukewarm reception. "Reflective new direction for one time Britpop hellraiser…the wistful bedsit realism of "Wish I Was With You", and the loveless companionship explored in "I Took That Woman Home Last Night", point the way for a brave and newly impressive writer". "The Daily Mirror" wrote: "…his songs contain a dreamy charm and tearful romance. A few more sunbursting riffs (the excellent "What We Talk About") and we can call him a boss. "Parfitt’s thing is croaky, tousle headed soul (Chiltern, Westerberg, Springsteen). The vocals are tremendously frayed and some of the steals are impressive. Whatever, this wooziness has a sure value’ Songs like the raw, nakedly emotionally "Downtown" or the superior Van Morrison-style conversational poetry of "Summergliding" display Parfitt's ability to mix adroit fingerpicking with purely pugilistic strumming."

Karl Joseph Brodtmann

Karl Joseph/Ioseph Brodtmann (3 February 1787 – 14 May 1862) was an accomplished Swiss artist and lithographer, as well as a printmaker, publisher and bookseller who worked in Zurich and Schaffhausen.
Brodtmann's natural history lithographs include Heinrich Rudolf Schinz's works on reptiles and birds, published in the early 1830s. Brodtmann also produced natural history lithographs, as "Naturhistorische Bilder Gallerie aus dem Thierreiche".
Brodtmann was born in Überlingen. He produced his lithographs in the post-Linnaean "'Age of Enlightenment". Natural history specimens were depicted in hand-coloured sets for the use of biologists and the aristocracy, the latter being not only great patrons of the arts and sciences, but including many who were actively interested in fauna and flora. The artists respected scientific accuracy and often displayed a remarkable sense of aesthetics. Brodtmann died, aged 75, in Basel.

Bonduelle

Bonduelle is a French company producing processed vegetables. 
For over 70 years, Bonduelle has experienced rapid, steady growth in the canned and frozen vegetables industry.
Bonduelle products are sold through traditional distribution channels (supermarkets, mini-markets, etc.) and through catering circuits (restaurants, institutional food service, school dining halls, staff canteens, etc.).
History.
The company was founded in 1853, when Louis Bonduelle-Dalle (23 October 1802 - 13 November 1880) and Louis Lesaffre-Roussel (1802–1869) established a grain and juniper berry distillery in Marquette-lez-Lille. On June 17 1862, they expanded to a farm in Renescure, which they turned into a grain alcohol distillery.
In 1901 the company and its seven production sites were divided into three family-owned companies: Bonduelle, Lesaffre and Lemaître.
In 1926, that the business began canning peas. Booming demand in the 1930s enabled the company to expand, but the firm's operations were suspended in 1940 through the end of World War II.
With the war's end, however, demand continued to grow, and the company began purchasing vegetables to supplement its own harvests.
In the mid-1960s, the company began to improve its exports, and in 1968, began freezing vegetables. Several European subsidiaries were launched: in Germany in 1969, in Italy in 1972 and in England in 1973. By 1973, exports accounted for half of the company's turnover.
In 1980, Bonduelle acquired the main Belgian canned food company, Marie Thumas, and added the acquisition of Cassegrain in 1989.
The company continued to grow internationally, adding subsidiaries in Brazil in 1994 and in Argentina in 1996.
In 1997, the company entered the "fresh processed" business with the acquisition of Salade Minute.
In 2004, Bonduelle Group created the Louis Bonduelle Foundation, which aims to promote the public usefulness of vegetables by putting the benefits of vegetables to the public good.
In 2007, Bonduelle completed its acquisition of Canadian firm Aliments Carrière (Arctic Gardens brand), a leader in vegetables and frozen foods, which enabled gave it access to 39,500 hectares of farmland.
In 2010, Bonduelle bought France Champignon, and mushrooms have become Bonduelle's number two vegetable (after sweetcorn).

John Herety

John P Herety (born 8 March 1958) is a former English racing cyclist. He rode for Great Britain in the Olympic Games and won the national road championship as an amateur and then a professional. He is currently manager of the cycling team, and occasionally provides studio-based analysis of cycle races for British Eurosport.
Biography.
Born in Cheadle, Cheshire (now in Greater Manchester), England, Herety joined Cheshire Road Club as a young teenager. His first win was in a Scouts' cyclo-cross race in Woodbank Park, Stockport. He was coached by Harold "H" Nelson and trained regularly with other local riders destined for professional careers, notably Graham Jones, Paul Sherwen and Ian Binder. Further success followed as a junior. He was known as a sprinter but he also won after breaking clear of the main field.
He came third in the in 1980 British National Road Race Championships and won the Manx Trophy. Herety, a chef, received a set of chef's knives when he won a stage of the 1980 Peace Race in Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz), a city proud of its steelworks. Herety finished 21st in the road race at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the race was won by Sergei Sukhoruchenkov.
He then joined the French team, Athletic Club Boulogne-Billancourt in Paris, Europe’s most successful sports club with fellow British riders Sean Yates and Jeff Williams. Herety won his second race for the ACBB which was a circuit of Toulon finishing in a bunch sprint.Herety spent one season with the ACBB and was offered a professional contract with Mercier riding alongside Joop Zoetemelk. In 1982 he had hoped to get a ride in the Tour de France. However, a poor performance in the Tour de l’ Aude resulted in him not being selected by the Coop-Mercier manager Jean–Pierre Danguillame. Herety subsequently returned to England and won the Professional British National Road Race Championships. He also had success in the Grand Prix Pino Cerami finishing second after being outsprinted from a small group of riders by Ronny Van Holen. However, after three seasons with Mercier he had reached a level that he was unable to improve on. Herety explained: “My trouble is that I can’t recover quickly enough after a hard stage race or a race." "When I’ m racing abroad that is no good, with so many races to ride one after the other.” In 1985 he consequently decided to join the British based professional team Ever Ready allowing him to race on the weekends and if needed have the whole week to recover. In 1986 he then joined Percy Bilton riding alongside Bob Downs and Steve Joughin. The following season he won a stage in the Milk Race and was runner up in the British National Road Race Championships. John owed his successes to his powerful sprint. However, his inability to climb and recover during hard stage races limited his palmares. Herety was not a general classification rider – evidence his 52nd overall in the 1984 Sealink International.
Herety became team manager of the Percy Bilton team after his racing career. He went on to become director of racing for British Cycling. He resigned following an inquiry into the 2005 UCI Road World Championships in Madrid, when Charly Wegelius and Tom Southam were alleged to have helped Italian riders rather than those in the British team. He was manager of Recycling.co.uk in 2006 and 2007, for 2008 this evolved into and for 2009 became Rapha Condor.
Personal life.

Media in Pretoria

Radio and TV broadcasting in Pretoria is supplied via a network of VHF/FM and UHF transmitters and repeaters owned and operated by Sentech - South Africa's state-owned broadcast signal distributor - from four transmitter sites in and around the city. A number of community radio stations operate transmitters from non-Sentech sites.
The inception of an FM broadcast service in South Africa, began on 1 September 1961 from what is now known as the Sentech Tower in Brixton, Johannesburg. The remainder of South Africa was initially served by medium wave transmitters, which were essentially localised to the larger centres. A massive drive through the 1960s and 70's saw the roll-out of the FM network to the rest of the country. Much of the original equipment supplied was through technology exchange programmes, meaning that the transmitters were of European design, but manufactured in South Africa. Original networks were based on 3kW tube FM equipment, operating into channel combining equipment to allow the use of a common transmit antenna system, with a gain of around 10-12dB. Sentech embarked on a huge programme in the late 1980s to effect replacement of these ageing FM transmitter and antenna systems. In world terms, it was the single largest contract awarded to a local manufacturer for the supply of FM transmitters.
In South Africa, digital migration still has to happen. Currently, analogue TV occupies the VHF frequencies where digital radio needs to migrate. Once digital migration is done, South Africa will have Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and listen to digital radio on the DAB system. For now, virtually all South Africans rely on analogue terrestrial (FM/AM/SW) broadcasts for their radio consumption.

Petroleum industry in Western Australia

The petroleum industry in Western Australia is the largest contributor to Australia's production of most petroleum products. Based largely on development of the reserves of the North West Shelf and other onshore hydrocarbon basins, the industry extracts crude oil, condensate and natural gas from petroleum reservoirs deep beneath the Earth's surface. A large plant located at Withnell Bay near Dampier, produces liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export to Asian customers. Crude oil and most petroleum liquids are exported, and Australia's largest petroleum refinery at Kwinana in WA's south-west, produces petrol and diesel for local consumption. Natural gas is processed at plants located on islands off the WA coast and onshore, then transported by pipelines to gas users throughout the state.
In 2007, the industry produced of crude oil/condensate, and 30 billion cubic metres of gas. 65% of the gas was transformed into 12 million tonnes of LNG (all of which was exported), with the remainder of the gas being sold to users in Western Australia. Primary production by the industry was valued at $16.7 billion, accounting for 31% of all natural resources produced in the state.
Early history.
The earliest petroleum-related activity in the state was in 1902, with the first oil exploration well drilled near the Warren River area in the southwest. Traces of oil were found in a bore near Fitzroy Crossing in 1919. Formal exploration in Western Australia started in 1946, when the Australian Motorists Petrol Company (AMPOL) commenced an exploration programme, using the services of the Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) which had been set up by the Australian government in the same year to conduct survey work. In the following year, AMPOL were awarded the first two exploration permits in Western Australia near Exmouth.
Large-scale surveys were conducted in the Canning Basin in 1947, and in the same year, Ampol secured exploration permits for the Exmouth region. Ampol formed a joint venture with Standard Oil of California. The new company was called West Australian Petroleum (WAPET), and drilled its first well at Rough Range in 1953. This well produced at a rate of , and was probably the commencement of Australia's commercial petroleum industry. In the following year, WAPET geologists conducted a basic survey of Barrow Island. They were the first civilians to visit the area since British atomic testing on the nearby Monte Bello Islands. The company achieved major commercial success with a large discovery on the island in 1964, which was followed by a large scale operation which continues to this day.
In 1966, WAPET discovered WA's first commercial quantities of natural gas near Dongara. Construction of the state's first gas pipeline was completed in 1971. The pipeline transported gas from Dongara to Perth, Kwinana and Pinjarra. Originally known as the WANG Pipeline (after WA Natural Gas Pty Ltd which was a WAPET subsidiary), it is still in operation and now known as the Parmelia Pipeline. Woodside received its first permits to explore the Carnarvon basin in 1963. The 1971 gas/condensate discoveries by the BOCAL consortium at Scott Reef, North Rankin and Goodwyn were followed by a further gas/condensate discovery at Angel in 1972.
Geology.
Five of the seven major sedimentary basins in Western Australia have known hydrocarbon accumulations,with 2007–08 production coming from the Carnarvon, Perth, Bonaparte and Canning basins. Sixty-one fields were on production during 2007–08 fiscal year. Petroleum in Western Australia is mostly sourced from the Carnarvon Basin, which stretches for 1,000 km of the west and northwest coast, from Geraldton to north of Port Hedland. In area, the onshore part of the Carnarvon Basin covers about 115,000 km² and the offshore part covers approximately 535,000 km² with water depths up to 3,500 m.
Less than 5% of the state's gas comes from fields near Dongara, part of the Perth basin, which extends about 1300 km along the southwestern margin of the continent. This is a large (172,300 km²) basin that formed during the separation of Australia and Greater India in the Permian to Early Cretaceous period. It includes a significant onshore component and extends offshore to the edge of continental crust in water depths of up to 4500 m.
The Officer basin, straddling the WA-SA border in the south-east section of the state, is a poorly explored basin, with limited seismic coverage, although more than 20 exploration wells have been drilled. A small amount of oil is produced in the Canning basin, in which 250 wells have been drilled and 78,000 line-km of 2D seismic surveys has been shot. A local company, Arc Energy, currently the largest Perth basin producer, is actively exploring and drilling in the Canning basin.
Products.
LNG.
The North West Shelf Venture (NWSV), a consortium of six energy companies led by Woodside, operates five LNG trains near Karratha. It relies on natural gas supplied from North Rankin, Goodwyn and Perseus fields in the Northwest Shelf (NWS). The majority of LNG produced by the NWSV is exported to Japan, with occasional spot sales to the United States, Spain and Korea. A fifth LNG train is currently under construction and is expected to increase export capacity by an additional 4.2 million tons, bringing total capacity to around 16 million tonnes per year. The cost of the project is estimated at $1.6 billion, with startup in late 2008.
Although the NWSV dominates Australia's LNG market, additional projects are in various stages of planning, the largest of which is the Gorgon gas project. Chevron (along with joint venture partners Shell and ExxonMobil) is considering development of the Greater Gorgon gas fields, which contain recoverable reserves of . The project entails constructing subsea pipelines from the Gorgon and Jansz fields to Australia's Barrow Island, where 3 liquefaction trains will produce 15 million tons of LNG per year.
Domestic gas.
In 2006-07, around two thirds of Australia's natural gas was produced in the Carnarvon Basin off the coast of Western Australia. Most of the gas produced in WA is transformed into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and exported to Japan. The remainder is used within the state. The domestic market for natural gas in WA, like that of Australia as a whole, is characterised by a small number of producers and a small number of large industrial consumers, with limited depth in consumption.
The state's two largest individual users of gas are Alcoa (which operates three alumina refineries in the south-west) and Burrup Fertilisers (which operates the world's largest ammonia plant on the Burrup Peninsula, near Dampier). Together they account for more than half of the natural gas consumed in WA. Most of the remaining gas is used for electricity generation and by other smaller industrial and commercial users. Residential gas users consume only about 2% of the natural gas produced in the state.
There are three main 'supply lines' for WA's domestic gas:
Petroleum liquids (Crude oil, condensate and LPG).
Oil production in Australia has increased gradually since 1980, peaking in 2000 at . In 2003, production fell dramatically to . In 2006, Australia produced approximately of oil.
Western Australia is Australia's leading oil (and condensate) producing State, having surpassed Victoria, where production from the Gippsland Basin off the southern coast has been steadily declining. Western Australia currently produces 71% of Australia's crude oil and condensate. Australian crude oil and condensate production is projected to increase in the medium term (mainly due to new supply sources in Western Australia) before declining gradually.
Sector organisation.
Similar to petroleum industries in other market-capitalist economies such as those in Western Europe and North America, the structure of the WA petroleum industry is characterised by the involvement of private corporations, with an important regulatory role occupied by the federal and state governments in most aspects of the industry. Australian companies operating in the industry include Woodside Petroleum, Santos and BHP Billiton. Foreign-owned companies involved in the state include Apache Energy, BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Inpex and ConocoPhillips.
Government.
Government involvement in the industry covers areas such as policy development, safety and environmental regulation, investment facilitation, provision of infrastructure, releases of new exploration areas, acquisition of regional geological data. The legal framework within which petroleum exploration and development occurs is a result of the division of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the states/territories under the Constitution and inter-governmental agreements (in particular, the 1978-79 Offshore
Constitutional Settlement).
Onshore, and out to 3 nm (nautical miles) from the territorial sea baseline (coastal waters), petroleum operations are the responsibility of the state government. WA's offshore areas beyond the 3 nm limit are governed by Commonwealth legislation (Offshore Petroleum Act 2005) administered by the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. The Law of the Sea Convention gives effect to a system of Exclusive Economic Zones under which nations have sovereign rights over natural resources out to 200 nm from the coast (Australia claimed such rights in 1994 under the Maritime Legislation Amendment Act 1994). The convention also allows Australia to claim sovereign rights over seabed resources where the continental shelf extends beyond 200 nm. State agencies also administer some aspects of federal petroleum-related legislation on behalf of the Commonwealth.
Production facilities.
Production refers to the process of extracting the hydrocarbons from existing wells, along with initial separation of the wellstream components (which typically include varying proportions of crude oil, natural gas, and water), prior to transportation to end-use markets or further processing and refining. Most of the state's petroleum production occurs at offshore production platforms, although many wells are situated on the mainland and on several islands off the coast such as Thevenard Island and at Barrow Island where commercial oil production in WA commenced in 1964. WA's largest production platforms are North Rankin A and Goodwyn A - both operated by Woodside Petroleum - located approximately 130 km west of Dampier, where the ocean depth is about 100 m.
Transportation.
There are currently four major natural gas transmission pipelines supplying the Western Australian gas market:
Refining.
Refining refers to the transformation of crude oil and condensate into end-use petroleum products. The state's only oil refinery, owned and operated by BP, is located at Kwinana, and was commissioned in 1955. With a production capacity of , it is the largest of Australia's seven refineries, accounting for almost 20% of national refining capacity. As most of the crude oil and condensate produced in WA is exported to Asia by ship, the Kwinana refinery relies mainly on shipments of crude oil from elsewhere in Australia and overseas. For many years, a small amount of crude oil has arrived for processing at the refinery via road tanker, having been produced at onshore wells near Dongara since the late 1960s.
The quantity of Perth basin oil production rose substantially in 2001 when the Cliff Head field (10 km off the coast near Dongara in 15 m of water) was brought into production., about 320 km north of Perth. The refinery mostly produces petrol and diesel, along with jet fuel, bitumen and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Australia's refineries have experienced declining gross margins for several years, mainly due to competition from foreign refineries, an oversupply of refining capacity in Asia, and the high cost of transporting crude oil to Australia.
Issues.
Supply disruption.
The state's heavy reliance on gas from the north west has become a prominent public issue on several occasions when disruptions to supply has occurred. On 18 February 2004, Western Power (electricity provider) imposed compulsory restrictions on power usage in Perth. This occurred on a day when the temperature was expected to reach nearly 42°C and the company was unable to use its 'peakload' gas-fired power stations because of maintenance being carried out on the main pipeline from the north-west.
On 2 January 2008, an electrical fault resulted in a production shutdown at the North West Shelf Venture's Karratha Gas Plant. Production resumed on 4 January and normal gas supplies was re-established by 6 January 2008. It was a complete shutdown affecting both LNG exports and domestic gas production. Domestic gas supplies were cut by 2/3.
The most serious and significant disruption occurred in June 2008, when a pipeline rupture and explosion at the Varanus Island facility caused a 3-month shutdown of the plant, reducing the state's supply of natural gas by one-third.
Domestic gas reservation policy.
In 2006, the state government announced a policy requiring that future developers of export gas projects set aside 15% of the reserves in each gas field for domestic use within the state. This policy replicated the initial State Agreement for the North West Shelf Project, and was based on a perceived decline in the availability of gas from non-export developments. For developers of large export projects, LNG exports generally offer higher returns than sales of gas into the domestic market. A federal parliamentary report referred to the state policy, stating that "while Western Australia presently consumes about 35% of Australia's domestic gas use, and the bulk of LNG exports, there is still a very healthy reserves-to-production ratio in excess of 100 years.
Garnaut Climate Change Review.
Australia's ratification of the kangaroo Protocol treaty in March 2008 is likely to increase the country's use of natural gas to displace more carbon-dioxide-intensive coal. The first draft report of the Garnaut Climate Change Review (released on 4 July 2008), which identified the impacts of climate change on Australia and proposed numerous public policy measures designed to mitigate these effects, may have a significant impact on aspects of the industry. Among the measures proposed was an emissions trading scheme "which will make higher-emissions forms of energy generation more expensive, shifting demand towards lower-emissions sources, and towards technologies that capture and sequester emissions...and in transport, an emissions trading scheme will make higher-emissions forms of transport more expensive, shifting demand to lower-emissions forms"
Security.
The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has identified petroleum facilities in WA(Western Australia), including offshore platforms, ports, processing plants and pipelines as potential targets of military or terrorist attack. Offshore structures and floating production and storage vessels have few defences against attack. In a 2005 report on maritime security threats, the Institute noted thaend in Australian petroleum production from onshore to offshore and from Bass Strait to the Northwest Shelf posed increasing risks for the Western Australian petroleum industry. In December 2004 the Australian Government announced a program of augmented security patrols in the Northwest Shelf area.

Raja Desingu

Raja Desingu () is a Tamil language film starring M. G. Ramachandran, S. S. Rajendran, P. Bhanumathi and Padmini in the lead roles. The film was released in 1960.
Production.
Gingee or Senji has a long history since 200 BC and over the years had been invaled and ruled by many dominant kingdoms. However, the one name that invariably crops up at any mention of Senji is that of Raja Desingu, who ruled the kingdom, albeit for a short period, with sagacity and valour in the 18th century. Over the years, the saga of Raja Desingu has been become an enduring and endearing part of Tamil folklore. Countless ballads, stories, puppet shows, dance, stage and street shows have been inspired by the tragic tale of this brave hero of Senji. 
Adapted as a movie in 1936 by Rajeswari Talkies and was directed by Raja Chandrasekhar. The lead actors were T. K. Sundarappa, V. S. Mani, M. Lakshmi and K. R. Saradambal. The lyrics by Madurai Baskaradoss and music by M. Baluswami.
Plot.
Swaroop Singh (O. A. K. Thevar) won the respect and loyalty of the people of Senji during his rule where Hindus and Muslims lived in peace and prosperity. A son was born to Swaroop Singh and his wife Rambai (Rushyendramani), whom they named Tej Singh pronounced as Desingu (MGR) in Tamil. Swaroop Singh has a secret wife called Jaan Bibi (Lakshmiprabha), and they have a son called Dawood Khan (MGR) who was a little older than Desingu. Fearing that Dawood might pose a threat to the succession of the throne in years to come, on the advice of his commander and close confidant Yusuf Khan (T. K. Ramachandran), Swaroop Singh persuades Jaan Bibi to leave Senji, taking little Dawood with her. Desingu who has integrity and courage grows up with his childhood friend, another brave young man called Mohammed Khan (S. S. Rajendran), and two are always inseparable. 
At this juncture, the Sultan of Delhi (M. G. Chakrapani) offers to free any state coming under his dominion whose ruler manages to tame a wild horse in his stable. Hearing this in the intention to have a free kingdom, Swaroop Singh leaves to Delhi without letting know Rambai and Desingu. Despite trying very hard, he failed to tame the wild horse and imprisoned by the Sultan of Delhi. Upon hearing this, the minister (Karikkol Raju) informs Desingu who rushes to Delhi where he meets his uncle Bheem Singh’s (M. R. Santhanam) for advice. The dauntless Desingu manages to tame the stallion and ride it, to the loud cheers of the huge audience. Filled with admiration, the Sultan frees Swaroop Singh who had earlier failed in this endeavour and gives them a written proclamation of Senji’s independence. Desingu marries Ranibai (P. Bhanumathi) who is Bheem Singh’s daughter. Pandiyan (K. A. Thangavelu) who works in the horse stable comes along to Senji and works as assistant to Mohamad Khan’s father and falls in love and marries Sengkamalam (M. N. Rajam) who is also Mohamad Khan’s adopted sister.
Meanwhile, growing up as an illegitimate child, Dawood vows to rule Senji some day. But in her deathbed, Jaan Bibi extracts a promise from Dawood that he would not cause any harm to Desingu. Dawood goes to Arcot and wins the confidence of the Nawab when he rescues the Nawab’s infant son from being crushed under an elephant’s feet. The grateful Nawab appoints him as his general. When Dawood expresses his determination to subjugate Senji, the Nawab expresses his helplessness, stating that nothing could be done as long as Desingu has the written proclamation of Senji’s independence in his custody. It is around the same time that Desingu dismisses his general Yusuf Khan from service when he is caught trying to commit adultery molesting Sengkamalam. Abetted by the humiliated Yusuf Khan who has now turned traitor, Dawood makes use of his striking resemblance to Desingu and extracts the written parchment from the unsuspecting wife of Desingu. 
When Mohammed Khan falls in love with the pretty Ayisha (Padmini), he anticipates no opposition from his parents for the match. However, he finds that his mother (T. A. Madhuram) and father (N. S. Krishnan) have each identified a girl of their own choice to be his wife. When he informs them that he has already chosen his life partner, his father proposes that they go the queen for an appropriate decision. Ranibai asks each of them to write down the name of the girl they have in mind, and then discovers that all 3 of them have written Ayisha’s name.
When the royal astrologer (P. G. Vengkadasalam) suggests that Desingu and Ranibai be separated for 3 years as an antidote for the inauspicious placement of their stars, Desingu pours scorn upon such beliefs. However, considering the welfare of Senji and heeding to his mother’s plea, Desingu is forced to consent to such separation. He carries on stolidly with his responsibilities as the ruler of Senji during the day.
The nawab od Arcot and Dawood Khan sents in (T. S. Balaiah) to meet Desingu to request Senji kingdom to pay tax. Desingu announces in agony that Senji would not bow to the Sulytanate of Delhi. Now that Senji had no proof of its independence, Arcot declares war on Senji for non-payment of taxes. Under the resolute leadership of Mohammed Khan, Senji emerges triumphant in warding off the Arcot forces. But even as Mohammed Khan fetches water to quench the thirst of a dying soldier of Arcot, Yusuf Khan shoots him from the back. And not satisfied with dastardly act, Yusuf Khan kills Mohammed Khan’s fiancée Ayisha who had come to the battlefield in search of her beloved. Wanting the brothers to fight against each other now, Yusuf Khan carries false reports to Desingu that it was Dawood who killed Mohammed Khan. Athirst with revenge for the death of his friend, Desingu rushes to the warfront and soon challenges Dawood to a duel. Dawood is hesitant to fight with his brother, and even advises Desingu that they could leave the fighting to their troops. But Desingu is no mood to listen and soon the brothers are engaged in a bitter duel. Handicapped by his oath not to harm Desingu, Dawood is soon vanquished and lies mortally wounded. Desingu’s delight is short-lived, for Yusuf Khan now informs him that Dawood is none other than his brother. Adding to his grief at the death of his friend, Desingu is horrified at having killed his brother, and in a moment of abject remorse, kills himself. The Nawab’s troops now enter the fort in victory, and Desingu’s brave wife Ranibai commits Sati.

Yuri language (Amazon)

Yurí (Jurí) is, or was, a language previously spoken near a stretch of the Caquetá River in the Brazilian Amazon, extending slightly into Colombia. A small amount of data was collected on two occasions in the 19th century, in 1853 and 1867. Kaufman (1994:62, after Nimuendajú 1977:62) notes that there is lexical evidence to support a link with Ticuna in a Ticuna–Yurí language family, though the data has never been explicitly compared (Hammarström 2010). 
It is commonly assumed that the Yuri people and language survive among the uncontacted people or peoples the Rio Puré region, now the Río Puré National Park. Indeed, "Yuri" is often used as a synonym for the only named people in the area, the Carabayo. A list of words collected n 1969 from the, or one of the, Río Puré peoples was 20% cognate with Yuri, suggesting the possibility of a Rio Pure language family though not direct descent (Hammarström 2010).

One (video game)

One is a video game released for the Sony PlayStation in 1997. The game was released as a PSone Classic for download on the PlayStation Network on March 18, 2010.
Gameplay.
There are six levels in total with a Boss character to face at the end of each; most of whom cannot be dispatched by direct gunfire and instead must be defeated by usage of the surrounding environment.
The game is a modern variation of the side-scrolling platformer gernre. Unlike third-person games like "Tomb Raider" players here primarily move on a 2D plane, but the world is rendered in 3D and the camera will zoom in and out for cinematic effect.
Plot.
The goal of "One" is for the player to discover the identity of the main character John Cain. The only clue available is a barcode on the player-character's neck. At the beginning of the game, John Cain awakens on the floor of an apartment building, with a gun in place of one arm, no memory, and police helicopters shooting missiles through a window. The player is pursued across the city and country-side by military and police forces who are apparently intending to kill Cain. To combat the police and military forces and other enemies, the player has the option to use Cain's newly installed arm cannon, or rely on more traditional fighting weapons like punch and kicking combos.

Vrav

Vrav ( ; also "Vrǎv" or "Vruv"; ) is a village in northwestern Bulgaria, part of Bregovo municipality, Vidin Province. Located on the right bank of the Danube at the place where the Timok River empties into it, Vrav is the northernmost populated place in Bulgaria and the first Bulgarian port along the Danube's course. The village has a Romanian population and lies 30 kilometres from the provincial capital Vidin and 12 kilometres from Bregovo.
As of 2008, the village has a population of 423. and the mayor is Sofroni Nikov. Vrav is situated at , at an elevation of 42 metres above mean sea level.
Vrav lies opposite the Romanian village Gârla Mare in Mehedinţi County, to which the residents of Vrav are related through kinship ties. The area is known for its characteristic "horo" dance. The locals are part of the ethnographic group of the "wet Vlachs" (мокри власи, "mokri vlasi"), known as such because they live at the confluence of the Timok and the Danube, to contrast them with the "bushy Vlachs" (рунтави власи, "runtavi vlasi") of the mountains to the southwest along the Serbian border. The population is Eastern Orthodox and speaks an old Romanian dialect or "Vlach language" alongside Bulgarian. According to some researchers, the Vlachs came to those areas in the 18th century. They declare themselves to be Bulgarians, however, as the 2001 census recorded only 155 Vlachs and 16 Romanians in the entire Vidin Province.
There are some Ancient Roman ruins near the village, presumably part of the Danubian limes: to the west was the Roman post of "Dorticum" and to the east was what the locals call "chetate" ("cetate", "fortress"). Vrav already existed in the early 18th century, as it was marked on Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli's map of the area of 1711. According to semi-legendary evidence, the village was founded by seven refugee families from the Banat, with the remainder of the population coming from the surrounding Vlach villages in Serbia and Romania. Its old name was "Kosheritse", but as the locals moved it to a hilltop, they changed the name accordingly. In 1900, the village had a population of 1,974 and in 1926: 2,178.

Plot.
Kalai Arasi' is a well-blended story of romance, science fiction, action and drama with the main cast of MGR and Bhanumathi essaying double roles.
Mohan is a poor, but honest and hard-working farmer. Vani is the daughter of the rich landlord who lives in the city while their lands are under the supervision of her cousin and suitor, the wily Kannan. On a visit to the village with her friends, Vani meets Mohan. Mohan and Vani find themselves falling in love with each other gradually.
Meanwhile a spacecraft is moving rapidly towards the earth. Inside are two alien creatures who resemble earthly humans. From their conversation we understand that they are traveling to the earth on a strange mission. Apparently their planet has made far-reaching strides in science, but is woefully backward in performing arts. Hence they are coming to the earth to identify and take back a talented artiste who could teach their denizens music and dance. As they near the earth, one of the aliens, Thinna, who is the commander-in-chief of their planet, switches on a monitor, and the screen shows music and dance performances in various parts of the earth. He seems to be dissatisfied with them all, until he comes across Vani singing. He is mesmerized with her performance and decides that she would best suit their purpose.
Returning home after a clandestine moonlight rendezvous with Mohan, Vani falls into the clutches of the aliens. Thinna drags her inside the spacecraft, while the other alien Malla elects to stay on in the earth for a while. Vani is shocked when she finds herself far away from the earth. The king of the alien planet assures her that she will return safely after she had taught them dance and music. Vani is defiant and furious. However, princess Rajini treats her kindly and Vani agrees to teach her. Meanwhile back in the earth Vani’s father blames Kannan for Vani’s disappearance. Kannan goes in search of Vani and comes across a mentally deranged girl called Valli who bears a startling resemblance to Vani. Assuming that she is Vani, he gets her kidnapped and brings her home. Saddened to see his daughter a lunatic, Vani’s father agrees for Kannan to get married to her, and thus Kannan marries the poor Valli, under the assumption that he is marrying the rich heiress Vani.
Mohan spies the alien Malla one night as Malla is getting ready to return to his planet. They have a brief skirmish and Malla dies. Thinna lands in his spacecraft just then to take Malla home. He sees Malla’s corpse and places it in an ante-chamber inside the craft. Watching all this, Mohan enters the craft quickly, and dragging Malla’s corpse out, he jumps into the ante-chamber. Thinna does not notice this and takes off from the earth. When he nearing his planet, he ejects what he assumes to be Malla’s corpse from his spacecraft, but it is actually Mohan who falls into the alien planet. By happenstance Mohan comes across a kind-hearted jester from another planet who is on the way to the palace. This jester takes Mohan to his house and feeds him. As they step outside, the jester is struck dead by a passing meteor. As luck would have it, the jester had resembled Mohan in facial features, and so Mohan takes his place and goes to the palace. There he meets Vani and manages to make her realize his true identity. They outwit the cunning Thinna and return to the earth. Meanwhile Kannan is caught strangling Valli and is arrested by the police. Mohan and Vani reach home. All is well that ends well.

John Whitgift Academy

John Whitgift Academy (formerly known as Whitgift School) is a co-educational secondary school with academy status on "Crosland Road" in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, England.
Admissions.
The school became the John Whitgift Academy in September 2011. The Principal is Mr Mark Rushby. There are around 800 pupils. It serves the areas of Great Coates, The Willows and Wybers Wood. It is situated in the Great Coates district on the western outskirts of Grimsby near the A1136 and around 500m from a railway station, easily accessed via the A1136 Europarc interchange of the A180. It is an undersubscribed school. It is in the parish of St Nicholas, Great Coates.
History.
It is named after John Whitgift, a native of Grimsby and Archbishop of Canterbury from 1583 to 1604. It opened in September 1971. "Crosland Road" where the school was built, was named after the former (pre-1977) MP for Great Grimsby, who implemented Comprehensive Education across the UK, specifically removing most grammar schools. Until April 1974 it was administered by the County Borough of Grimsby Education Committee, then Humberside Education Committee in Beverley. The school became known as Whitgift Comprehensive School.
Threat of Closure.
It was threatened with closure in 2006 but in February 2007 won a reprieve.
Whitgift Film Theatre.
From 1992 to 2000, it was known as "Grimsby Screen". The cinema was bought from (former) Grimsby council when it was going to be closed by a group of amateurs who also had in their possession a large film library. The commercial operation briefly closed in April 2005 due to competition from the nine-screen Parkway Cinema in Cleethorpes which opened in November 2004 but the group of amateurs stepped in two weeks later. It used to be Grimsby's only cinema, until the Odeon was re-opened as The Regal on Freeman Street. It is now equipped with DTS digital sound.
Academic performance.
Like most schools in Grimsby, it does not have a sixth form.
Vertical Learning.
Whitgift's learning system was changed in 2006, when the tutor forms became "vertical", meaning that Year 7, Year 8, Year 9, Year 10 and Year 11 students are in tutor forms together, rather than "horizontal" tutor forms, whereby there is only one year group in each form. The system was then changed again in June 2008, to include GCSE classes consisting of Year 9 and Year 10 students in one class. The GCSE courses were also condensed from two-year courses to one-year courses. This meant that instead of choosing only two options at GCSE to study over two years, students could choose two options per year for three years, so students have the chance to study 4 more GCSEs than usual. The system was changed again in June 2009, so Year 9, Year 10, and Year 11 students were in the same GCSE classes. The year before, Year 11 students carried on with the old curriculum, so could not participate in the vertical system.
Academic performance.
Whitgift School's 2008 results were its best ever, achieving 37% 5A*-Cs including English & Maths. It is the fourth best performing secondary school in the LEA (out of the twelve).

Dodge Phoenix

The Dodge Phoenix is an automobile which was produced by Chrysler Australia from 1960 to 1973.
The Phoenix was introduced in May 1960 as an Australian assembled version of the American Dodge Dart, positioned above the locally developed Chrysler Royal as Chrysler Australia’s luxury model. It borrowed its name from the top Dart, the Dodge Dart Phoenix, but unlike its American namesake it was offered only as a four-door sedan and only with a 318 cubic inch V8 engine. 
The Phoenix was subsequently restyled in line with the 1961 and 1962 Dodge Dart. For 1963 the new TD2 series Phoenix was derived from the US Dodge 440, and for 1965 and beyond the Phoenix was based on the Canadian Plymouth Fury III. Like the 1965 Fury, the 1965 Phoenix featured vertically stacked headlamps. A four-door hardtop body style joined the sedan in 1967. The hardtop was fitted with a 383 cubic inch V8 engine whilst the sedan continued with the smaller 318 cubic inch V8. The two body styles continued to be offered until the final Australian Phoenix was built in 1973. 
Although the 1965 and later Phoenixes were basically Furys, they did feature the North American style full size Dodge Polara instrument panel (adapted for right hand drive). They also continued to use the old-fashioned "clapper" windshield wipers (while North American models used modern parallel-action wipers). 
The Australian developed Chrysler by Chrysler then inherited the role of the top level luxury model in Chrysler’s Australian range.

Julien of Toulouse

Jean Julien known as Julien of Toulouse (1750 in Nîmes – 1828) was a deputy to the National Convention and a political figure in the French Revolution.
Life.
A Protestant minister in Toulouse at the outbreak of the Revolution, in September 1792 Julien was elected as deputy for the département of Haute-Garonne at the National Convention which voted for the death of Louis XVI. He was next sent on a mission to Orléans and the Vendée, in which he acted as a committed Montagnard, before becoming a member of the Committee of General Security, in which he was put in charge of a report on the rebel and federalist administrators who resisted the events of 31 May. Due to this report Robespierre accused him of being a feuillant and counter-revolutionary, but Julien retracted his report and assured him he had been deceived.
Orders were then put out for his arrest for fraud or trafficking his opinions and speculating in financial companies with Chabot, Basire and Delaunay, but he managed to evade arrest and designated as a foreign agent and outlaw. After 9 Thermidor and Robespierre's fall, he appealed against his proscription, which he attributed to his hatred for Robespierre. On Marec's suggestion (full of praise for Julien), the Convention revoked his status as an outlaw but did not allow him to re-enter the legislative assembly. Included in the proscription of 18 Brumaire, he was momentarily arrested and condemned to deportation, but this measure was not carried out and Julien went back to obscurity, from which he would never return. Forced to leave France in 1816 after the Bourbon Restoration, he was unable to remain in Switzerland and so took refuge in Turin.

Masrour Barzani

Masrour Barzani (Kurdish: مه‌سروور بارزانی، Mesrúr Barzaní, Arabic: مسرور بارزاني) is a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party leadership, son of the current Kurdistan Region President Masoud Barzani, and director of intelligence and security in Iraqi Kurdistan. The KDP is one of the three main Kurdish parties in Kurdistan, and is a member of the current coalition government.
He joined the Kurdish resistance fighters, known as Peshmerga or “those who face death", in 1985 at the age of 16. As such, he was an active participant in the infamous Battle of Khwakurk against Saddam Hussein’s army in 1988. He also participated in the 1991 uprising against Saddam Hussein after the first Gulf War and filmed both events.
Despite this irregular childhood given the tumultuous nature of the Kurdish resistance, Barzani was able to complete his high school education in Iran. After seeing peace restored to the region in 1992, he went to London for a year-long course in English. Having successfully completed this, he continued on to receive a bachelor’s degree with honors in International Studies from the American University in Washington, D.C. He continued studying Peace and Conflict Resolutions for his post graduate studies.
During his time in Washington, Barzani was actively involved in improving understanding of the Kurdish plight in America. He also established a Barzani Scholar-in-Residence program at American University, in order to continue these efforts into the future.
In 1998, he returned to Kurdistan and was elected by the KDP's 12th Congress to the Central Committee. Later that same year he became part of the Kurdistan Democratic Party Leadership before receiving his current appointment as the General Director of the Protection and Intelligence Agency.
In 2010, he received the highest votes of the 13th Congress and was reelected to the Leadership Council and then selected as one of the Politburo members of the KDP.
Barzani is married and has three children, two sons and one daughter. He is fluent in Kurdish, Persian and English in addition to understanding Arabic.
Under his stewardship, women have been officially added to the Kurdish security services and many can now be seen publicly serving as guards outside government buildings.
He was a vocal critic of many of the proposals found in the Iraq Study Group, authoring a Washington Post op-ed on the subject. He has also appeared in several television interviews on security-related matters.
Masrour Barzani has also been credited with working to ensure that veterans of the Kurdish struggle who are members of his father's political party receive their pensions.
In a January 2010 interview with the Jamestwon Foundation, Masrour Barzani said that the Iraqi Constitution has laid out a clear solution for the status of the city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas.

Platinum Koala

The Platinum Koala is an Australian platinum bullion coin minted by the Perth Mint and is the most famous series of platinum coins of Australia. The Platinum Koala is notionally legal tender, that is a legal means of payment (in Australia).
On 18 June 1987, the Australian Government approved the minting of platinum and silver coins. This decision was made based on the success of gold coins issued a year earlier. The minting of the coin began in September 1988 in Perth and in 1989 the Platinum Koala arguably became the world’s "largest selling and first international tradeable investment coin". For marketing purposes, 2 ounce, 10 ounce and 1 kilogram coins of silver, gold and platinum were introduced in 1991; the 1 kg coins were the world's heaviest bullion coins at the time. Together with the American Platinum Eagle, the Platinum Koala is one of the very few series of platinum coins which are still being produced. Minting of 1/10 and 1/2 oz 2010 coins has been announced and will not exceed 2,500 and 1000 pieces, respectively. However, it will be enriched with the new 1/10 and 1/2 oz animal-related platinum coins depicting platypus, frill-necked lizard, saltwater crocodile, wombat, echidna, brolga, dolphin and kangaroo. All these coins have coloured backgrounds.
The obverse depicts the Queen of Australia, Elizabeth II, and the reverse contains an image of a koala. The initials JB of the reverse face designer James Brown are present on most coins. Other designers of the coin include Raphael Maklouf (1990, 1991, 1996, 1998), Miranda Cornell (1998) and Darryl Bellotti (2010). The annual series contain coins weighing from 1/20 ounce to 1 kilogram. 
The Platinum Koala never reached the popularity of the American Platinum Eagle, mostly because it has not been advertised in the US. Like most investment platinum coins, Platinum Koalas are sealed in a protective plastic case. The coins are sold at prices that reflect the current price of platinum, and not at the face value printed on the coin. Since November 1986, Perth Mint has used more than 18 tonnes of platinum for minting. About 85% of them were sold abroad making the Gold Corporation (owner of the Mint) one of Australia's top 30 export earners.

Alfons Novickis (1906 - 3 November 1931 in Riga) was a Latvian footballer.
Biography.
Novickis rose to fame as a great footballing talent aged just 15 when he worked as a paper-boy at a publishing company. His first senior football club was LNJS Riga for which he played in 1926.

In total Novickis played 9 international matches for Latvia national football team between 1929 and 1931.
Just as quickly as Novickis' star had risen in Latvian football, he fell down. After a 0-6 loss to Sweden in a friendly match on 26 July 1931 Novickis along with several other Latvian internationals made a bad public appearance under alcohol on the way back to Riga and as a result of it Novickis and Alberts Tauriņš were disqualified by the Latvian Football Federation for a year.
In the autumn of 1931 Novickis joined the army and on November 3 he committed suicide by shooting himself. It was later speculated that Novickis had killed himself because of some unknown disease and alcohol.

Harrington Park Press

History.
For almost 20 years, Harrington Park Press (HPP) was the LGBT imprint of The Haworth Press, Inc. (now part of the Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group). During this period of time, HPP copublished hundreds of scholarly Haworth Press monographs and texts in paperback editions and distributed them to bookstores for the general public. The imprint boasted its own distribution network through five regional sales teams plus specialty distribution in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and elsewhere.
In addition to LGBT titles, the imprint also copublished professional books in health care and self-help.
As part of the mutually successful negotiated sale agreement between Haworth Press and the Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group, it was agreed that the Harrington Park Press imprint and trademark would be retained by Bill Cohen (Founding Publisher of Haworth Press) for future business purposes.
The current effort aims to retain the heritage of Harrington Park Press. Although its focus will be on specialized academic and scholarly titles, its program will be, whenever possible, to provide simultaneous ebook coeditions to potentially broader readerships.
Harrington Park Press (HPP) aims to maximize dissemination of research and impact in the scholarly and practitioner community, while at the same time taking advantage of the global reach increasingly made possible through e-book co-publication.
Formats.
Printed Books.
The printed book remains the focal point of archival achievement. It must still be promoted and marketed through traditional but targeted direct mail, and where possible, through e-mail “blasts.” Attention will be paid to the different methods of distribution in North America as against other parts of the world still serviced by the conventional book trade (stock-holding specialized bookstores).
E-books.
The digitized book, accessible both online and downloaded to e-readers such as Kindle and Nook, is still very much in flux. HPP is convinced, however, that it has become a permanent part of the publishing landscape. E-books are amenable to broader but targeted publicity efforts, and may simplify the dilemmas of content “chunking” (finding that a book is being distributed non-commercially in parts). HPP will aim to promote its electronic editions in the same manner as aggressively as its printed work. Its task will be to identify and ally with new sorts of book reviewers, bloggers, listserves, social media, and both frontier and emerging channels that are receptive to the focus, content, accessibility and subject being covered.
The goal will be to help each author achieve and exceed their ambitions and aspirations for their work.
Officers.
Owner/Publisher – Bill Cohen.
Bill Cohen graduated from Columbia College (Class of ’71) with an undergraduate degree in psychology. He jumped directly into the publishing industry with Human Sciences Press, now part of Plenum Press, a division of Springer Science+Business Media. Starting as a clerk-typist, Bill became Director of Marketing within a year, and was in charge of all publicity and sales efforts for academic journal and book titles, managing a direct mail campaign reaching one million pieces a year. At the age of 26, Bill left Human Sciences Press, Inc. with its President, Patrick McLaughlin, to launch The Haworth Press, Inc. The name was taken from the township of Haworth in the United Kingdom, which was home to the famous literary Bronte Sisters
Haworth Press began in Bill’s bedroom office. From 1975 to 2006, the firm grew from one peer-review academic journal to almost 200, and published almost 5,000 monographs and texts, based in a multi-building office system with almost 200 employees in Binghamton, New York and Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Its imprint, Harrington Park Press, focused on “cross-over” titles of interest to both academics and the educated public, with a special strength in pioneer LGBT topics as well as in psychology and health care. In 1994, Bill bought out Patrick’s shares in the firm and moved it forward under single ownership. Patrick died several years later after a long illness. In early 2007, Bill divested the firm to the Taylor & Francis Group/Routledge, and joined with them in a consulting capacity for two years. He retained ownership and trademark rights to Harrington Park Press. The imprint continues with this effort.
Senior Editor – Dr. Richard Koffler.
Dr. Koffler brings over 30 years of distinguished editorial/publishing experience to the Press, with a solid background in the social sciences and health care, amongst other disciplines. His academic career includes a B.A. from Yale University, an M.A. from New York University, and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Rutgers University, followed by Fulbright and Old Dominion Fellowships. Subsequently he taught at MIT, and then served as Program Officer for Publications at the National Endowment for the Humanities. Dr. Koffler followed up his tenure as Vice President, Editorial for Associate Faculty Press/Kraus with a brief stint as Executive Editor for Rowman & Littlefield and a long and fruitful period as Executive Editor for Aldine de Gruyter, the American division of Walter de Gruyter of Berlin, Germany. Afterward he joined the relatively new firm at Questia Media of Houston, Texas, as Director, Publisher Relations. More recently, Dr. Koffler joined The Haworth Press, Inc., as Senior Book Editor. After the sale of Haworth to the Taylor & Francis Group/Routledge, Dr. Koffler has been teaching Humanities courses at Fairleigh Dickinson University in addition to his position as Senior Book Editor with Harrington Park Press.
Some years back, Dr. Koffler also held the position of Executive Director for the Association of American University Presses, serving as chief executive and Board Member for that leading educational nonprofit organization.
Associate Editor – Dody Riggs.
Dody Riggs was Production Manager of Harvard Education Press (HEP), the publishing arm of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, for nearly two decades, before retiring from the university in 2008. Her career began 38 years ago at Electronic Engineering Times, where she started out as a typesetter and rose quickly to become Associate Manager Editor. In the 1980s she was an Editorial Production Coordinator at Time magazine and Production Editor of Adweek, and then took a sabbatical to volunteer with various organizations overseas.. Dody is both an editorial work-flow manager and copy editor. She managed production of all Harvard Education Press products, including negotiating with vendors, overseeing designers and other freelancers, and working closely with authors to help them keep their projects moving forward. During her tenure at HEP she copy edited 70 issues of the esteemed Harvard Educational Review, more than 70 books, and countless issues of the award-winning Harvard Education Letter.
Operations Manager – Art Lizza.
Art Lizza studied philosophy at St. Bonaventure University and later at New York University. After a short stint at Prentice-Hall, he began his major 27-year career at Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, an important mid-sized academic and scholarly publishing house specializing in psychology and the behavioral sciences, as well as in education and curriculum studies, and in communication.
At LEA Art rose to the position of Senior Vice President of Production. In that capacity he was ultimately responsible for overseeing production of 200 books a year as well as 100 academic journals, and as many as 300 reprint titles annually. Many journals were published on behalf of scholarly membership societies. He supervised 45 personnel, managing end-to-end production, including art, outsourcing contracts, marketing and promotions, digital reproduction, and the titles database. He also contributed to IT direction, annual budgetary forecasting, marketing strategy, and negotiating overseas contracts.

Aayirathil Oruvan (1965 film)

Aayirathil Oruvan (), also spelt as Ayirathil Oruvan, is a 1965 Indian swashbuckling action-adventure film in Tamil language, directed by B.R. Panthulu. Starring M. G. Ramachandran and Jayalalitha in the lead roles, the film further stars other widely known actors such as M. N. Nambiar, R. S. Manohar, Nagesh and Madhavi. It ran more than 100 days in Chennai in all the theatres released and other major cities. The Director B.R. Panthulu was suffering from debts in view of the losses incurred by Kappalotiya Thamilan and Karnan produced with huge cost, and this film made him to pay all the debts and became free from debts. This film made M.G.R. - Jayalalitha pair the best one and they acted together in 28 films. Even now it fetches good collection wherever re-released.
Plot.
The story is based on the story of sea-pirates and independence achieved against a cruel tyrant. Manimaran (MGR), is a "Maruththuvar" (Doctor) living in "Neidhal Naadu" with his sidekick Azhaga (Nagesh). He helps cure the illness of one of the rebels against the dictator (Manohar) of "Neidhal Naadu". The ruler's guards arrest the rebels, along with Manimaran for helping them. Manimaran and the rebels are sold as slaves by the ruler to the nearby island called "Kanni Theevu" (Tamil for Virgin Islands), ruled by Sengappan. Manimaran leads the slaves, and fights for their rights.
Poongodi (Jayalalitha), daughter of Sengappan, falls in love with Manimaran at the first sight. Simultaneously, her servant Thenmozhi (Madhavi) falls for Azhagan, after initial arguments. Despite the differences between Poongodi and Manimaran, Poongodi tries to woo him on many occasions. She even offers freedom from slavery only to him, who rejects the offer demanding freedom for all of the slaves. Meanwhile, the island is attacked by pirates headed by a leader (Nambiar). As Sengappan's troops are out of the island on another assignment, Sengappan pleads with Manimaran and the other slaves to help him. Manimaran demands freedom slavery in return for fighting the pirates, only to be betrayed later.
The slaves make an escape plan of their own and successfully take over the pirate ship, with whom they fought earlier. Manimaran explains to the pirate captain/leader, about their plight and asks him to help them reach "Neidhal Naadu". The captain, apparently agrees, while actually taking them to his pirate island and holds them captive. He coerces them to work for him as pirates or Manimaran will see all of his other men die before him. With no option in place, Manimaran agrees to work as a pirate to escape the situation. In one of his pirate hunts, he finds Sengappan and Poongodi. He brings Poongodi to the pirate island, and tries to hide her from the pirate leader. Nanjappan, the right hand of the pirate leader, finds out tells the leader about Poongodi. As per the policy of the island, any treasure pirated must be auctioned and so Poongodi is also auctioned. After a tight bidding, Manimaran bids the highest, buys her and keeps her with him.
After few dramatic events, Manimaran gets married to Poongodi and as per the pirate island's laws the pirate leader cannot attempt to separate a married couple. The pirate leader attempts to take Poongodi by force, gets defeated by Manimaran in a sword fight and reforms into a good man. He accompanies the slaves led by Manimaran, to achieve their goal of freeing their motherland "Neidhal Naadu" from the clutches of its cruel dictator. In the ensuing war, the dictator is defeated but tricks into arresting them instead. However, in his court the dictator begs Manimaran to take over the throne. Everyone else also supports the idea. However, Manimaran politely rejects the offer and further states that he wants to continue his noble work as a doctor, serving the people. He then takes leave from the royal court and walks away with his wife and his med kit.
Production.
"Aayirathil Oruvan" was launched in 1965, and was M. G. Ramachandran's first film with director B. R. Panthulu. It was also the first film which featured him alongside the-then 14-year old newcomer Jayalalithaa, who was previously seen in her debut film "Vennira Aadai". The duo subsequently starred together frequently in later films. Panthulu, who faced losses from his previous "Karnan", compensated for it through this film. "Aayirathil Oruvan" is said to be inspired from the 1935 swashbuckling Errol Flynn starrer, "Captain Blood", and also from Burt Lancaster's "The Crimson Pirate", which itself was inspired by the 1926 film "The Black Pirate".
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of the film has been composed by Viswanathan Ramamoorthy. It is the final film where the duo worked together, they subsequently composed for later films individually.
Reception.
"Aayirathil Oruvan" was very well received by critics. M. G. Ramachandran's performance as a kind, noble, and brave leader later helped him build a massive reputation in his political career. "IndiaGlitz" stated that, "Revolutionary Leader MGR's flawless performance, Nambiar's odious crimes, Jaylalitha's lovable attitude, Nagesh's tummy tickling fun and M.S.Viswanathan's Music made the movie a unforgettable one and paved way for MGR's Political career."
Re-release.
Forty-nine years after the original theatrical release, the film is currently being digitally enhanced for a planned re-release in January 2014. Apart from scope conversion from 35mm to digital scope, the film will also have a completely re-recorded background music played out by an assistant of M. S. Viswananthan. The digital conversion is done by Prasad EFX, Chennai, who had previously done the restoration for "Karnan" and "Paasa Malar". Since the negatives were entirely damaged, the entire running length is being converted. The film is distributed by Divya Films which had earlier released the Sivaji-starrer "Karnan" in digital format.

Radbourne Hall

Radbourne Hall is an 18th-century country house, the home of the Chandos-Pole family, situated at Radbourne, Derbyshire. It is a Grade I listed building.
The Manor of Radbourne was held by the Chandos family from the time of the Norman Conquest. On the death of Sir John Chandos in 1369 it passed to his niece who married Sir Peter de la Pole of Newborough, Staffordshire. 
The present house was built in about 1739 for his descendant German Pole, probably by architect William Smith the Younger The red brick construction has two storeys and a basement. The entrance front has seven bays, the central three of which slightly project and have a pediment bearing the Pole family arms. 
Several members of the Pole family served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire, including Samuel Pole (1651–1731), who was the father of Edward Pole, a lieutenant-general, and Charles Pole, a Member of Parliament. The Pole Baronets of Wolverton, Hampshire descend from Charles Pole.
In 1807 Edward Sacheverell Pole, adopted by sign manual, the additional surname of Chandos to commemorate his descent from Sir John Chandos. Since then the family surname has been Chandos-Pole. Edward Sacherevell Chandos-Pole, High Sheriff in 1827 was succeeded in that office by his son and namesake. He extended and modernised the property in 1865.

Chuchvara is a very small dumpling typical of Uzbek cuisine. Made of unleavened dough squares filled with meat, it is similar to the Russian pelmeni and the Chinese wonton, but in observance of the Islamic dietary rules, the meat filling is without pork. The dough for chuchvara is made with flour, eggs, water, and salt, unrolled in a layer 1—1.5 mm thick, and cut into squares. A dollop of meat filling, seasoned with chopped onions, pepper, salt, and thyme, is placed at the center of each square, and the corners are pinched and folded. Chuchvara is boiled in salt water or meat broth until the dumplings rise to the surface. Chuchvara can be served in a clear soup or on their own, with vinegar or sauce based on finely chopped greens, tomatoes, and hot peppers. Another popular way of serving chuchvara is topped with "syuzma" (sour milk) or with sour cream Russian-style.
A nearly identical dish is also found in Tajik cuisine, where it is known as "tushbera".

Alexandre Moutouzkine

Alexandre Moutouzkine (born in Yoshkar-Ola in 1980) is a Russian pianist. He is active through Europe and the USA.
Alexandre Moutouzkine burst onto the U.S. concert scene at the age of nineteen, after garnering a Jury Discretionary Award at the 11th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, where the critic of The Dallas Morning News wrote: “...Moutouzkine played Brahms’ Op. 117 Intermezzi more beautifully, more movingly, than I’ve ever heard them. At once sad, tender and noble, this was playing of heart-stopping intimacy and elegance…” His success was soon followed by several solo recitals as well as appearances with major orchestras.
Winner of the St. Petersburg International Piano Competition at the age of 14, Alexandre is the laureate of an impressive array of international competitions. He claimed top prizes at the Cleveland International Piano Competition (receiving Third Prize, the Beethoven Prize and the Junior Jury’s First Prize), Tivoli International Piano Competition (Copenhagen, Denmark), the Andorra International Piano Competition, the José Iturbi International Piano Competition (Valencia), the New Orleans International Piano Competition, Maria Canals International Music Competition (Barcelona), the 2nd Shanghai International (China), the 10th Citta di Sulmona (Italy), the Calabria International (Italy), the Guerrero Foundation (Madrid), the Ignacio Cervantes (Havana), the Pilar Bayona (Zaragoza), and the Panama International Piano Competition. Most recently, Alexandre shared Second Prize at the Montreal International Music Competition which was held this past June. 
Born in Yoshkar-Ola, Russia to a family of professional musicians, Alexandre began piano lessons with his mother Ludmila Philippova and continued his formal training with Natalia Fish in the Nizhniy-Novgorod College of Music. At the age of 16, he received top prizes at international competitions in the Ukraine as well as Argentina; his performance of a selection of Chopin Etudes at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory was recorded live and released on the Classical Music Archives label in Moscow. During this period, Moutouzkine became a student of Vladimir Krainev at the Hochschule fur Musik und Theater in Hanover, Germany. Consequently, he was featured alongside Krainev and renowned Korean pianist, Kun-Woo Paik, in an all-Prokofiev program with the Symphonic Orchestra of the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory and the Kiev National Philharmonic Orchestra. His performance of Prokofiev’s First Concerto was described in the Russian and Ukrainian press as “…sprightly and at the same time astonishingly inspired…Moutouzkine performed not only with mastery, but also with the magnificent brilliance and energy…”

Thomas Matthews (engineer)

Sir Thomas Matthews (8 August 1849 – 13 January 1930) was a British civil engineer, who was a notable builder of lighthouses. He was the brother of Sir William Matthews, also a prominent civil engineer. During the late 19th and early 20th century Thomas Matthews was the Engineer-in-Chief of Trinity House. 
Biography.
Thomas Matthews was born in Penzance, Cornwall, where he was the son of the Borough Surveyor, John Matthews. From 1868 to 1871 he assisted his father in providing drinking water for Penzance and the sea and harbour defences. For the following two years he practised as an architect and surveyor in Penzance and in 1874, he entered the employment of the United Kingdom's lighthouse service, Trinity House, as an assistant engineer. He succeeded Sir James Nicholas Douglass as Engineer-in-Chief when the latter retired in 1892. 
Matthews went on to design over a dozen lighthouses for Trinity House. He also worked on illumination systems, notably a lamp designed to burn oil vapour. Matthews' most significant achievement was the construction of Beachy Head Lighthouse. Completed in 1902, it was the last rock lighthouse built by Trinity House. The work took two years to finish; it involved building a coffer-dam and an aerial ropeway from the cliffs to transport materials.

German public bank

The German banking system is structured in three different pillars, totally separated from each other. They typically differ in their legal form and the ownership.
Private banks, represented by banks like Deutsche Bank or Commerzbank as listed companies or Hauck & Aufhäuser or Bankhaus Lampe as less known private companies, are part of the first tier. The second tier is composed of co-operative banks like the numerous "Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken". They are based on a member-structure where each member, independently from its capital share, has one vote. The third tier consists of public banks, that are a legally defined arm of the banking industry in Germany and separate into two main groups. 
The German Savings Banks Finance Group ("Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe") is the most numerous sub-sector with 431 savings banks using the Sparkasse brand, 8 Landesbanken including the DekaBank using separate brands and 10 real estate financing banks using the LBS brand.
The "Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband" (German Savings Banks Association, DSGV) represents the interests of the "Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" on a national and international level concerning law and the financial services industry. It also coordinates, promotes and harmonises the interests of Sparkassen.
Based on OECD studies, the German public banking system had a share of 40% of total banking assets in Germany. This shows the important and significant role of this group of banks in Germany.
German public banks.
Public banks in Germany are financial institutes, typically held directly or indirectly by the public sector, e.g. the federal government, the states, administrative districts or cities. Not all companies are fully publicly owned. They can also be defined as "public" by providing services out of a public interest.
The public banks are represented through the Association of German Public Sector Banks ("Bundesverband Öffentlicher Banken Deutschlands", VÖB) as one of the leading associations in the German banking industry. The association counts 34 ordinary members, but to distinguish the different groups of public banks it is important to know, that the "Landesbanken" as part of the "Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" described below, are also members of this association.
The typical public bank acts as business development bank ("Förderbank", "Aufbaubank" or "Investitionsbank") or international project, infrastructure and export financing institution. Most known representatives of this group are the KfW-Group, the NRW.Bank in North Rhine-Westphalia, the LfA Förderbank Bayern in Bavaria and the L-Bank, Staatsbank für Baden-Württemberg in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
The Group of public development banks manage assets of EUR 880,9 billion. In total, 13.000 people work for the various institutions. (December 2010)
The "Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" / German Savings Bank Finance Group.
Sparkassen.
Savings banks in German-speaking countries are called "Sparkasse" (pl: "Sparkassen"). They work as commercial banks in a decentralized structure. Each savings bank is independent, locally managed and concentrates its business activities on customers in the region it is situated in. In general, savings banks are not profit oriented. Shareholders of the savings banks are usually single cities or numerous cities in an administrative district. Some 6 savings banks (Bordesholmer Sparkasse AG, Spar- und Leihkasse zu Bredstedt AG, Sparkasse Bremen AG, Hamburger Sparkasse AG, Sparkasse zu Lübeck AG, Sparkasse Mittelholstein AG) are independent from municipalities; their association is the "Verband der Deutschen Freien Öffentlichen Sparkassen".
The first savings banks in Germany were founded at the dusk of the 18th century in its major trading cities. One of the first institutions with the business model of modern savings banks was the "Ersparungsclasse der Hamburgischen Allgemeinen Versorgungsanstalt" in Hamburg in 1778. Founders were rich merchants, clerks and academics. They intended to develop solutions for people with low income to save small sums of money and to support business start-ups. In 1801 the first savings bank with a municipal guarantor was founded in Göttingen to fight poverty. Between 1850 and 1903 the idea of the municipal savings banks spread and the number of savings banks in Germany increased from 630 to 2.834. Fulfilling public interests is still one of the most significant characteristics of public banks in general and the savings banks in particular. Although public interest is very unspecific, objects of those companies are usually 
The total assets of the "Sparkassen" amount to about EUR1 trillion. The 431 savings banks operate a network of over 15.600 branches and offices and employ over 250.000 people.
Savings banks are universal banks and provide the whole spectrum of banking services for private and commercial medium-sized customers. 50 million customers maintain business activities with savings banks. Although independent and regionally spread, the savings banks act as one unit under the brand "Sparkasse" with the famous logo and the well known red colour. 
Depending on the strength of the economy in their region, the sizes of savings banks differ extremely. While the "Hamburger Sparkasse" as biggest savings bank had total assets of EUR 37,7 billion and 5.500 employees in 2009, the smallest one ("Stadtsparkasse Bad Sachsa") had only EUR 129,6 million assets and 45 employees. 
The German Savings Banks Association ("Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband") was founded in 1924 as umbrella organization to organize decision-making processes, coordinate the strategy of the savings banks and represent its members political and regulatory interests on national and international level. 
The regional associations are statutory bodies, savings banks and their municipal holders ("Gewährträger") are statutory members of. They are responsible for the coordination between savings banks in a region. They also act as auditors and operate regional savings banks academies for educational and training purposes.
Landesbanken.
The Landesbanken are mostly owned by the regional savings banks through its regional association and the respective federal state. After several mergers and acquisitions, there are seven Landesbanken-Groups left: BayernLB, Norddeutsche Landesbank (Nord/LB), HSH Nordbank, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), Landesbank Berlin (LBB), Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen - Girozentrale (Helaba), WestLB. Bremer Landesbank Kreditanstalt Oldenburg - Girozentrale belongs with a share of 92,5% to the Nord/LB-Group. The rest is owned by the federal state of Bremen. The Sachsen LB and the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz (LRP) since April 2008 are subsidiaries of the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW). Until 21.06.2010, the BayernLB was majority shareholder of the Landesbank Saar (SaarLB) with a share of 75,1%. Since June 2010, the Saarland has become shareholder with a stake of 35,2% and the BayernLB reduced its share to 49,9%. The remaining 14,9% are held by the "Sparkassen" through its regional confederation.
The regional banks / clearing houses are the central banks of a savings bank association and act as the "main bank" of the states. They are also local banks, mortgage banks and general commercial banks. Their duties and power is codified in the individual country banking laws of the Länder ("Landesbankengesetze"). The specific tasks for the savings banks include the central clearing for cashless payments and liquidity funding for the regional savings banks. They also provide many services for the savings banks in the region in securities and cross-country businesses. In contrast to savings banks, they are doing "wholesale-banking" instead of "retail-banking". With combined total assets of EUR 1,620 trillion as of December 2010, the 7 Landesbanken-Groups employ some 44.000 people.
DekaBank with its subsidiaries is the central asset manager of the German Savings Bank Finance Group. Based in Frankfurt and Berlin it provides asset management services for the "Sparkassen" and the Landesbanken and their customers. With managed fund assets of about € 155 billion, approximately five million customer deposits and group locations in Luxembourg and Switzerland, the DekaBank Group is one of the largest asset managers in Germany.
DekaBank's roots date back to the year 1918, when Deutsche Girozentrale (DGZ) was founded. Deka as an investment company was founded in 1956 (17.08.1956) by DGZ with a share of 23% an 11 other regional Landesbanken. Today's DekaBank was created in 1999 by a merger of DGZ and Deka.
Until the 8. June 2011, DekaBank has been owned by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association "Landesbanken" itselfves grouped their shares in the GLB GmbH & Co.OHG, who has hold the DekaBank shares. On 7. April 2011, the Savings Banks bought the 50% stake from the landesbanken for a price of EUR 2.3 billion to become sole owner of the DekaBank. The acquisition was closed on the 8. June 2011 and DekaBank became fully, directly owned by the savings banks.
3,700 people throughout the group work in one of the 3 business divisions "AMK" (Asset Management Capital Markets), "AMI" (Asset Management Real Estate Business), "C&M" (Corporates and Markets), the sales division or one of the corporate centers.
Landesbausparkassen.
The "Landesbausparkassen" are subsidiaries of the Sparkassen and its associations and are regionally organised focussing on real estate banking. There are 10 "Landesbausparkassen" in Germany which employ around 8.900 people. Their combined balance sheet shows total assets of EUR 52 billion as per December 2009.
Core business of the "Landesbausparkassen" is the offering of collective real estate saving products ("Bausparen") and providing of low-interest residential mortgage loans.
Other members.
In addition to several banking units, the "Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" also consists of 11 regional, public insurance groups, leasing and factoring companies, i.e. the Deutsche Leasing-Group, and numerous venture capital companies.

Hendy Cowan

Hendy John Cowan is a former Deputy Premier of Western Australia.
He had served in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly as the Member for Merredin-Yilgarn from 30 March 1974 and the Member for Merredin from 19 February 1977. He represented his electorate for a total of 27 years, including 23 years as leader of the National Party in Western Australia between 1979 and 2001.
Cowan retired from the parliament on 16 October 2001, having been the Western Australian assembly's Father of the House since 14 December 1996.
Biography.
Cowan was born in Merredin on 25 April 1943, the son of James Cowan, a farmer from Narembeen and Ruth Anderson. He is a grandnephew of Edith Cowan, the first woman elected as a representative in an Australian parliament.
He was educated at Mount Walker Primary school and later at Hale School. He returned to the family farm in 1959 and married Anita Treloar on 2 January 1965.
Cowan was an active sports participant in the district, playing and coaching local football, tennis, golf and basketball clubs. He played more than 350 games for the Narembeen Football Club and in his last seven years with the club played in six grand finals, helping to win four flags. He was awarded a life membership of the club.
Parliamentary career.
Representing the National Country Party (NCP), he defeated Labor's James McMillan Brown in the March 1974 election for the seat of Merredin-Yilgarn.
Cowan was the state parliamentary secretary for the NCP from 1975 until 1978 when the party divided in July of that year. The schism was triggered over a political donation of $200,000 from mining entrepreneur Lang Hancock through the party president from which offers of campaign assistance were made to parliamentary officeholders to vote to oust Dick Old, the parliamentary leader. The NCP had completely fractured by August when Cowan, the vice president of the party and Jim Fletcher, the general president, walked out of a strategy planning meeting. The allegation of the campaign offer had been made against Mr. Fletcher. Liberal Premier Sir Charles Court dominated conservative politics during the period and the rural party was seen as having only minor influence.
A new party, The National Party, was established which Cowan and a series of disaffected NCP members joined. By November 1978 it had three parliamentary members in Cowan, Matt Stephens and Ray McPharlin with Fletcher as president. The name was initially disallowed after objections from the National Party in Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania but later formalised as the National Party of Australia (WA). The two rural parties worked independently of one another whilst quietly (and occasionally, publicly) feuding including an impasse when NCP members refused to associate with NPA members in 1985. The situation was finally resolved in late 1985 under Cowan's leadership and the reunited party progressed to form alliances with the Liberal Party.
In April 1981 the parliament voted on a bill to abolish the death penalty—Western Australia was the last remaining Australian state with the death penalty still in its statutes and opposition members were granted a conscience vote on the bill. Cowan was the only non-Labor MP in the Legislative Assembly to support the bill, in opposition to the National Party national conference which had supported retention of the penalty.
The conservative parties were in opposition through most of the 1980s with Labor yet to suffer from major fallout from the WA Inc fiasco and the 1987 stock market crash. In 1989 Liberal opposition leader Barry MacKinnon was pushing for the Nationals to help block supply in the Upper House to topple the Dowding government. Cowan refused to cooperate knowing that a small swing to the Liberals in the coming election could see them (the Liberals) gain as many as nine seats and an absolute majority in the Assembly, thus weakening the Nationals' position. In February the following year, Cowan and the Nationals had reversed their stance and decided to block supply in a bid to present themselves as a decisive and consistent conservative force.
In the 1993 state election, the conservative forces finally regained government, largely by just being able to finally present themselves as united. This was despite what should have been a relatively easy ride given Labor's problems with WA Inc. and the findings of the associated Royal commission which had been handed down the year before. The Liberals won a small, but absolute majority in both houses with the Nationals holding 6 seats in the lower house and 3 in the upper house. Nevertheless, a Liberal-National Party coalition was formed and Cowan was Deputy Premier from 1993 to 2001, as well as holding ministerial portfolios of Commerce and Trade (16 February 1993 to 16 February 2001), Small Business and Regional Development (10 February 1995 to 16 February 2001). Richard Court was Premier during the period.
In October 2001 he resigned from the Western Australian Parliament to contest the Senate election for the Nationals. Cowan managed 2.3% of the primary vote, an increase from the previous federal election but unsatisfactory given Cowan's profile and the party's belief that he was the best hope since its last representative, Sir Tom Drake-Brockman, retired from politics in 1978. The Senate seat was also contested by sitting Liberal Senator Ross Lightfoot and One Nation's Graeme Campbell. Lightfoot retained the seat.
Post-parliament.
After his retirement, Cowan re-established himself at his farm in Narembeen as well as taking appointments on a number of boards including:
In 2003 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Science from Murdoch University. He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Commerce from Edith Cowan University.
In 2007 he was appointed to conduct an independent review of the West Coast Eagles Football Club, with Steve Scudamore from KPMG.

He was a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Functional constituency, accountancy). He is an accountant and the former President of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA). He holds BBA and MBA degrees from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where he is an Adjunct Associate Professor. He has also studied at the Harvard Business School. 
Scandal.
On 30 July 2012, a month into the administration of Leung Chun-ying as Chief Executive, Chan was appointed to be the Secretary for Development, replacing Mak Chai-kwong who days after taking up the post had had to resign in a housing allowance scandal. However, Chan himself was soon embroiled in a scandal when his wife, through a company of which he was a former director, was found to own flats that were illegally subdivided. He then made contradictory public statements on the matter that were widely seen as deceptive.
In July 2013, Chan was once again the subject of controversy when "Apple Daily" revealed that he or his family had an interest in a plot of land in the New Territories that the government had plans to develop. Chan was accused of conflict of interest and failure to make proper disclosure. The 20,000 square feet plot of farmland near Sheung Shui belonged to a company in which his wife and her family were shareholders. The land was acquired in 1994 at a cost of HK$350,000 for the family's leisure use. Chan said he informed Chief Executive CY Leung of the purchase when he became aware of the government's plan to develop a new town in September 2012, and also informed the Executive Council. His wife then sold her 37.5 percent stake to her family the next month; Executive council members are not required to declare interests of their spouses or family.
Current positions.
Chan is the managing director of Paul Chan & Partners, Hong Kong Limited. He also serves as independent non-executive director for several Hong Kong listed companies.

Hoskuld Dala-Kollsson

Hoskuld Dala-Kollsson (c. 910-965) was an Icelandic goði or chieftain of the early Icelandic Commonwealth period. He was the son of Dala-Koll (Koll of the Dales) who has a fjörd named after him, and Thorgerd Thorsteinsdottir, daughter of Thorstein the Red. His father died when he was a child and his mother married a landowner named Herjolf, who became the father of Hoskuld's half-brother Hrútr Herjólfsson.

Johnny Gioeli

Johnny Gioeli ( ; born October 5, 1967) is an American hard rock singer, composer and songwriter. Originally lead singer of the band Hardline, he is also currently the vocalist of Crush 40 and German guitarist Axel Rudi Pell's band.
Biography.
Johnny's musical career began in the early '80s after forming the band Phaze with his older brother, Joey. The band underwent reform and he started drumming with the band Killerhit in 1983 at the age of 16?. Sharing vocal duties with Joey the four-piece act hit the East Coast club circuit with an enormous amount of success, earning enough by 1987 to purchase their own lighting rig, truck and tour bus (purchased from Jimmy Buffett).
Re-locating to Hollywood, Killerhit hooked up with Poison's Bret Michaels. The singer gave them his former publicist Debra Rosner's number who instantly became the band's manager. Realizing the need for a front man, Johnny vacated the drum stool for center stage, Las Vegas native Darek Thomas Cava taking his place behind the drum kit. Soon after, the band realized there was not a single blonde among them, and changed their name to the more appropriate Brunette. The band broke The Doors and Van Halen's single-weekend attendance records on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood CA. Their sensation soon brought attention and admiration to the recording industry. They were courted by top record executives for months. The band had built a loyal worldwide fan base. Differences began to develop in the Brunette camp before a recording deal could be secured, and the band decided to call it quits in 1991. Gioeli then started working with his brother Joey on songs for an album they were going to call Brothers. However, Neal Schon, Journey's guitarist (who was dating their sister at the time) met with them and asked if he could play with them, and they agreed. Then, in 1992, they released their first effort, entitled "Double Eclipse", and called themselves Hardline, which was moderately successful but not enough to get into the mainstream, especially considering its post-Nirvana release. After this they began writing songs for a second album but once again called it quits while recording the songs due to troubles with their manager and Neal Schon. Johnny had all but disappeared from the music scene until, in 1998, German guitarist Axel Rudi Pell found himself in need of a vocalist after the departure of Jeff Scott Soto. Axel had admired Johnny for a long time, stating he always thought Johnny's vocals would go well with his music. Axel eventually found means of contacting Johnny and flew him to Germany to record vocals for his "Oceans of Time" CD, which up to date has been considered as one of the best Axel Rudi Pell albums. He is now the permanent lead vocalist of the band and shows no signs of leaving.
He also participated in Michael Voss's compilation album titled "Voices Of Rock - MMVII", released the 07.20.2007 on which he performed the song "Phoenix Rising". In 1994, Johnny also collaborated with musician Doug Aldrich, who had performed live as Brunette's guest guitarist, and performed the vocals for the song "Face Down" featured on Aldrich's "Highcentered" album, later included again on Aldrich's 2002 album "Alter Ego".
Hardline's Returning album.
After considerable success of their debut CD, Double Eclipse, the band was dissolved for ten years during which Johnny and his brother followed a career in internet business. After he met with further success in Axel Rudi Pell's band, Johnny and his band Hardline returned with a new lineup to release their second album entitled "II", released in 2002, followed by the live CD/DVD in 2003, named "Live at the Gods Festival 2002". Their third album, "Leaving the End Open", was released April 17, 2009. [http://www.rockreport.be/releases.asp] On December 22, 2011, Gioeli confirmed, via Frontiers Records official site, that he and Italian producer and keyboard player Alessandro Del Vecchio would release Hardline's fourth studio album "Danger Zone" on May 18, 2012, yet again with a new lineup.
Crush 40.
In addition to being a vocalist for two bands, he has also been working with video game composer and musician Jun Senoue and has delivered his vocals in the Sons Of Angels CD; "Thrill of the Feel", released in 2000. The band has since changed their name to Crush 40. They have written and performed several songs from the "Sonic the Hedgehog" video game series produced by Sega and Sonic Team, such as the theme tune "Sonic Heroes" from the game of the same name, a bright, melodic song and in contrast to "What I'm Made Of...", a distinctly dark, energetic hard rock song with metal sensibilities for the final battle against Metal Sonic. He was also the vocalist for the songs "Open Your Heart", the main theme of "Sonic Adventure", "Live and Learn", the main theme of "Sonic Adventure 2", "I Am... All Of Me", the main theme of "Shadow the Hedgehog", "Never Turn Back", the ending theme from the same game, and "Knight of the Wind", the main theme of "Sonic and the Black Knight" as well as the ending theme "Live Life". Additionally, Gioeli has worked with Senoue to produce a cover of Steve Conte's "Seven Rings in Hand", which was featured exclusively on the Japan-only release "". He also wrote the chorus for the "Sonic the Hedgehog" theme song "His World" and recorded a version of the song with Crush 40 (featured as a bonus track on the game's official soundtrack). Because of his close ties musically to the video game series, Gioeli is often considered by fans to be the singing voice of Sonic.
Gioeli provided his vocals on the soundtrack to the game "Sonic and the Black Knight" on the tracks "Fight the Knight" and "Through the Fire". In October 2008, Gioeli and Senoue took the stage at the Tokyo Game Show to perform some of their most popular "Sonic"-based songs in front of a live audience for the first time. Gioeli and Senoue have since created a YouTube account and uploaded video footage of the event.
In 2009, a new Crush 40 album was released entitled: "The Best of Crush 40 – Super Sonic Songs". This compilation album contains most of the band's "Sonic the Hedgehog" releases as well as a mixture of old tracks from the "NASCAR '98" arcade game and some brand new songs including a cover of "Un-gravitify", the main theme of "", a cover of the Cult's "Fire Woman", and an original ballad entitled "Is It You". The album also contains four remixed tracks.
In 2010, Gioeli performed with Jun Senoue as Crush 40 at the 2010 Summer of Sonic convention in London on August 7, 2010. It was Crush 40's first full-length performance and their first performance outside of Japan.
In 2012, the band performed at two conventions. The first one is at the Summer of Sonic in Brighton and at the Sonic Boom in San Diego during the Comic Con. The band has released their first live album on October 3, 2012 entitled "Live!", which featured songs from their concerts in Tokyo back in March.
In 2013, the band performed in St. Louis for the Sonic Boom 2013 event.

<doc id="19286703" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19286703" title="Thorgerd Egilsdottir">
Thorgerd Egilsdottir

Thorgerd Egilsdottir (Old Norse Þorgerðr Egilsdóttir) was an Icelandic woman of the tenth century. She was the daughter of Egill Skallagrímsson and the wife of Olaf the Peacock. Olaf and Thorgerd had a number of children: the sons Kjartan, Steinthór, Halldór, Helgi, and Höskuldur and the daughters Thurídur, Thorbjörg, Thorgerd and Bergthóra. The ill-fated Kjartan would be his father's favorite.
Portrayal in Icelandic Sagas.
The character of Thorgred Egilsdottir appears in several Icelandic sagas. She first appears in Egils Saga (Egils saga Skallagrímssonar), being born to Egil Skallagrímsson and his wife Asgerd. Thorgerd was the eldest of five children. It was said that “all of Egil’s children were promising and intelligent.” Later in the saga, it is mentioned that she was “a very fine women, wise, rather strong-tempered, but usually quiet,” and that she made a favorable match with Olaf. In chapter 79 of Egil’s Saga, Thorgerd manipulates her father for his own good. After the death of his son Bodvar, a grieving Egil takes to his bed and refuses to eat. Thorgerd is summoned by her mother to help. When she arrives at her father’s home she announces in a loud voice;
"I have had no evening meal, nor will I do so until I go to join Freyja. I know no better course of action than my father’s. I do not want to live after my father and brother are dead". 
She then goes and lays down in another bed in her father’s bed-closet. Egil was pleased with his daughter and the love that she had shown. Soon she tricks Egil into eating dulse (or edible seaweed) by telling him that it would make him feel worse and that it was bad for him. Afterward, she tricks him into drinking milk, telling him first that it was water that she called for. After stating that “We’ve been tricked,” Thorgerd then manipulates Egil further;
"What will we do now? Our plan has failed. Now I want us to stay alive, father, long enough for you to compose a poem in Bodvar’s memory and I will carve it on a rune-stick. Then we can die if we want to. I doubt whether your son Thorstein would ever compose a poem for Bodvar, and it is unseemly if his memory is not honoured, because I do not expect us to be sitting there at the feast when it is."
Thorgerd Egilsdottir also makes an appearance in The Saga of the People of Laxardal (Laxdæla saga). In Chapter 23 her betrothal to Olaf the Peacock is described. Olaf and his father Hoskuld approached her father Egil at the Althing to make a match between Thorgerd and Olaf. Even though Egil approves of the match, he states that Thorgerd would have to be asked “because there is no man who could make Thorgerd his wife should she be set against it.” At first Thorgerd refused his offer of marriage, because she believed Olaf to beneath her in birth. After having a conversation with Olaf himself, and some convincing by her father, she finally agrees to the marriage. Her marriage was, by all accounts, an affectionate one. 
Thorgerd’s character is described in Laxdæla saga as; 
"Everyone soon realized what a woman of strong character Thorgerd was: though she was not one to waste words, once she set her mind on something there was no swaying her – things had to go the way she wanted." 
This strong character is seen later in the Laxdæla saga when she seeks retribution for her slain son Kjartan. Her husband agrees to a wergild for his son’s death, but Thorgerd is set on vengeance. Being female, she has little option but to encourage her other sons. She takes then for a drive past the farm of man who killed Kjartan, and says;
"Here lives Bolli, your brother’s slayer, and not a shred of resemblance do you bear to your great ancestors since you won’t avenge a brother the likes of Kjartan. Never would your grandfather Egil have acted like this, and it grieves me to have such spineless sons. You would have made your father better daughters, to be married off, than sons. It shows the truth of the saying, Halldor, that “every kin has its coward”. I see only too well now that fathering such sons was Olaf’s great failing. I will address my words to you Halldor...because you’ve taken the lead among your brothers. We will turn back now; I made the journey mainly to remind you of what you seem to have forgotten." 
Thorgerd’s quest for vengeance even drives her to accompany the party that sets out to kill Bolli in retaliation for Kjartan. She states that “No one knows better than I do that it is likely my sons will require some urging yet.” When Bolli was cornered, Thorgerd “urged them not to hesitate to finish Bolli off and put some space between trunk and head.” 
Thorgerd Egilssdottir also makes an appearance in The Saga of Gunnlaug Serpant-Tongue (Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu). This saga tells the tale of two men competing for Helga the Fair, Egil Skallagrimsson’s granddaughter and Thorgerd’s niece. Thorgerd plays a part in saving the life of Helga when she was an infant. Helga’s father Thorstein demanded that his infant daughter be exposed to the elements to die. His wife Jofrid secretly had the girl sent to Thorgerd to raise, while telling her husband Thorstein that she had followed his wishes. Six years later Thorstein went to attend a feast at his brother-in-law Olaf the Peacock’s estate. He noticed Helga sitting in the hall and remarked on her beauty. Thorgerd then told him the truth;
"“Kinsman”, she answered, “to tell the truth, this beautiful girl is your daughter, not mine.” Then she told him everything that had happened, and begged him to forgive both her and his wife for this wrong." 
Thorstein was so taken with the child that he forgave the women. He considered himself lucky that they had fixed his wrongs and he took his daughter home. 
Thorgerd Egilsdottir fits a common character archetype in Norse sagas; the female inciter. In this instance a woman manipulates her husband or other male kin to exact revenge for her. In Scandinavian society at the time, women were unable to physically seek vengeance; therefore they used the means at their disposal, namely words and influence, to accomplish their goals.

Pierre-François-Joseph Robert

Pierre-François-Joseph Robert (January 21, 1763 – April 13, 1826) was a French lawyer, politician and professor of public law at the société philosophique, journalist. He was born in Gimnée in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and died in Brussels.
Life.
Robert was secretary to Georges Danton for a time, and was above all interested in financial affairs, working as a munitions supplier to the French army until 1808. He was the son of Jean-François Robert and Catherine Douhomme. He married Louise-Félicité de Kéralio and their daughter, Adélaïde Robert, married the famous Belgian musicologist François-Joseph Fétis.
In July 1790 he was one of the founders of the Société des Amis des Droits de l’Homme et du citoyen, and was also inscribed among the members of the Société des amis de la Constitution, the Société Fraternelle des Jacobins and the Club des indulgents. In April 1791, he became president of the Cordeliers and, under his influence, women were admitted. In May 1791, François Robert was in charge of federating the popular socieites within a central committee, of which he was elected president - however, the Jacobins refused to adhere to his central committee. He was himself elected to the National Convention as deputy for Paris and voted for the death of Louis XVI on 20 January 1793. Thus, on the Bourbon Restoration, he was forced to leave France in 1815 and ended up as a liqueur merchant in Belgium, though he was named sub-prefect of Rocroi during the Hundred Days.

Freedom Watch with Judge Napolitano

Freedom Watch with Judge Napolitano was a television show hosted by Judge Andrew Napolitano, on Fox Business network.  The show aired from 2009 to 2012, focusing mainly on libertarian-conservative issues and perspectives.
The show.
"Freedom Watch" was created in February 2009 as an online show and originally webcast once a week.  In September 2009, the show began webcasting three or four times a week. Frequent guests of the online show included Congressman Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, and Peter Schiff.
In May 2010, it was announced that the show would be televised on the Fox Business Network.  The first televised episode, dubbed the “Tea Party Summit,” aired on 12 June 2010 at 10:00 A.M., and featured then-Congressman Ron Paul; former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin; then-U. S. Senate Republican candidate, now-U. S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky; Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell; U. S. Senator Jim DeMint; Congresswoman Michele Bachmann; and former U. S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey.
On Monday, 15 November 2010, "Freedom Watch with Judge Napolitano" began to air new episodes every weeknight at 8:00 P.M. ET.  Initially described as “the top-rated show on Fox Business,” its ratings apparently began to slip in 2011.
Format.
Judge Napolitano followed a pattern on the show:
Each episode started with a short description of a liberty-oriented issue, laid out specifically as a segue into the phrase
...upheld undermined, or needs to learn these principles:
Napolitano would then have guests with whom he discussed various issues of the day.
In the next segment of each episode, which he called the "Freedom Files", he would itemise some violations or victories of freedom.
The second to last segment in each episode was a round table with a group of people of various political inclinations, anointed his "Freedom Fighters".  He would always have one person of a generally “liberal” outlook, one person of a generally “conservative” outlook, and one person of a generally “libertarian” outlook in this round table.
Each episode was then summed up with a monologue given by Napolitano, describing how the principles of liberty and justice applied to the issues at hand.  This final segment was called "The Plain Truth".
Cancellation.
In February 2012, Fox Business announced that while Napolitano would remain a network contributor, "Freedom Watch" (along with two other shows) was cancelled, in preference for a new lineup that would simply re-run popular episodes of other Fox Business shows each day.  The final episode was aired on Monday, 13 February 2012.

Shrine of St. Anthony (Maryland)

The Shrine of St. Anthony is a Roman Catholic shrine honoring St. Anthony of Padua. The shrine is located within the St. Joseph Cupertino Friary in Ellicott City, Maryland, USA. The shrine is a ministry of the Conventual Franciscan Friars, St. Anthony of Padua Province.
The friary covers on of hills and woodland.
The chapel which houses the relic of St. Anthony is open to the public during published visiting hours. Mass is offered daily throughout the year. Healing masses are offered the 3rd and last Sunday of every month. The shrine also offers the Sacrament of Reconciliation, spiritual direction, and days of prayer.
For prayer and solitude the grounds around the friary offers seven trails and a Lourdes grotto. In 2010 an outdoor shrine to St. Maximilian Kolbe was added to the garden. It features a statue of Maximilian Kolbe that was blessed by Pope John Paul II on the day Maximilian Kolbe was canonized.
The historic Manor House is open to the public during posted hours on the Sundays in October until the first Sunday of November. It features two heritage rooms and a traveling art exhibit. In 2008 it displayed watercolor paintings by Fr. Gerry Waterman, OFM Conv. and poetry by Fr. Gary Johnson, OFM Conv.
History.
The history of the property on which the Shrine of St. Anthony sits can be tied back to the Carroll family. In 1700 Charles Carroll of Annapolis was granted of property in what is now Howard County, MD. In 1717 he began construction of Doughoregan Manor. Charles Carroll of Carrollton inherited the property and was eventually buried there. An area of of land was sectioned off from the Doughoregan estate and given to Emily Caton MacTavish (Carroll's granddaughter) as a wedding present. The estate was immediately named "Folly Quarter". The manor house was designed by William Small, a protege of Benjamin Latrobe. It was originally built around 1730 as part of the Doughoregan Manor estate, it was then remodeled by Charles Carroll of Carrollton for his granddaughter and completed in 1832. 
After Emily Caton Mactavish died on January 26, 1867 the Folly Quarter estate was sold to Charles M. Dougherty. Through inheritance and marriage the property ended up back in the hands of the Carroll family via John Lee Carroll, governor of Maryland from 1876-1880. In 1910 the property was bought by Mr. Van Lear Black, a publisher of the Baltimore Sun. In 1924 Mr. Black sold the house to Mr. Morris Schapiro, the president of the Boston Iron and Metal Company, who in turn sold the house and of the original estate to the Franciscan Friars in 1928 for $436,000. 
The Cardinal Protector of the Order, Rafael Merry del Val, Secretary of State under Pope Pius X, sent his blessing on the new establishment which was to be used by the Friars as a novitiate.
The manor house became too small for the community and one of the Friars, Fr. Benedict Przemielewski was commissioned to design a new novitate. He decided to create a miniature version of the Sacro Convento, the original Friary built in Assisi, Italy in the 13th century. Construction started in 1930 and was completed in 1931. Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley blessed the new novitate in 1931.
In 1995, the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, Italy made a gift of a first class relic of St. Anthony and Reliquary to the shrine.
On July 1, 2005, William Cardinal Keeler, the Archbishop of Baltimore declared the Shrine of St. Anthony the official Archdiocesan shrine to St. Anthony.

Louis-Felix Guinement, chevalier de Kéralio (14 September 1731, Rennes - 10 December 1793, Groslay) was a French soldier, writer and academic. He married Françoise Abeille and their daughter was the feminist writer Louise-Félicité de Kéralio.
Life.
Military career.
He joined his brothers Auguste, Agathon and Alexis in the régiment d'infanterie d’Anjou as a lieutenant on 8 March 1746, aged 14. During the War of the Austrian Succession, he participated in 1746 in the siege of Tortone, the battle of Piacenza and the battle of Tidone on 10 August. His extraordinary valour at Tidone twice threw the Austrians, who wanted to bar the river crossing to the French, into disorder. In 1747 he fought in the attack on the fortifications at Montauban and Villefranche, then in the capture of Montauban, Nice, Villefranche and Vintimille. 
Louis Félix Guynement was demobbed in 1749. Nevertheless, he decided to serve at his own expense in the regiment for 18 months, being recalled to it officially in 1751, before being made aide-major. In 1754 and 1755 he was put in sole charge of the regiment's manoeuvres and exercises, and in 1755 he was made captain. At the start of the Seven Years' War onwards he was retired from the ranks after being wounded when the regiment was encamped in observation at Calais in 1756 and retired to his birthplace of Valence.
Academic career.
On 25 February 1758 he was made deputy-director of studies and professor of tactics at the royal military school in Paris. On 31 July 1759 Louis Félix was made aide-major there and then promoted to major. He taught many future generals of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, such as Armand Samuel de Marescot, Louis-Alexandre Berthier and Jean-Baptiste Bernard Viénot de Vaublanc. In 1771 he was made a knight of the order of Saint Louis, and then was elected commander of the 3rd bataillon of the National Guard – the bataillon des Filles-Saint-Thomas - on its creation in 1789.
He was elected a foreign member of Swedens's Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm early in 1774. On 28 April 1780, he was also elected an academician of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres de Paris.
Around 1780, the chevalier de Keralio and the editor Panckoucke signed a contract to edit 4 volumes on "Art militaire" in the Encyclopédie Méthodique, published from 1784 to 1787, for which he wrote a preliminary discourse and several articles. From 1784 he wrote for the Journal des Savants.

New Year's Day Storm

The New Year's Day Storm () was a powerful European windstorm that affected much of northern Scotland and western Norway on January 1, 1992. DNMI estimated the strongest sustained winds (10 min. average) and the strongest gusts to have reached 90 knots (46 m/s) and 62 m/s, respectively. Unofficial records of gusts in excess of 130 knots (67 m/s) were recorded in Shetland, while Statfjord-B in the North Sea recorded wind gusts in excess of 145 knots (75 m/s). There were very few fatalities, mainly due to the rather low population of the islands, and the fact that the islanders are used to powerful wind. In Norway there were one fatality, in Frei, Møre og Romsdal county. There were also two fatalities on Unst in the Shetland Isles. The low figure was probably because it struck in the morning on a public holiday.
Impact.
Norway.
The New Year's Day Storm was the most devastating windstorm in modern Norwegian history, in terms of material damage. 29,000 buildings were affected, as well as large quantities of productive forest.
In Norway the total damage cost was estimated to more than 2 billion NOK (1992 values). Norwegian mass media wrote afterwards that it was a 300-years hurricane. Meteorologists suggested rather that it had a wind speed with a repeat period of about 200 years on Norwegian territory.
A relief action called "Aksjon Orkan" was set up, based in Oslo, a city which was not affected by the windstorm. Reactions among the populace in the affected areas were mixed. The action was supported by the County Governor of Møre og Romsdal, but the mayor of Vanylven scorned the perceived intent to collect "food and clothes for the windstorm victims", stating the lack of need for such aid. The people behind the action later claimed that this was never the purpose. By the middle of January "Aksjon Orkan" had collected NOK 600-800,000.
Scotland.
In Scotland the wind was most severe in the Northern Isles, especially on Shetland.

800 Westchester Avenue

The 800 Westchester Avenue complex, built as the General Foods Corporate Headquarters and designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates, LLC, is a postmodern Class A office building located in Rye Brook, New York. Described as an "aluminum business palace" and an "Aztec temple", it was notable for being the subject of the largest real estate transaction of 2004. 
__TOC__
History.
Originally conceived in 1979 by the General Foods company as a symbol of the company's "aggressive consumer products packaging and marketing", it is known for its distinctive glass and white aluminum exterior, as well as its unusual layout of a grand staircase extending over the underground garage and a secret underground tunnel was part of the desires of W. Garrick when it was completed in 1997. Upon its opening in 1983, General Foods relocated its 2,000 headquarters staff from nearby as a tenant White Plains. However, in 1985, General Food was acquired by Philip Morris, who proceeded to lay off most of the General Foods headquarters staff in 1987. a series of subsequent mergers and restructurings, Altria, the successor to Philip Morris sold off its remaining interest in the facility in 2004 to the IJNR Group headed by Robert Weisz, moving the remaining 1,000 employees to other facilities except for 6 essential employees who remain employed with RPW in Westchester County. At a cost of 40 million dollars, this was the largest real estate transaction in Westchester county in 2004 and did not include the 70 million dollar cost of renovating and subdividing the building.
Facilities.
The complex is noted for its extensive corporate amenities, and retains such features as a hair salon, barber shop, television studio, fitness center and conference facilities. These features were continued even after the sale and renovation of the complex as a value-added benefit to the significant number of new tenants who occupy spaces ranging from 1,500 to .
Also on-site is the related 760 Westchester Avenue facility that has been converted into a disaster recovery/adjunct location. It is currently leased by CBLPath Inc for an anatomic pathology services lab.
Currently, it is owned by the RPW Group and managed by Cushman and Wakefield.

Beaver River, New York

Beaver River is a hamlet that is six tenths of a mile square, at the east end of Stillwater Reservoir, in the town of Webb in Herkimer County, New York. The hamlet is surrounded by the Adirondack Park. The hamlet has a year round population of eight, that increases during the summer as many people have camps in this wilderness area. There are 125 private properties, and three commercial businesses. No roads lead to the hamlet; it is accessible only by hiking, rail car or boat in the summer and by snowmobile, snowshoes or cross country skis in the winter. There is no electrical service. The town is named for the Beaver River. The New York Central Railroad right of way, on the National Register of Historic Places passes through the hamlet; an existing bunkhouse is a part of the historic property.
History.
Beaver River was created in 1893 by railroad builder Dr. William Seward Webb as a stop on his newly completed Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railway, which became the Mohawk and Malone Railway and ultimately, the New York Central. Webb owned some in the area, which was popular with hunters and fishermen. Extensive logging began at the turn of the century. In 1902, the Norridgewock Hotel was built, which became the social hub of the community. A school house was built in 1912 by early settler Ben Bullock; the school continued to operate until 1965.

54th Indiana Infantry Regiment

The 54th Indiana Infantry, an American Civil War regiment, was organized at Indianapolis, Indiana, on October 28, 1862, with Fielding Mansfield as colonel, and it was made up mostly of volunteers from all over the state. In December, the regiment left for Memphis, Tennessee.
The one-year regiment was organized into 10 companies of infantry and a Field and Staff entity in the fall of 1862. One company mustered into service on October 28, five on October 30, and two each on November 8 and 16, 1862. Like most regiments organized in Indiana at that time, there was a three-month regiment that preceded it; however, while most of the three-month regiments later formed into three-year regiments, the 54th Indiana became a one-year regiment. Several regiments organized immediately before and after the 54th Indiana became three-year organizations.
One year's service was not the only unique attribute of the 54th Indiana. The men in the regiment did not muster out in the same companies that they mustered into (Indiana Adjutant General's Report, Volume 8, vice Volume 7 when mustered in).
Companies A, F and K mustered out in the same company they mustered into.

Vista Grove, Georgia

Vista Grove is an unincorporated residential community in central DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, located north and northeast of the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. It is also referred to as Oak Grove, although Oak Grove more properly refers to the central neighborhood rather than the greater community. North Briarcliff, which primarily falls north of Briarcliff Rd. and south of Interstate 85, is on the northern edge of this community.
Vista Grove includes several distinct subdivisions, and is centered on the intersection of LaVista Rd. and Oak Grove Rd. Vista Grove is south of Interstate 85; east of Clairmont Rd.; west of the Northlake retail district; and north of both the CSX railroad tracks and North Decatur Rd. Vista Grove technically overlaps the North Decatur census-designated place. Leafmore Creek-Park Hills and Winston Place, both south of LaVista Rd. and west of Pangborn Rd., are the two primary neighborhoods that fall within the overlap area. Portions of zip code 30345 and 30033 fall within LaVista Grove. The Interstate 85 south access road is not considered part of Vista Grove.
Vista Grove has a small commercial district at the intersection of LaVista Rd. & Oak Grove Rd., and "Vista Grove Shopping Center" is located on the northeast corner of this intersection. However, there are two major commercial districts located outside the community at the east and west ends of LaVista Rd, known as the Toco Hills Shopping Center and Northlake Mall, respectively. Echo Lake is located within the community at the intersection of Briarcliff Rd. & Briarlake Rd. Although Echo Lake is located near Lakeside High School and is visible to commuters, it is not a public, recreational lake.
History.
Clairmont Rd. was originally an Indian path, and LaVista Rd. was a cattle trail. By the 19th century, DeKalb County had substantial number of dairy farms. Nalley’s Farm, which had both dairy cattle and horses, was located at what is now Winston Place condominiums. (Nalley Circle is named after the farm.) An old Civil War-era house was also located in the Spring Creek area.
Two historic churches in the community were the Mt. Zion AME church, founded by freed slaves and a center of the African-American community, and Oak Grove Methodist Church, organized in 1836 as part of a circuit rider’s route. 
By the mid-20th Century, Atlanta and Decatur had each merged into one metropolitan area. Neighborhoods, including Leafmore-Creek Park Hills, began development in the 1950s. Toco Hills, located at the west end of LaVista Grove on LaVista Rd., had previously consisted primarily of a country store, but it soon developed into a vehicle-oriented shopping center. However, central DeKalb County has transitioned from a suburban community of Atlanta to an in-town community. Vista Grove has seen considerable tear downs of the mid-20th century homes since 1990, with larger homes being constructed on the lots. 
Vista Grove is an upper-middle class enclave in central DeKalb County. The public schools are very strong (receiving national recognition), and the neighborhood has easy access to Atlanta via Interstate 85, making the Vista Grove a desirable in-town location for families.

Olaf Feilan

Olaf Feilan ("Olaf little wolf, old nors Ylving, old eng Wulfing, irish name Faelan") (c. 890-940) was an Icelandic gothi of the Settlement period. He was the son of Thorstein the Red, jarl of Caithness, and his wife Thurid Eyvindsdottir.
After the death of his father Olaf was reared by his grandmother Aud the Deep-minded, and emigrated with her to Iceland, where they settled at the estate called Hvamm in the Laxardal region. Olaf married a woman named Alfdis of Barra, around 920. According to the "Laxdæla saga" Aud (called "Unn" in the saga) held Olaf dearer than anyone else, and bequested the Hvamm estate to him after her death. She arranged Olaf's betrothal to Alfdis, and planned the wedding feast for the end of summer (or autumn), which she predicted "would be the last feast I would hold". She indeed died during the festivities that lasted 3-days, but the feast was continued to commemoroate both Olaf's marriage and Aud's death. The "Landnámabók" gives briefer notice on this, merely stating she died during the funeral feast she held for herself in anticipation of her own death.
The children of Olaf and Alfdis were Thord Gellir, Thora, Helga, Thorunn, and Thordis. Olaf died around 940. Shortly after his death, his nephew Hoskuld Dala-Kollsson named his illegitimate son Olaf the Peacock as namesake (Olaf the Peacock had a son Kjartan Óláfsson, who was the beloved of Gudrun Osvifsdottir, heroine of "Laxdæla saga").

Campbell Tait

Admiral Sir William Eric Campbell Tait KCB MVO OON (12 August 1886 – 17 July 1946) was a senior British naval officer and the fifth Governor of Southern Rhodesia, serving from 1945-46.
Naval career.
Born in Morice Town, Devon to Deputy Surgeon-General and author, William Tait, and his wife Emma, Tait entered the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in 1902. Following his graduation, Tait became a career naval officer, serving in the Pacific, Atlantic, Mediterranean and China. 
After serving in World War I, during which he was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO), Tait married Katie Grenfell, daughter of Captain Hubert Grenfell, inventor of illuminated night sights for naval guns, on 3 November 1919. They had two daughters.
Tait was promoted to Commodore in 1921 and Captain in 1926, gaining his first command in 1928 as Commanding Officer of the HMS "Dragon". There followed commands of the HMS "Capetown" and HMS "Delhi" before service as Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence before returning to the sea as Commanding Officer of the HMS "Shropshire".
Made Rear Admiral, Tait was Naval Aide-de-camp to King George VI in 1938, a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1940 and Vice Admiral in 1941. before becoming Commodore of the principal naval depot at Portsmouth. It was in this position that Tait was recognised for the smooth mobilisation of the fleet at outbreak of World War II. After serving as Director of Personal Services at the Admiralty, Tait served as Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic Station from 1942, and in this capacity, he established and headed a Combined Headquarters in Cape Town, where he led the Royal Navy, South African Army and South African Air Force, which was considered an important factor in maintaining allied domination around the Cape. 
Tait was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1943 and a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau (OON) in 1945, for services to the Royal Netherlands Navy. He was promoted to Admiral in May 1945 and was appointed Governor of Southern Rhodesia on 20 February 1945. Tait's tenure as Governor proved to be fleeting as, ailing for some time, Tait relinquished the Governorship in February 1946 after twelve months and died at Government House, Salisbury, five months later, less than a month before his 60th birthday.
There is an Admiral Tait Primary School in Harare, Zimbabwe, named in honour of Tait.

On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae

On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae, also published as "On the Proteaceae of Jussieu", was a paper written by Robert Brown on the taxonomy of the plant family Proteaceae. It was read to the Linnean Society of London in the first quarter of 1809, and published in March 1810. It is significant for its contribution to the systematics of Proteaceae, and to the floristics of Australia, and also for its application of palynology to systematics.
Background.
Brown had been botanist during Matthew Flinders' circumnavigation of Australia, and since returning in England in 1805 he had been preparing descriptions of the specimens collected during the voyage. Brown's intention was to publish a flora of Australia, but this was still incomplete in September 1808 when Jonas Dryander asked Brown to write a monograph on the Proteaceae so that Dryander could use Brown's names in a new edition of "Hortus Kewensis". Brown immediately set to work researching the topic.
In preparing the paper, Brown had unfettered access to the herbarium of his patron, Sir Joseph Banks, which included the specimens he had collected during Flinders' voyage, and which contained the most extensive collection of Proteaceae in the world. He was also given access to James Edward Smith's Linnean collection; the herbarium of Aylmer Bourke Lambert; the living collections of George Hibbert; the herbarium of William Aiton, which contained the collections of Francis Masson; and the collections of William Roxburgh. In addition he was accorded a brief examination of the specimens collected by Jacques Labillardière at Esperance Bay, on the southwest coast of Australia, where Brown had not collected.
Content.
Brown's paper was read to the Linnean Society of London in four parts, on 17 January, 7 February, 21 February and 7 March 1809. The Council of the Society approved it for publication on 2 May, but it did not appear in print until 8 March 1810. It was published as a separate offprint under the title "On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae", and then appeared in Volume 10, Part 1 of "Transactions of the Linnean Society of London", under the title "On the Proteaceae of Jussieu". It was illustrated by two Ferdinand Bauer plates, depicting "Knightia excelsa" and "Dryandra formosa" (now "Banksia formosa").
The paper begins with a digression, presenting Brown's observations on undeveloped Asclepiadaceae flowers as evidence of the importance of studying developing flowers as well as mature ones. It then discusses the biogeography of Proteaceae, noting the southern hemisphere (that is, Gondwanan) distribution of the family, and that "he most numerous genera are also the most widely diffused." Brown then discusses the morphology of the family, including a discussion of pollen shape; according to David Mabberley this represents "the first major study of the subject, palynology".
The systematics section follows, and is most important for the large number of new taxa published therein. 404 species in 38 genera are listed. 18 of the genera are new, and nearly all of these are still upheld. The arrangement of these genera largely follows that introduced by Richard Salisbury in his 1806 "The Paradisus Londinensis", although Brown asserts that he arrived at his arrangement independently. Brown does introduce one important concept, however: his division of the Proteaceae into two subfamilies based on whether or not the fruit dehisces. This is still considered the fundamental division in the family, though opinion has varied on whether the defining character should be fruit dehiscence or paired flowers.
Overall, the paper was very well received; according to Mabberley, "he paper was masterful and commanded respect for Brown as a brilliant botanist."
Controversy.
Shortly after the reading of "On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae", but before it appeared in print, there appeared a publication that started one of the most bitter disputes in 19th century botany. This was "On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae", ostensibly by Joseph Knight. Despite the title, this paper contained only 13 pages related to cultivation techniques, but over 100 pages of taxonomic revision. Although not explicitly attributed, it was widely believed, and is still so, that this revision was contributed by Richard Salisbury, who had been present at all four of the meetings at which Brown read his paper. The revision contains many of the plant names that Brown had presented to the Linnean Society; for example, the genera "Petrophile", "Isopogon" and "Grevillea". Thus Salisbury beat Brown to print, claiming priority for the names that Brown had authored. Salisbury is also accused of having appropriated some of Brown's observations; for example, in the Linnean Society copy of Knight's paper, where Salisbury says that he suspects that the fruit of "Persoonia" is unusual, Brown has pencilled in "He suspects it because he listened very attentively to my paper when read at the Linnean Society."
Salisbury was accused of plagiarism and ostracised from botanical circles. Contemporary notes and letters indicate widespread condemnation of Salisbury's actions. For example, Samuel Goodenough wrote "How shocked was I to see Salisbury's surreptitious anticipation of Brown's paper on new Holland plants, under the name and disguise of Mr. Hibbert's gardener! Oh it is too bad!"; and James Edward Smith wrote that he had a copy of Knight's paper "but shall not keep it—I mean hereafter not to notice it or any other of the author's productions." Brown himself wrote of Salisbury "I scarcely know what to think of him except that he stands between a rogue and a fool."
With the passage of time, some dissenting views have emerged. In 1870, Charles Babbington wrote that "Knight's Proteaceae is very curious if the best part of it was really carried away from a Linnean meeting and appropriated by Salisbury to tease R. Brown"; and other authors have since denied Salisbury's involvement. In 1886, James Britten noted that Smith had earlier deliberately acted to suppress a genus name published by Salisbury, and that there was an understanding among botanical leaders of the period, including Brown, Banks and Smith, that Salisbury's names should be ignored, partly because Salisbury supported de Jussieu's natural system of classification rather than the sexual system of Linnaeus. In 1985 David Mabberley offered the following in Salisbury's defence: "If Salisbury was guilty, why did he do it? ... o doubt Salisbury felt that Brown was encroaching on his territory, for he had been writing on, and studying, Proteaceae for some time, and here was the Librarian of Smith's Linnean Society dashing off a paper to get his names into "Hortus kewensis", criticizing Salisbury and abandoning some of his names on the way. It seems not inconceivable, therefore, that Salisbury... would have made amendments to Knight's final manuscript in the light of Brown's remarks... and hurried it through the press to defeat the machinations of his enemy."

Vegetation Survey of Western Australia

The Vegetation Survey of Western Australia commenced as a project of the Department of Geography of the University of Western Australia to provide vegetation maps for the state on the scales of 1:250,000 and 1:1,000,000. There were some offshoot publications apart from the maps and notes The main author and worker of the whole project was John Stanley Beard who received an OAM for the work in 2003.
The Maps correlated broadly to the main regional names:

Springfield Road (SEPTA Route 101 station)

Springfield Road Route 101 is a stop along the SEPTA Media (Route 101) trolley line. It is located on Springfield Road between Windsor Circle and North Brookside Road in Springfield, Pennsylvania, although SEPTA gives the address as being near Springfield & Rolling Roads. Passengers should be careful not to confuse this stop with the Springfield Road stop on SEPTA's Route 102 trolley in Clifton Heights, PA, a few miles to the east.
Trolleys arriving at this station travel between 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Orange Street in Media, Pennsylvania. The major SEPTA 101 line improvement project of 2008-2010 expanded, modernized, and refurbished this facility. Inbound (toward 69th Street Terminal) trolleys stop for passengers on the north side of Springfield Road at a platform equipped with a large shed with overhanging roof. A second, smaller shelter was added to the inbound platform. Outbound trolleys stop along a new (2009) platform along the south side of Springfield Road, adjacent to the sizeable station parking lot. This long platform has two open-air metal benches and a bench in a small, roofed shelter to protect waiting passengers during inclement weather. The lighted, landscaped, free parking lot by this platform offers parking for approximately 30 vehicles, and includes spaces for handicapped drivers and a bicycle rack. Several additional free parking spaces for cars line the outbound tracks along North Rolling Road on the north side of Springfield Road across from Windsor Circle.

Sotilasmestari

Sotilasmestari (Militärmästare in Swedish, Chief Warrant Officer or Sergeant Major in English) is a Finnish military rank above Ylivääpeli (Överfältväbel) and below Vänrikki (Fänrik).
History and related ranks.
The rank derives from the "erikoismestari" ("Master Specialist") rank that was originally available only in some branches of service. Early in the history of independent Finland's armed forces, graduates of the professional NCO school (see "Maanpuolustusopisto") were promoted to "vääpeli" ("Sergeant First Class") upon graduation, but could not be promoted further, which led to frustration among outstandingly competent NCOs. Because of this, the "erikoismestari" rank was made available to all branches, and renamed "sotilasmestari" (Sergeant Major, "Master of the Military" directly translated from Finnish). Furthermore, the rank of "ylivääpeli" ("Master Sergeant") was also introduced. A Finnish speciality was that "sotilasmestari" was ranked higher in Finnish army than "vänrikki" (Second Lieutenant) in peace time. That was because "sotilasmestari" was a professional soldier with decades of experience, but "vänrikki" (Second Lieutenant) was a young reservist or a fresh graduate of the Cadet School. In wartime, the tables turned and "vänrikki" (Second Lieutenant) rank was higher than "sotilasmestari".
In a 1993 reform, the professional NCO school (Maanpuolustusopisto) was "upgraded" such that graduates received the rank of "vänrikki" (Second Lieutenant) upon graduation, and the intermediate ranks ("vääpeli, ylivääpeli, sotilasmestari") were no longer actively awarded. The old NCOs with these ranks in active service were automatically promoted to officers overnight in August 1994. The rank of "sotilasmestari" remained active until the last NCOs with the rank retired, or were promoted to "luutnantti" (First Lieutenant).
The professional NCO corps was founded again in 2007, and these ranks were reactivated. Only the old Finnish speciality that "sotilasmestari" was senior to "vänrikki" in peacetime was abolished.
